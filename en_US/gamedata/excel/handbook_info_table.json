The current, most reliable information comes from Silence's own writings about her experiences as well as other aspects of her life. \nAccording to her recollection, Silence's relationship with Rhine Lab and Originium began during her days as a student, when she accompanied her mentor to the company. \nAt that time, Rhine Lab was holding a scientific exhibition to show off the results of its research from a tour of Columbia. The new medical equipment she saw optimized Originium transmission efficiency based upon new results obtained from live trials, making possible a whole new generation of dazzling treatments. \nAfter completing her studies, Silence's wish came true and she was allowed to join Rhine Lab as an employee. She had an extraordinary talent for Originium Arts, and soon got the opportunity to participate in several experimental projects related to important Originium technology and clinical treatment. \nBut as well as her career was going, and as much as the upper levels of the company recognized her achievements, Silence never forgot her original dream - to join the Originium Technology and Life Science Applications project. \n\n\"I never thought the opportunity would come so soon.\" \nLooking back on this time, Silence let slip a sly smile.",

It was not fitted with a weapon, instead its only designated function was to provide timely treatment for Operators on the battlefield. \nMedicine that has undergone several rounds of testing by the Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Team can be assembled into the drone's kits in a variety of ways. The drone can use aerosolized medicine, it can spray, it can inject, and it can simulate a medic's treatment wand. It can switch between these modes depending on the needs of the terrain and the environment, and the specific situation of the Operator in need of healing. \nHowever, this medical drone is still in its experimental stages. Because it needs to be lightweight and convenient, it needs to be a kind of throwaway and relatively fragile low-value target. Additionally, in areas with strong signal interference and complex terrain, its efficiency will be affected to a certain degree. \nEven so, it still provides Rhodes Island Operators with quality treatment. Better still, this is only the first gift that Silence has brought to Rhodes Island.",

Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment was unsuccessful.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more demanding patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at the other company. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overconfident most of the time, even bordering on egotistical. She is extremely impulsive, ready to act the second an idea pops into her mind, no matter how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, the outstanding form her Originium Arts take must be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement her talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in her emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, her instincts push her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way. As a result, even if she never intended to do so, she has saved many lives.",

However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from typical Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains particular talent for Originium Arts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have proven an unexpected obstacle to the medical team's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic nerve pain and even occasional hallucinations. Records describe these hallucinations as enormous apparitions that are tremendously painful for her, or depictions of charred corpses and immolated animals, or close personal relations consumed by a sea of agonizing fire. The causes of these apparitions have proven elusive to all medical and mechanical analyses. It is possible that this ongoing torment is the source of her irascible character. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even by Rhodes Island standards. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Classified Log]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite peculiar. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure...

This has meant that the people of Kjerag have not needed to rely on nomadic cities to live and work. Of course, the steep terrain has also slowed Kjerag's development considerably. \nThe name of the Karlan Trade Company is probably derived from the name of the holy mountain the believers of Kjerag worship. \nThe trade company, run by SilverAsh, is the only window to the outside world for the insular and conservative nation of Kjerag. At the same time, this company has unavoidably changed the country. \nIt would be wise for Rhodes Island to research SilverAsh's record, given this level of power and vision.",

LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island. \nWhatever the case, the other Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled. \nSilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them. \nWhether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with political conspiracy and such machinations are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself, as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \n Dr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh.

Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. Perhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nThereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nNow according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament. \nIn what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

The conflict between the Kjerag conservative faction and the reformist party have gotten more and more intense.\nOn the surface, the Karlan Trade Company is only concerned with foreign trade. However, its true owner is none other than Enciodes Silverash, head of the Silverash Family and opponent of the two conservative houses in the country's parliament.\nYou may also know him as SilverAsh, brother of Rhodes Island Operator Cliffheart.\nI am convinced that the Karlan Trade Company doesn't pay a cent to the government of Kjerag. It isn't a state-owned enterprise! Its operations and business are controlled entirely by SilverAsh himself!\nModern military equipment has passed from Raythean's hands, through the Karlan Trade Company's channels, and into Kjerag. The conservative faction doesn't even have any means of tracing the whereabouts of the goods.\nThe trade route has already been moved to the foot of the holy mountain, Karlan. The Vine-Bear Court has already used SilverAsh's sister, Saint Pramanix, as leverage to try to get the Silverash family to leave the Three House Parliament and hand over control of the valley and mining sites.\nThe troops the Karlan Trade Company sent to the training camps have already returned from Ascarat County in Victoria. Where are they now? The conservative Kjerag guards don't have any idea.\nSo what does Kjerag need most right now? We are reaching a boiling point here.

Just the tiniest little push...\nThe avalanche will bury all of Kjerag, including all of its conspiracies and all of the matters of the past.\n\nI admit that perhaps the Karlan Trade Company isn't hiding anything dangerous.\nEven so, should we really put ourselves in danger just because Cliffheart received a secret letter?\nAt the very least, Rhodes Island as a whole should not assume this magnitude of risk.\n\n--Dobermann, at the meeting 12 days before the incident at the mountain.",

The official contract is too long and complicated to go into here, though it could probably be summed up in three clauses: \nOne, Penguin Logistics is responsible for Sora's personal safety, and must not let her make any appearance that would damage her image as a pop idol. \nTwo, wherever Sora goes on a mission, Penguin Logistics is obligated to do their best to promote her and increase her popularity as they see fit, as well as absorbing all costs incurred. \nThree, including events or activities described in Clause 2, all revenue derived from Sora's performance as an entertainer must go to the management agency. \nViolation of any clause is ground for the agency to terminate the contract to revoke Sora as an Operator. \nFollowing PL's partnership with Rhodes Island, the latter also assumed all the obligations.

It is very easy to overlook her light gear and weapons, leading to a gross underestimation of her combat prowess. \nOn the other hand, the close-up melee style she prefers also can put her in peril.

Her parents worked at William University, her father a graduate professor for the School of Originium, her mother an environmental and ecological research specialist. The couple died in a volcanic eruption during a survey. \nEyjafjalla's parents had begun a project to study natural Catastrophes on Terra, and the volcano was a key site. Among the files Eyjafjalla took with her to Rhodes Island, she treasured the report on that volcano most of all. She didn't want the study to end with the passing of her parents, so she decided to continue it in their stead. \nVolcanic research must be done on-site before eruption and required long-term close-range observation. Particles with Originium components tended to be common in volcanic areas, and cooling lava constantly turned over new Originium veins, making the region a breeding ground for Oripathy. This is believed to be the reason for Eyjafjalla's infection.",

By further analyzing these data, Deepcolor can summarize her subjects' private information that most intelligence operatives would need long periods of observation to acquire, such as lifestyle choices and daily habits. \nAccording to Deepcolor's personal account, this is nothing but a basic skill possessed by all painters, and she is still at the shoal of the sea of art.\nNote 1: The sea she describes and the \"Deep\" in her code name are strange concepts for some Operators. Please see it as \"boundless water.\"\nNote 2: After rejecting Deepcolor's request to paint a portrait of the creator of this file, the profiler still received a sketch from her.",

Her combat style isn't exactly orthodox--air-painting is not a known Artcasting method, nor is it easy to comprehend. \nFurthermore, perhaps most difficult to understand are the creatures she commands, dubbed \"helpers\" (or \"tentacles\" by nosy Operators). The reason these long, thin threads are called \"creatures\" is because they possess the intelligence and mobility of a pet trained to follow orders, greatly adding to Deepcolor's combat flexibility. After comparisons to the \"Meeboos\" created by Mayer of the Rijn Life Research Center, these creatures are actually mechanical entities defying any existing classification. They have spindly bodies without noses, mouths, or ears. \nAccording to Deepcolor's own reports, these creatures were captured by her father somewhere in faraway Sargon as a gift to her. She summed up the \"helpers\" as merely \"as yet unclassified creatures.\"",

Most of the lances were left to collect dust in the storehouse. Even though Vigna had enough cash for a better weapon, she saw the lance in the corner and right off the bat knew she had to have it. \nWielding the lance requires great strength and skill, so Vigna doubled her daily training regimen. And to improve the power of the lance, she contacted the original manufacturer and custom-ordered a new model in pursuit of the perfect build. \nAfter her modifications, her lance is now a light, keen, durable, and powerful weapon. Vigna herself has also stepped up her own personal combat training in order to improve her mastery over the unique tool. \nVigna has never felt she could or would ever quit.

That earned her a personal invite from Wei Yenwu, Chief Executive of Lungmen, as well as headlines in all the newspapers. \nWith Wei's and the L.G.D's support, Shaw was accepted into Rhodes Island for her expertise in fire safety and prevention. It was an obvious boon to the island, since most Operators have little to no knowledge of or training in firefighting. Shaw handily filled the gap. \nWhen Shaw had the chance to inspect the intricate passageways and firefighting equipment on the island, and after meeting certain Operators who wield fire Arts at will, she realized she faced a daunting task.",

The first seminar commenced with the notable absence of Dr. Kal'tsit, where Shaw presented materials and slides (including various scenes of major fires and warning signs). The presentation was short, thanks to Shaw's famously fast rate of speech, and the raucous applause made it clear the audience had no clue what she had intended to communicate to them.

She devised a plan to buy time, using the town streets and houses to mitigate the attack. She eventually forced the bandits to give up. \nHowever, when she went to rescue a child kidnapped by an outlaw, she took a hit to her left arm. \nAfter returning to Rhodes Island, the Operators discussed her course of action: \"She continued pursuing the enemy, but did she violate the directives of the operation?\" \nThey came to the conclusion that while she did break some rules, without her efforts, the mission would have failed. \nGrani made the right call.",

It's beside the point, but that team was the prototype for the Guard Department's Special Inspection Unit. There were a lot of tabloids and novels written about them. \nAnyway, they pulled it off. The ringleader was executed and most of his accomplices were killed on the spot. \nThe hostage? She was just a little girl. The kidnappers clearly didn't think about how traumatic the experience would be for her. \nShe didn't end up seeing anything gruesome. She saw a Lungmen police officer rushing out. She saw the heavy Christmas snowfall. She saw the street lamps and the Christmas tree outside the abandoned building.

School, and no one questions her ability, dedication, or hatred of her enemies. Police officers working with Ch'en often complained about her demeanor--too strict and too harsh. Everyone thought that this harsh character would disappear in the struggle for power, and she would soften up after being worn down by endless incidents. \nSurprisingly, both crime and casualty rates have declined in the past two years, and the younger generation of officers began being promoted faster and more substantively. Ch'en was promoted and joined one of the most important teams in the Department, the Special Inspection Unit. \nMembers of this unit are generally not allowed to serve more than two years - to protect their lives and reduce their stress. Perhaps this position isn't suitable to serve for a long time: old inspectors' careers always seem to end with heroic sacrifice. \nCh'en did not retreat. She doesn't even know how to back down. \nShe became the fastest promoted officer in the history of the Lungmen police force, and also the youngest Special Inspector in the Department. Those who ridiculed her were impressed by her perseverance. After all, planning for the future is one thing. Planning every day is another. \nWhy was she so hard? Why live life this way?

During the course of treatment, Astesia took her sister's advice to join Rhodes Island.\nAstesia is quite skilled with a sword. Her family has passed down a form of ceremonial swordplay: a ritual in which one hand holds a celestial orb, while the other holds an originium sword.

As far as we know, the connection between astrology and originium Arts is very weak, despite most illustrious astrologers in recent years all agreeing with a level of certainty on a close link between the expression of originium Arts and the celestial bodies. At this point we still have no evidence to support a direct or indirect connection, but we speculate that the emergence of these originium Arts that appear to be linked to the celestial bodies will further convince the common people of these beliefs. Were it not for these techniques, most people would likely return to the scientific explanations for orginium Arts, turning away from astrology.\nBack to Astesia, she has reported that she feels her own abilities are weakening. Our observations show that contracting Oripathy has had an effect on the originium Arts she already possessed. These effects will persist for quite some time, but we cannot say what the outcome will be, and whether it will be good or bad for Astesia. We need more time for observation and research.

Independent city-states, however, are.\nIt should be said that in the context of the present day, the social collectives referred to by \"nation\" were city-states in the past. The predecessors of several nations were independent cities gathered together. Additionally, even today, some nomadic cities that nominally belong to certain nations still to varying degrees retain the customs and traditions of the city as opposed to those of the nation.\nHowever, it must be conceded that the concept of an independent city is falling by the wayside, although the old-fashioned and elderly might refuse to admit it. That is because the concept of a nation is more powerful.\nNow, even though there is still a considerable number of independent cities on Terra, their leaders have already recognized that independent cities are no match for nations. In recent years, there have been many such independent cities that have surrendered to neighboring nations.\nHowever, Siesta's special characteristics may be able to take them in a new direction.",

In fact, the discipline of Originium Research has a large number of sub-categories, both in the applied area of the doctrine as well as the theoretical. Ceylon specializes in researching the history of applied development of Originium. \nBefore the modern academics managed to specialize the research, many precious historical materials on Originium were not well preserved. In fact, collecting clues from past historical data to infer the paths of development of the various Originium schools was also an important part of modern Originium research.\nAlthough today, with the development of science and technology, the study of historical materials has gradually become less concerned with the development of theory and more the verification of it. Of course, the importance of recording history itself is self-evident for the meaning of a civilization.\nNaturally, although Ceylon has only just graduated from university, her intellectual reserves and enthusiasm for the study of Originium is breath-taking, and one can clearly see how much effort Ceylon put into her studies. For Rhodes Island, the addition of such an outstanding talent is a most unexpected surprise.",

However, these methods often come at considerable cost to herself.\nPerhaps Schwarz does not have as much experience in dealing with monsters as other operators do, but she is uniquely capable among Rhodes Island operators at dealing with human and humanoid foes. In the words of one operator, \"She is like a machine designed specifically to ruthlessly kill humans.\"\nHowever, in the presence of Ceylon, she may still be cold, but she betrays a softer side. Her relationship with Ceylon is less a simple master-servant relationship, and more of a relationship between sisters on equal-footing. She dotes heavily upon her younger sister and will satisfy any of her requests, no matter how unreasonable. She shows tolerance even for her most whimsical notions, and her normally cold voice possesses a certain pampering tone.\nIt is only in these moments that she appears to transform from a machine to a person, in the eyes of spectators.

However, during the event, she chose to stand on the other side. Though she was forgiven, this has still ultimately been taken as a betrayal, and has caused a chain reaction of events.\nIn the analysis of the incident, we can see that the real reason she took the other side was because that she has an inclination toward the city's Mayor, Herman. It is true that she deeply loves Ceylon, but she is not just her puppet. Theoretically, as the mayor's agent, she ought to be the one who understands him the most. Her quote, \"When it's time to shed blood, do not send Lady Ceylon to do it, send someone who lives amongst the shadows,\" is likely an accurate representation of her mentality on this.\nDespite bearing witness to the event, after joining Rhodes Island, Ceylon has still shown some idealistic tendencies. This is normal. She witnessed some of the cruelty that this world is capable of, but the relatively neat resolution to this incident has lightened some of the shock of it. Moreover, not everyone needs to have a deep understanding of this so-called cruel reality.\nHowever, this brings us to the salient point of this discussion: What position should Rhodes Island take on this issue?\nPeople like Ceylon are not a minority in Rhodes Island. Rhodes Island is not purely a research institution and thus our nature determines that we will sometimes come face-to-face with unsavory situations. Do we have an obligation or necessity to expose these members to cruelties they've never experienced before? Or is it enough to abide by Schwarz's quote and \"Send someone who lives amongst the shadows?\"\nThis is a topic worth discussing in more detail.\n——Archivist R.F.",

Actually, aside from giving you a detailed description of the bushes and shrubs I hid in, there isn't much I can tell you. Wait, and then attack - it really is that simple.\nI was born into a family of Rim Billiton merchants. Both of my parents were traders. When I was six years old, they were involved in a deal in which they were tricked into collecting a number of Originium Stones disguised as ordinary gems. I was infected with Oripathy when I stole some of these stones to play with them.\nAfter my parents found out, they went to confront those who had tricked them, but were ambushed and killed en route. I was treated like a slave and sold. In the end, I was selected by a mercenary unit to become their newest member.\nIn addition to carrying out war operations, this mercenary unit was also responsible for carrying out tasks for important men, mostly their dirty work. After I passed their training, I became a child assassin. After several missions, my organization was tasked with staging some \"accidents\" in a certain city.\nThat is where my fate changed.\nMy task was to assassinate Lady Ceylon's father, but in the process of getting close to him, he subdued me. You can't even imagine. He was a... Forget it, I won't even bring it up. In short, I helped him eliminate my entire mercenary unit. Afterward, I became part-housekeeper, part-bodyguard. That year, Lady Ceylon was three years old, and I was 12.\nActually, what Lady Ceylon doesn't know is that during those years I was a bodyguard, I also helped her father with other matters... Don't get me wrong, I was willing to. The person I care about most is Lady Ceylon but the person I respect the most was her father. That still hasn't changed after all this time.\n......That day, he called me back to Siesta and told me that he found my enemies. Before I set out, he asked me \"Are you sure you want to go? You can live a good life here, Schwarz.\" Ultimately, I went, but not just for revenge, but also to make a clean break. Also, I knew that somebody was waiting for me.\"\n——This story was related by the Doctor personally.

Part of this hatred is derived from his desire to protect the clinic, and the other part is due to reasons unknown.\nThough Hellagur is by no means a defeatist, he still has taken a hardline attitude toward operations in the Ursus area.\nHowever, when analyzing the military power of Ursus, he has said \"No political entity should come into direct conflict with Ursus. Even if its corruption and fanaticism will eventually destroy it, it's still the most fearsome force in the land.\"\nFrom this point of view it could be said that as an infected himself, Hellagur's opinions on many matters are far more critical than those of other infected.\nAll strategically-minded operators have their own thoughts on the situation, and they're all well aware of Rhodes Island's true circumstances in it. Hellagur's relationship with Ursus may make a small number of operators distrustful. But operators who attended the strategic meetings all understand Hellagur's true intentions.\n\nBut Hellagur's words contain no contradictions. He believes that as an infected, he is already on Ursus's opposing side -- \n\n\"However, once Ursus looks at you, you will know the difference between being an enemy of Ursus, and Ursus regarding you as one.\"",

His friend was the commander of the enemy army, the target of his mission, and was identified as a core figure in the enemy army by Ursus. \nThe second trauma was when a terrible battle broke out between him and the person he trusted the most. After the battle, he was still standing, but the fate of the other person is unknown, as if he died in some unknown alley somewhere.\n\nThe first time, his friend entrusted him with a blade called \"Kudarikiri,\" and a young infected girl named Neon.\nThe second time, the person he trusted left him a black market clinic called \"Azazel,\" as well as a conviction.\n\nHellagur knew his friend had plotted Ursus's defeat, but Hellagur would not blame him.\nHellagur knew that the child he trusted had instigated the entire betrayal and injured all of the infected in the clinic, but Hellagur would not hate this child.\n\nHe often refers to himself as a warrior. Perhaps this is because he doesn't know how to face everything Ursus has done to him.\nMaybe a little bit of hope is the only motivation he has to keep on living.\"\n\nAlthough these conclusions unavoidably contain some of the opinions of the individual who collected this intelligence, we still trust in her ability to organize clues.\nOur response to the incident depends on the decision itself, but at the very least, we may already understand the reason why the General often merely sighs at Miss Neon's improper behavior.",

He earned a major reputation during the Tenth Urcha War. An Ursus soldier with these kinds of achievements is rare indeed.\nDuring the Bloodpeak Campaign, he established a glowing military record but then vanished without a trace. There is only one high-ranking Ursus commander that meets these conditions.\nAs for how I made the inference, well, it's just a guess! Over several decades, Ursus has executed over a hundred commanders. The few left alive can be counted on one hand. Consult a registry of names to get the answer!\nIn the past, both Kal'tsit and I would have been opposed to this cooperation. But these are different times. Even■■■■feels that the situation is getting quite thorny.\nKal'tsit believes that after the Chernobog Incident, the Ursus authorities will carry out a frantic counter-attack and that this should be handled through the Ursus infected community.\nMy thinking is a bit simpler. Azazel is buried so deeply that if Rhodes Island dug them out, Ursus wouldn't have much of an opinion on it. Anyway, they're not too familiar with them.\nThe more cards we have to play, the better, and it's not about who plays their cards first. Warfarin also really wants to get her hands on Azazel's technology. Just look at it as me trying to do someone a favor, all right?\nHowever, the Doctor absolutely refuses to let me see Hellagur's writings! Damn it. What's wrong with taking a peek? I'm not going to forget this!\n\nBut what exactly is the General thinking about? Or who exactly is still supporting him?\nSince the Bloodpeak Campaign, the nobility and the new politicians have been using this opportunity to eliminate military forces. Hellagur has been very lucky to survive judgment. Of course, this may be the benefit of his never having participated in politics, but think about this: neither the army nor the politicians will be content with the current situation. They'll both have the next step planned.\nHe'll never divulge much about Azazel. Maybe its secrets are as terrifying as his experiences. Kal'tsit knows that Hellagur isn't Azazel's main leader.\nThis isn't over. His experience, his country, the things he cares about will all drag him down eventually. When the time comes, it may not be up to us whether we can lend him a hand or not.\n——■■■",

She trained the kids, with great frustration, and they in turn changed her disposition. In time, she grew to accept the soldiers as her own. For the sake of their training, she traded her dual electric swords for the sword and shield combo she uses today. She put her heart and soul into her men, right up until the point when the brass decided to send them on a suicide mission. Dur-nar was beside herself. She flew into a rage and assaulted a suprior officer. She has been unwilling to discuss the events that followed. According to certain documents we've acquired, she was forcibly discharged. She then went through a period of hopping from security to police to mercenary work for short stints, up until she arrived at Rhodes Island. When the Doctor asked her in private why she had come to join Rhodes Island, she produced a letter. It was a letter of thanks from the few survivors of her squad of trainees. At the end of the letter, the Doctor fixated on a particular sentence, \"If there were a place where the command actually cared about the grunts, would you give it a try?\" After that was an address to send her resume to Rhodes Island, along with all the names of the survivors.\n\n\"And that's why I'm here.\"",

That is, until they are discovered, and they make a break for it, barely escaping, dripping with sweat, struggling to breathe. \nEthan was one of them. He couldn't fight, and he couldn't talk trash.

And with his nigh-invisibility, getting away from those who would stop him was trivial. \nThe city's dark nights had become chaotic and unpredictable. \nBut Ethan didn't care. All he had to do was run away. He could even help the other Savras get away. No one was as good at escaping as them.

The political entities founded on deeply held beliefs go beyond Laterano alone, and the uniqueness of their citizenry cannot be attributed to piety or self-discipline alone. \nThis is also not to say that executors, including Executor, are not themselves strong. Last week, I saw him tear out the aorta of a vicious beast with his bare hands, spraying his partner with blood. That was not the first time an operator came crying to me that \"Executor is terrifying,\" and it certainly won't be the last. \nBut for the hands of its few lawyers, executors, wandering judges, and the Pope himself, Laterano can do little more than proclaim that the law must be followed. \nIn addition to its temporal statutes, Laterano must have another, higher order of law that we cannot perceive. Rather than saying the executor is one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, it would be more appropriate to say that the executor is the physical manifestation that Laterano created to befit the name of the law. At least that's my opinion. \n\nAll I want to know is what Executor meant by \"the statute that takes effect once a shot is fired\".

But found herself seriously injured and knocked unconscious by a wild beast. Fortunately, she was rescued by an elderly hunter passing by. In order to save her life, she had no choice but to give up her wounded arm. When Vermeil awakened and realized the position she was in, she devoted herself to a quick recovery. She overcame her pain, and rapidly adapted to the use of her prosthetic. \nVermeil continued to hunt her goal, down the path of revenge. The only one she spared was an elderly mercenary, long since retired, surrounded by children and grandchildren. She took only his left arm and a medal symbolizing his honor as a mercenary, sparing his life. At this point, Vermeil has suspended her retaliation against the Ursus.",

At first, she only had a mix of truth and untruths she picked up from a few people who had previously come into contact with the Infected. Not knowing how to deal with the disease, she chose to endure the pain, just as she had endured the pain of losing her arm before. Pain is pain, she assumed. \nThe number of Infected increased day by day, and the term \"Infected\" seemed to be on everyone's lips. It was only when others began to notice Vermeil's disease that things began to change. Rumors of Oripathy and fear of the Infected gradually evolved into persecution and expulsion. Vermeil lost all ability to handle the situation, overcome with the pain of her disease. \nBut Vermeil did not have any special opinion about her disease. She treated it as just another one of life's difficulties that couldn't be avoided. Even as she became known as Infected, even as she was discriminated against, she did not begrudge those who mistrusted her. She just avoided them. \nIf she could find a cure, she would go to it. If she couldn't, she would endure it until she couldn't walk. Just as she accepted the loss of her arm, Vermeil accepted herself as an Infected.",

Tangentially, though I would prefer not to say too much, it was a certain individual from the Laterano Notarial Hall who led Vermeil to Rhodes Island, and who at a certain point signed a cooperation agreement with Rhodes Island, and who works for Rhodes Island as an operator. \nTaking into account the information we needed to maintain Vermeil's prosthetic, we made several inquiries. Unexpectedly, the result of our inquiries came back to reveal that a Laterano mechanic was living in the mountain forests of Siracusa, pretending to be a local huntsman. The name of the mechanic matched that on a check covering Vermeil's medical bills. Although she herself has chosen to keep silent about her savior, she has always demonstrated great respect and admiration for Laterano people. \nSince the operator herself has not been willing to reveal the details, let us leave this story buried in Vermeil's memory. That may be for the best.",
