In traditional Victorian society, the arts are an important part of a woman's formal education.\nIn addition, in order to strengthen her weak constitution, Melantha's parents arranged for her to study swordsmanship and other popular upper-class sports.\nAfter the Infected crisis broke out, Melantha was herself Infected. Her parents arranged for her to receive treatment from Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical's. And before long, she was on the way to the company for treatment.",

In both life and on the battlefield, they maintain a strong and complementary relationship. \nMelantha also has great respect for the mature and dependable Operator Steward. She feels both guilty and grateful to Ansel, who is in charge of maintaining her health records as well as providing her with daily treatment. Finally, Adnachiel is the Operator that Melantha understands the least. Since the beginning, she has struggled to figure out what this kid from Laterano might be thinking. Nevertheless, Adnachiel hasn't caused any problems in battle. \nDuring her tenure as captain, her subordinates have all spoken highly of her attentive and careful nature.

This is one of Melantha's few mysteries. \nJudging from test records and daily battle videos, her swordsmanship appears to have originated from the Victorian traditional duelist's style, but at some point during her training, she must have picked up some heavy influences from Eastern sword arts. \nMelantha's weapon can also be looked at as a kind of circumstantial evidence for this. She uses an exceptionally fine yet extremely sharp straight sword. Current data makes clear that this weapon is only used in Yan and some parts of the Far East. \nMelantha's swordsmanship is agile and her skills are outstanding. In terms of combat techniques, Melantha has is skilled in tactical assault. Even without support, she can rely upon her mobility to move about the battlefield and hide when necessary. \nOn the other hand, Melantha lacks the ability for effective direct confrontation and she displays certain deficiencies in stability during high-intensity operations.\nUp until now, Melantha has trained under the guidance of Franka.",

Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment was unsuccessful.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more demanding patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at the other company. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overconfident most of the time, even bordering on egotistical. She is extremely impulsive, ready to act the second an idea pops into her mind, no matter how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, the outstanding form her Originium Arts take must be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement her talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in her emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, her instincts push her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way. As a result, even if she never intended to do so, she has saved many lives.",

However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from typical Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains particular talent for Originium Arts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have proven an unexpected obstacle to the medical team's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic nerve pain and even occasional hallucinations. Records describe these hallucinations as enormous apparitions that are tremendously painful for her, or depictions of charred corpses and immolated animals, or close personal relations consumed by a sea of agonizing fire. The causes of these apparitions have proven elusive to all medical and mechanical analyses. It is possible that this ongoing torment is the source of her irascible character. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even by Rhodes Island standards. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Classified Log]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite peculiar. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure...

However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with political conspiracy and such machinations are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself, as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \n Dr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh.

Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. Perhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nThereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nNow according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament. \nIn what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

Moreover, it comes from the deepest depths of the forest. \nOnly in the deepest part of the forest can you hear the quiet and yet deafening silence. \nFirewatch once said that the people of her race and her friends are all buried there. \nJust what has she been through?",

Some live in Ursus and the northern region of Kazimierz. Therefore, they enjoy small and medium-sized instruments. Aside from the harmonica, they also enjoy the flute, the fiddle, and the guitar.\nPlaying these instruments does not require using much energy. Given that the Elafian people spend all year long in autumnal and wintry climates, this makes these instruments suitable for their way of life. Moreover, it only takes one musician to send the whole room into an emotional state of joy or sorrow.\nSometimes, Firewatch will sit alone upon a bridge and play her harmonica. Each time she does this, she sits facing the north.\nWhenever I hear that harmonica and its mellifluous yet sad voice upon the wind, my heart follows as well and drifts towards the mountains and forests of the north.",

No way. I was foolish to assume what she has in her hand all the time is a normal Arts staff... \nI don't know why she doesn't use a sword. Her expression was... loathing?

Even when the topic came up in casual conversation, they would deftly skip over it. In addition, they seldom talk about how they met Siege. \nSiege, however, said she clearly remembers defeating Indra from the gang. She makes a point to remember every meeting, every action, and every word of those she interacts with. \nMany Operators believe that she deserves to lead, and that Rhodes Island needs to make a more pointed effort to understand Siege.",

It is especially effective against targets in heavy metal armor. It is very easy to overlook her light gear and weapons, leading to a gross underestimation of her combat prowess. \nOn the other hand, the close-up melee style she prefers also can put her in peril. While she may be good enough to end the enemy before her life is threatened, to alleviate concerns, the head of the BPRS project teamed the smart but radical Franka with the level-headed Liskarm, making them a complementary duo in combat.",

The couple died in a volcanic eruption during a survey. \nEyjafjalla's parents had begun a project to study natural Catastrophes on Terra, and the volcano was a key site. Among the files Eyjafjalla took with her to Rhodes Island, she treasured the report on that volcano most of all. She didn't want the study to end with the passing of her parents, so she decided to continue it in their stead. \nVolcanic research must be done on-site before eruption and required long-term close-range observation. Particles with Originium components tended to be common in volcanic areas, and cooling lava constantly turned over new Originium veins, making the region a breeding ground for Oripathy. This is believed to be the reason for Eyjafjalla's infection.",

They really are ordinary creatures. When Mousse is not around to supervise them, they roam the island, climb up to high places and look down on things below. They seem to leave footprints in the corridor, deliberately announcing their presence with their elegant paws. They have fur and parts matching those of a normal animal, with biological functions to match, as Operators who come across their droppings could attest--and a problem eventually solved with dedicated effort from Mousse, Jessica, Provence and several others. \nMousse has apologized for the trouble... with a sad expression reminiscent of her pets. Given her sincere apology and her promise to train the 'kitties,' such transgressions have been expunged from her official record.",

It is obvious that she is very proficient and highly experienced with the game of baseball. And yet, observation showed that Cuora possesses very little actual combat experience. With her familiarity with baseball, she has been able to grasp mission plans, objectives and strategies far easier than one would expect from an inexperienced Operator. \nAfter positive responses to Cuora's baseball presentations, she gleefully unpacked her bag and handed every Operator present a baseball. \nHold on.

Several Operators reportedly experienced sudden, unexplained blackouts in the early days, only to wake up on a surgical table with sinister laughter ringing in their ears. \nWarfarin felt she had done nothing wrong, and even Dr. Kal'tsit couldn't convince her, leading to several of Warfarin's more outlandish behaviors being banned by the company. \nShe has since cleaned up her act, but still occasionally 'scars' an Operator, making it hard for them to trust or respect her. \nIn the end, she still doesn't think she's done anything wrong.",

Some accounts say that Kollam's enemies suffered a weight several times that of their normal weapons when facing him in battle, finding themselves physically and mentally defeated. If they were lucky enough to survive, they were often maimed. But some referred to Kollam as an enlightened despot, saying that cuts from his blade drew no blood, and anyone wise enough to retreat would survive. \nHowever, some ancient texts claim that Kollam's saber was destroyed in battle before he even succeeded to the throne, and that the weapon he later wielded was a fragile illusion born of his Arts. Such claims are inconsistent with Kollam's subsequent performance in Sarkaz conflicts, and few can explain why Kollam would not recast his favorite sword under those circumstances. I speculate that Kollam did have the power to shape weapons with Arts, and this theory is centered on the throne. But that Kollam rarely used his Arts in that way, having once been an adventurer. \nOf course, it is written that after Kollam's ascension, his saber gave off a greenish light, like a breath of flame. Kollam's famous ferocity led to the blade being dubbed 'Wrathful Cerulean Flame.' \nMost of the Sarkaz legends have been lost in the ongoing ruination of Kazdel, which has tremendously impeded historical research. There have been recent calls from Sarkaz scholars to restore their history, but their own research has been poisoned by propagandistic efforts to paint a noble picture of the Sarkaz race. \n\n--Logos",

The reason these long, thin threads are called 'creatures' is because they possess the intelligence and mobility of a pet trained to follow orders, greatly adding to Deepcolor's combat flexibility. After comparisons to the 'Meeboos' created by Mayer of the Rijn Life Research Center, these creatures are actually mechanical entities defying any existing classification. They have spindly bodies without noses, mouths, or ears. \nAccording to Deepcolor's own reports, these creatures were captured by her father somewhere in faraway Sargon as a gift to her.

Diverse individuals with all personality types can fill the halls, and there's no distinguishing rank among them.

However, her infection disrupted her future plans. Today, Gloria is still unable to recall how she got infected (it is worth noting her sessions all alluded to an alternate personality, 'Nightmare,' and it seemed only 'Nightmare' could recall how it happened). Temporary memory loss is a common symptom of Oripathy, so all investigations should take that into account.\nAccording to our intel, Gloria had at least six months of combat experience before joining Rhodes Island.

However, she is hesitant to trust a capable, powerful organization like Rhodes Island. \nThis is because she believes she has to resolve her own issues. \nIn our long conversation, I promised to her on behalf of the Doctor (and if the Doctor doesn't like this, well, it's for the greater good!) that if an unknown peril hit Rhodes Island that we could not resist, we would give her up. \nI came to two conclusions:\n1. There is a secret organization to which Skadi has close ties. Not only is this organization hostile, it is violent. \n2. This organization goes far beyond just Skadi herself. From her description, I think they experimented on Skadi. Or they could be trying to entice her, little by little. Another possibility is they can't control her right now and don't want to deal with her until they've crushed her spirit. \n\nSkadi also hoped she could find something that would prevent future tragedy. \nDoes that sound antisocial? Wandering alone is a heavy burden to bear... \nSigh, she became a wanderer because she was trying to escape, and also showing some rebellion. \n\nI think... \nI think the Doctor should be in charge of Skadi. Isn't taking care of an Operator's needs necessary to build trust?\nOh, Kal'tsit will disagree with me. If she finds out I'm the one who said all this, she'll probably hang me from the bridge for everyone to see.\n\n--■■■",

We'll work out the specific dosage, but enough for two hundred people should do, right? \nThen, when Skadi gets woozy, she will be taken to the nearest infirmary... And we've got her! \nDissecting her would be a bit too much, but we only need a little more information to add to what Dr. Kal'tsit already has... That's it! \nEven if it's just a blood sample!

This kidnapping was the big thing in that campaign. \nThe kidnappers were really something. They had serious firepower, enough to wipe out all our detectives. If we screwed up, they would've killed the hostage and all our effort would've been for nothing. \nThe hostage's grandfather was a tough old man who seemed to be Victorian nobility. I think the kidnappers had some reason to go after this kid and it wasn't ransom. They wanted their story to be streamed to the public so Wei Yenwu would look weak. They weren't just ordinary kidnappers. It wasn't that simple. \nThe rescue mission was planned by Wei Yenwu and this kid's grandfather. They used a secret special ops team. It's beside the point, but that team was the prototype for the Guard Department's Special Inspection Unit. There were a lot of tabloids and novels written about them. \nAnyway, they pulled it off. The ringleader was executed and most of his accomplices were killed on the spot. \nThe hostage? She was just a little girl. The kidnappers clearly didn't think about how traumatic the experience would be for her. \nShe didn't end up seeing anything gruesome. She saw a Lungmen police officer rushing out. She saw the heavy Christmas snowfall. She saw the street lamps and the Christmas tree outside the abandoned building. That's pretty good. \nI hope the officers left a good impression on her. \nHow do I know all this? Some old police officers told me about it.

It's also common for a mountain of paperwork to disappear one day only for her to get called into an urgent meeting when she is about to go see a movie. \nShe is mechanically efficient.

These medical students all embraced the same dreams, confronted the same challenges, and worked towards the future together. With everyone's help and encouragement, Sussurro managed to press on through the long, dull days in her time as a medical student.\nThough Sussurro originally had no aspirations of her own, through making friends with all kinds of people, she gradually came to understand the reasoning behind their choices. Whether it was to secure a job with a stable salary and life environment, out of a genuine desire to help others, or just out of pure interest in biology, Sussurro found their aspirations infectious.

At this point we still have no evidence to support a direct or indirect connection, but we speculate that the emergence of these originium Arts that appear to be linked to the celestial bodies will further convince the common people of these beliefs. Were it not for these techniques, most people would likely return to the scientific explanations for originium Arts, turning away from astrology.\nBack to Astesia, she has reported that she feels her own abilities are weakening. Our observations show that contracting Oripathy has had an effect on the originium Arts she already possessed. These effects will persist for quite some time, but we cannot say what the outcome will be, and whether it will be good or bad for Astesia. We need more time for observation and research.

In recent years, there have been many such independent cities that have surrendered to neighboring nations.\nHowever, Siesta's special characteristics may be able to take them in a new direction.",

In fact, the discipline of Originium Research has a large number of sub-categories, both in the applied area of the doctrine as well as the theoretical. Ceylon specializes in researching the history of applied development of Originium. \nBefore the modern academics managed to specialize the research, many precious historical materials on Originium were not well preserved. In fact, collecting clues from past historical data to infer the paths of development of the various Originium schools was also an important part of modern Originium research.\nAlthough today, with the development of science and technology, the study of historical materials has gradually become less concerned with the development of theory and more the verification of it. Of course, the importance of recording history itself is self-evident for the meaning of a civilization.\nNaturally, although Ceylon has only just graduated from university, her intellectual reserves and enthusiasm for the study of Originium is breath-taking, and one can clearly see how much effort Ceylon put into her studies. For Rhodes Island, the addition of such an outstanding talent is a most unexpected surprise.",

Schwarz can independently carry out her tasks as well as hit the taverns with other mercenary operators and engage in hand-to-hand combat with them in the practice area.\nThey both have their own independent lives, and after joining Rhodes Island, they expanded their horizons even more. We can intuit that they will become more accustomed to this life while still remaining as important to one another as they've always been.\nThis could be described as a 'profound mutual affection,' with emphasis put on 'profound.'",

However, these methods often come at considerable cost to herself.\nPerhaps Schwarz does not have as much experience in dealing with monsters as other operators do, but she is uniquely capable among Rhodes Island operators at dealing with human and humanoid foes. In the words of one operator, 'She is like a machine designed specifically to ruthlessly kill humans.'\nHowever, in the presence of Ceylon, she may still be cold, but she betrays a softer side. Her relationship with Ceylon is less a simple master-servant relationship, and more of a relationship between sisters on equal-footing. She dotes heavily upon her younger sister and will satisfy any of her requests, no matter how unreasonable. She shows tolerance even for her most whimsical notions, and her normally cold voice possesses a certain pampering tone.\nIt is only in these moments that she appears to transform from a machine to a person, in the eyes of spectators.

However, during the event, she chose to stand on the other side. Though she was forgiven, this has still ultimately been taken as a betrayal, and has caused a chain reaction of events.\nIn the analysis of the incident, we can see that the real reason she took the other side was because that she has an inclination toward the city's Mayor, Herman. It is true that she deeply loves Ceylon, but she is not just her puppet. Theoretically, as the mayor's agent, she ought to be the one who understands him the most. Her quote, 'When it's time to shed blood, do not send Lady Ceylon to do it, send someone who lives amongst the shadows,' is likely an accurate representation of her mentality on this.\nDespite bearing witness to the event, after joining Rhodes Island, Ceylon has still shown some idealistic tendencies. This is normal. She witnessed some of the cruelty that this world is capable of, but the relatively neat resolution to this incident has lightened some of the shock of it. Moreover, not everyone needs to have a deep understanding of this so-called cruel reality.\nHowever, this brings us to the salient point of this discussion: What position should Rhodes Island take on this issue?\nPeople like Ceylon are not a minority in Rhodes Island. Rhodes Island is not purely a research institution and thus our nature determines that we will sometimes come face-to-face with unsavory situations. Do we have an obligation or necessity to expose these members to cruelties they've never experienced before? Or is it enough to abide by Schwarz's quote and 'Send someone who lives amongst the shadows?'\nThis is a topic worth discussing in more detail.\n——Archivist R.F.",

Actually, aside from giving you a detailed description of the bushes and shrubs I hid in, there isn't much I can tell you. Wait, and then attack - it really is that simple.\nI was born into a family of Rim Billiton merchants. Both of my parents were traders. When I was six years old, they were involved in a deal in which they were tricked into collecting a number of Originium Stones disguised as ordinary gems. I was infected with Oripathy when I stole some of these stones to play with them.\nAfter my parents found out, they went to confront those who had tricked them, but were ambushed and killed en route. I was treated like a slave and sold. In the end, I was selected by a mercenary unit to become their newest member.\nIn addition to carrying out war operations, this mercenary unit was also responsible for carrying out tasks for important men, mostly their dirty work. After I passed their training, I became a child assassin. After several missions, my organization was tasked with staging some accidents' in a certain city.\nThat is where my fate changed.\nMy task was to assassinate Lady Ceylon's father, but in the process of getting close to him, he subdued me. You can't even imagine. He was a... Forget it, I won't even bring it up. In short, I helped him eliminate my entire mercenary unit. Afterward, I became part-housekeeper, part-bodyguard. That year, Lady Ceylon was three years old, and I was 12.\nActually, what Lady Ceylon doesn't know is that during those years I was a bodyguard, I also helped her father with other matters... Don't get me wrong, I was willing to. The person I care about most is Lady Ceylon but the person I respect the most was her father. That still hasn't changed after all this time.\n......That day, he called me back to Siesta and told me that he found my enemies. Before I set out, he asked me 'Are you sure you want to go? You can live a good life here, Schwarz.' Ultimately, I went, but not just for revenge, but also to make a clean break. Also, I knew that somebody was waiting for me.'\n——This story was related by the Doctor personally.

For it is only those who have experienced the darkness that understand just how deeply that coldness runs.\nThe only thing worth celebrating is that she recognizes this.\nOnly in this way, perhaps what she says will come true.

Part of this hatred is derived from his desire to protect the clinic, and the other part is due to reasons unknown.\nThough Hellagur is by no means a defeatist, he still has taken a hardline attitude toward operations in the Ursus area.\nHowever, when analyzing the military power of Ursus, he has said 'No political entity should come into direct conflict with Ursus. Even if its corruption and fanaticism will eventually destroy it, it's still the most fearsome force in the land.'\nFrom this point of view it could be said that as an infected himself, Hellagur's opinions on many matters are far more critical than those of other infected.\nAll strategically-minded operators have their own thoughts on the situation, and they're all well aware of Rhodes Island's true circumstances in it. Hellagur's relationship with Ursus may make a small number of operators distrustful. But operators who attended the strategic meetings all understand Hellagur's true intentions.\n\nBut Hellagur's words contain no contradictions. He believes that as an infected, he is already on Ursus's opposing side -- \n\n'However, once Ursus looks at you, you will know the difference between being an enemy of Ursus, and Ursus regarding you as one.'",

His friend was the commander of the enemy army, the target of his mission, and was identified as a core figure in the enemy army by Ursus. \nThe second trauma was when a terrible battle broke out between him and the person he trusted the most. After the battle, he was still standing, but the fate of the other person is unknown, as if he died in some unknown alley somewhere.\n\nThe first time, his friend entrusted him with a blade called 'Kudarikiri,' and a young infected girl named Neon.\nThe second time, the person he trusted left him a black market clinic called 'Azazel,' as well as a conviction.\n\nHellagur knew his friend had plotted Ursus's defeat, but Hellagur would not blame him.\nHellagur knew that the child he trusted had instigated the entire betrayal and injured all of the infected in the clinic, but Hellagur would not hate this child.\n\nHe often refers to himself as a warrior. Perhaps this is because he doesn't know how to face everything Ursus has done to him.\nMaybe a little bit of hope is the only motivation he has to keep on living.'\n\nAlthough these conclusions unavoidably contain some of the opinions of the individual who collected this intelligence, we still trust in her ability to organize clues.\nOur response to the incident depends on the decision itself, but at the very least, we may already understand the reason why the General often merely sighs at Miss Neon's improper behavior.",

He earned a major reputation during the Tenth Urcha War. An Ursus soldier with these kinds of achievements is rare indeed.\nDuring the Bloodpeak Campaign, he established a glowing military record but then vanished without a trace. There is only one high-ranking Ursus commander that meets these conditions.\nAs for how I made the inference, well, it's just a guess! Over several decades, Ursus has executed over a hundred commanders. The few left alive can be counted on one hand. Consult a registry of names to get the answer!\nIn the past, both Kal'tsit and I would have been opposed to this cooperation. But these are different times. Even■■■■feels that the situation is getting quite thorny.\nKal'tsit believes that after the Chernobog Incident, the Ursus authorities will carry out a frantic counter-attack and that this should be handled through the Ursus infected community.\nMy thinking is a bit simpler. Azazel is buried so deeply that if Rhodes Island dug them out, Ursus wouldn't have much of an opinion on it. Anyway, they're not too familiar with them.\nThe more cards we have to play, the better, and it's not about who plays their cards first. Warfarin also really wants to get her hands on Azazel's technology. Just look at it as me trying to do someone a favor, all right?\nHowever, the Doctor absolutely refuses to let me see Hellagur's writings! Damn it. What's wrong with taking a peek? I'm not going to forget this!\n\nBut what exactly is the General thinking about? Or who exactly is still supporting him?\nSince the Bloodpeak Campaign, the nobility and the new politicians have been using this opportunity to eliminate military forces. Hellagur has been very lucky to survive judgment. Of course, this may be the benefit of his never having participated in politics, but think about this: neither the army nor the politicians will be content with the current situation. They'll both have the next step planned.\nHe'll never divulge much about Azazel. Maybe its secrets are as terrifying as his experiences. Kal'tsit knows that Hellagur isn't Azazel's main leader.\nThis isn't over. His experience, his country, the things he cares about will all drag him down eventually. When the time comes, it may not be up to us whether we can lend him a hand or not.\n——■■■",

When the brass had had enough of her stubbornness, they gave her a promotion, sending her to manage a squad of fresh recruits. She trained the kids, with great frustration, and they in turn changed her disposition. In time, she grew to accept the soldiers as her own. For the sake of their training, she traded her dual electric swords for the sword and shield combo she uses today. She put her heart and soul into her men, right up until the point when the brass decided to send them on a suicide mission. Dur-nar was beside herself. She flew into a rage and assaulted a suprior officer. She has been unwilling to discuss the events that followed. According to certain documents we've acquired, she was forcibly discharged. She then went through a period of hopping from security to police to mercenary work for short stints, up until she arrived at Rhodes Island. When the Doctor asked her in private why she had come to join Rhodes Island, she produced a letter. It was a letter of thanks from the few survivors of her squad of trainees. At the end of the letter, the Doctor fixated on a particular sentence, 'If there were a place where the command actually cared about the grunts, would you give it a try?' After that was an address to send her resume to Rhodes Island, along with all the names of the survivors.\n\n'And that's why I'm here.'",

What am I supposed to do when the enemy figures it out?!'\nHowever, when a certain female Savra operator made the request, Ethan thought for a moment before putting the full power of his Originium Arts on display for us. \nWe need not go into the details. \nIn reality, not much thought needs to be put into Operator Ethan: the activation conditions for the full power of his Arts are quite demanding, and very difficult to study. \nAt present, the Casters theorize that Ethan's Originium Arts have a passive ability to perceive the differences between metals, minerals, plant and other materials, and then quickly adapt his body pigmentation to the color of the target environment. \nNaturally, rapid changes of color within a short period of time left a sort of chromatic aberration against the background environment, causing a blurring effect.

During the last round of personnel transfers, Magallan received new orders and she began preparing to move her base of operations to Rhodes Island. \nPrior to arriving at Rhodes Island, Magallan's resupply was largely handled by experienced couriers, thanks mostly to security concerns. As such, she is familiar with a number of logistics firms.

While no one can understand her choices, the motivation for Magallan's constant exploration stems from her love for the pursuit of knowledge and the persistence to chase her dreams.\nRhine Labs opened their doors to her, and after submitting her application, she chose the codename that she still uses today: 'Magallan.'",

Indeed, it is true that the Notarial Hall comprises one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, and the executors attest to an important fact: Laterano takes its responsibility to its citizens very seriously, treating it as a binding contract. \nBut the Laterano people's adherance to the law, or even fear of it, goes behind an executor's power to instill. \nI speak not of the power of religion. The political entities founded on deeply held beliefs go beyond Laterano alone, and the uniqueness of their citizenry cannot be attributed to piety or self-discipline alone. \nThis is also not to say that executors, including Executor, are not themselves strong. Last week, I saw him tear out the aorta of a vicious beast with his bare hands, spraying his partner with blood. That was not the first time an operator came crying to me that 'Executor is terrifying,' and it certainly won't be the last. \nBut for the hands of its few lawyers, executors, wandering judges, and the Pope himself, Laterano can do little more than proclaim that the law must be followed. \nIn addition to its temporal statutes, Laterano must have another, higher order of law that we cannot perceive. Rather than saying the executor is one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, it would be more appropriate to say that the executor is the physical manifestation that Laterano created to befit the name of the law. At least that's my opinion. \n\nAll I want to know is what Executor meant by 'the statute that takes effect once a shot is fired.' Given what he said, I have to wonder if this 'law' might be some kind of Originium Art. \nThis is the first time I have ever seen Kal'tsit at a loss for words. She appeared to have something to say, but turns and left with a cold laugh. The whole time we were discussing Laterano law, she kept a hand over her mouth and an eyebrow raised. It was really odd. \nI hope my curiosity hasn't gotten us in trouble. \n\n--Caster Operator L.A.O.",

This past month has been stellar, and I think we've all earned a nice meal. On me, as always! \nNow then, I have something to discuss, pertaining to the exchange agreement between Lungmen and Rhodes Island. The first round of applicant review falls on us. We do very important work here! \nEven those of you most familiar with Rhodes Island's regulations will sometimes get confused by some wording or something, right? I know there's one line, hm, it's pretty long in the original, but paraphrased—— \n'Should an operator fail to meet the needs of Rhodes Island, regardless of motivation or action, they are ineligible for onboarding. Conversely, should an operator appear with an origin or background subject to some scrutiny, as long as they meet our needs and strictly abide by our rules, they remain eligible...' \nSomething like that! The original text is very dry and very long, so I won't go over it all right now. \nDoes anyone feel the need to ask 'why?' Let me provide a simple example. \n\nSay there is some remarkable individual who comes highly recommended, with a remarkable set of personal ideals. In order to see their ideals realized, they sacrificed many people, destroyed entire cities, and ultimately succeeded. \nNo matter how great this individual or their ideals, Rhodes Island cannot accept them. We would be nothing but a platform for such a person. \nThen we have another individual, who has their share of problems. The things they do and the ways they do them may seem a bit unreasonable to us. This person submits a resume to Rhodes Island.—— \nSit down! I know you're all eager to say 'we already have a lot of operators like that!' And there are indeed some! \nThink for a minute how many things happen each and every day in the many cities of the world. Can we settle them all ourselves? \nWhen an operator subjectively plans an action that would harm Rhodes Island's ideas, that operator is immediately expelled. When an operator intentionally violates Rhodes Island's rules and regulations, that operator may be eliminated before they can cause material harm. \nEven if! Even if the regulations are as they are, Rhodes Island has never once done such a thing, we have never seen such an action. Oh, not counting private wire connections. You can blame Closure for those! \nThe adjudication of whether or not an operator is eligible is dependent on his will, not his rap sheet. \nRhodes Island has the ability to observe and study its operators while also maintaining its rules and regulations. At Rhodes Island, some operators are at last able to achieve what they'd always hoped to do. \nAs long as we maintain contact with them, we will respect their choices, within reason, and never force them to act against their own will. \nSometimes, when there remains no other choice, such a thing may come to pass. \nI hope everyone understands this, just as they understand the Infected, and Rhodes Island's mission statement. \n\nFor all candidates, the most important thing is to find them their place at Rhodes Island, and to acknowledge Rhodes Island. \nWe must adhere to this in processing the applicants under this exchange agreement. Understood? \nAh, of course, the Waai Fu girl we just approved is perfectly fine. \n'——When one is committed to constant reflection and tempering of his ideals, we are willing to serve as his forge. The bumps in this road, whether mine or yours... We will cross them together with our operators.' \nI hope you all appreciate this quote from Theresa. \n\n ——Record of ■■■'s lunch meeting.",

In fact, this biological tissue spontaneously ignites because it cannot withstand such vigorous cellular activity, which depends on nothing of the flames themselves.\nSimply put, in the first stage, all tissue she contacts is rapidly activated. In the second stage, said tissue uncontrollably metabolizes, and in the third stage, it explodes with enormous energy.\nIf you claim that all her Arts necessarily cause fire, then fine, give me another three months, and I might be able to figure out the underlying mechanism.

I hope that everyone had an opportunity to preview the introduction last night.\nThe lions all claimed to be king, as the Dracos and Aslans each received equal opportunities. Under the terms of this ancient treaty, they were both qualified to become the sole monarch of Victoria. The Dracos symbolized unquenchable thirst for conquest, while the Aslans symbolized power through order. People believed that for countless generations, Victoria was influenced by three forces, including those two.\nLet's not even talk about how many bloody uprisings have been caused by the succession of the throne... Ever since ancient times, people have known that Victoria is not a friendly country capable of handling its own affairs internally. The Aslans originated in Sargon, Leithanien, and even some other countries that have since been wiped out by Catastrophes. The Dracos, who were in power, had no reason to peacefully accept a group of outsiders, let alone allow them to rule their country.\nThe treaty that formed between the Aslans and Dracos could not have arisen in a stable and civilized environment. The most harrowing aspects of this history have been made light of, woven into a prologue for the legends that would follow. In this regard, the oral tradition preserved through gypsy bards and poets can be more reliable than 'official sources.'\nHowever, there are always fragments of truth embedded within legends and tall tales.\nThough a modern state, Victoria has paradoxically sustained its ancient tradition of rule. As early as two decades ago, the Draco bloodline was considered to have been severed, leaving none to threaten the Aslan's firm rule over Victoria.\nWhat happened afterwards was covered in the second class session last month.\n\nHowever, the status quo of Victoria is not the focus of this lecture. What I would like everyone to consider is this: 'Granted that the contract between the Dracos and Aslans was engraved somewhere even more conspicuous than the throne itself, what would happen if there was still a Draco alive out there that could challenge the Aslan rule?'\nNations that had been dissolved, ethnic groups which had been assimilated, civilizations that had been conquered... they all are waiting for a new banner.\nHowever, one must still consider that depending on the nature of the leader, the ideology that takes root - and the subsequent strength of the movement that it grows into - can be quite different.\n\nNevertheless, I still wish to remind everyone that this so-called 'history' is happening around us right now, and the trajectory of the future may not be entirely determined by the origins of the ones who decided to set things into motion.\nAfter all...\nHmm? Look at the time... that about concludes things for today's lecture. For next week's class, I'd like everyone to turn to page 14, and familiarize yourself with the life of a typical Draco king and see how his image in history differs from how it is presented in legend. Then, we will discuss the reasons for these differences.\n\nYou had a question, Miss Istina?\nAh, of course. History is the cause of current events. As for my personal interests...\nWhen the Reunion Movement publicly announced its existence to a small number of political entities, most policymakers decided to respond to the threat of a show of power from the Infected with force; and a small number of them were so concerned that just the appearance of a Reunion leader would trigger an immediate response.\nCombined with the fact that Rhodes Island has secretly received some new patients recently, I am looking forward to a day when these lions will no longer rear their heads. After two fulminating red dragons suddenly emerged from the heir of the lost Draco clans, Victoria may once again be cast into a storm of unrest.\n\n\nHmm, if the testimony is true... there might even be three.'\n\n—Recording of Rhodes Island Lecture No. 43, History of the Empire, Lecturer Hypatia",

Her Arts is very restrictive in terms of the types of materials and receptors that can be acted upon. \nNevertheless, through continuous testing and training, she has honed her Arts in a way that greatly eclipses the complexity and efficacy of the original mode of use.\nWhether using the rise of hot air as a buffer, using the rapid expansion of air around her to generate thrust, or by supercompressing a specific amount of air to create a temperature differential capable of causing a small-scale explosion, Blaze has thoroughly understood how to utilize her Arts.\nShe is also capable of using her own blood to enhance the effect of her Originium Arts, with a greater usage of blood corresponding to a greater increase in efficacy.\nThough sometimes mistaken for a Caster, all illusions of such are quickly dispelled when she approaches them with her heated chainsaw.\n\n\n'Look, what the hell did they decide to write here?

Among the Operators who struggle on the front lines, Blaze is considered as one of the most dedicated.\nNevertheless, regardless of whether the missions she was deployed to all happened to require such firepower, or because Dr. Kal'tsit deployed her specifically knowing her capacities, most of the missions that Blaze participates in are worth solving using these rather... unrestrained methods.\nLiterally, by erasing the source of the conflict, whether it's a dispute over Originium, ownership of a building, criminal activity, etc., there won't be any conflict remaining.\nThis doesn't mean that Blaze will, like some Operators, cause trouble for her fellow Operators or even be forced to act independently. Her ability to work as part of a team is also one-of-a-kind. In fact, a team with her as the main attacker can safely focus on supporting, defending, and completing other mission objectives, because Blaze can single-handed absorb all the combat pressure for them.\nWould any team refuse a proposition like that?\nAs a matter of fact, yes. Quite a few, actually.

She too disappeared after leaving her daughter behind. Her mental condition seemed to be extremely distressed as she left Rhodes Island. Though a messenger was later sent to try to get in contact with her, our efforts were akin to chasing a ghost.\nGreyThroat, at the time she first arrived at Rhodes Island, had a series of worrisome issues, most notably her resentment towards Originium and Oripathy. She didn't even try to hide her hate towards the Infected. At first, the Operator entrusted with taking care of her did not take her mental state to be a serious issue, given that she was still young and might be overwhelmed by her experiences. However, I must admit that the seeds of GreyThroat's subsequent problematic development, as well as the many conflicts she would later cause, were planted during this time long ago. \n\n(Note: The radical words used in the original file involving discrimination and hate have been redacted, and the Doctor may only refer to this file.)",

During this time, GreyThroat remained isolated, trying to avoid contact with the various personnel within Rhodes Island. Someone once witnessed GreyThroat scraping at her own arm with a piece of industrial sandpaper, and was not discovered by staff until her arm had been turned into a bloody mess. The reason was because GreyThroat accidentally touched some Originium-based devices.\nWhile GreyThroat has not taken any radical behavior towards Infected persons, her actions have been a source of discontentment among many younger operators. The ostracized GreyThroat of course takes no issue with this fact, and continues to lead a relatively solitary life in Rhodes Island.\nThe only exception is Amiya, one of the few people she is willing to communicate with. Perhaps due to being separated from her family at a young age, her desire to speak with a peer for support sometimes even eclipses her prejudices. However, even when she is in the same room with Amiya, she carefully maintains her distance, exhibiting mild PTSD at the very beginning. At Amiya's suggestion, and in return for adoption into Rhodes Island, GreyThroat began training for the Operator assessment and learned to use bows and crossbows. Some were skeptical, claiming that it was just an excuse for GreyThroat to leave Rhodes Island, or even try to defect, but Amiya quickly put a halt to this, as well as other unfounded rumors.",

Even those who are vocally opposed to her conduct cannot deny her combat performance. On the battlefield, GreyThroat is far keener than Operators who have served for a similar length of time, her excellent dynamic vision compensating for her lack of marksmanship experience.\nHowever, can a Rhodes Island Operator shoulder her duties while being so hostile and disgusted towards the Infected? In order to address the concerns of others, Amiya personally took the initiative to put GreyThroat on her operation team, and successfully carried out several missions.\nSome people may be hard to change, but many hoped that Amiya would be able to gradually influence this somewhat abrasive girl. But, reality would once again surprise everyone. After a long and harrowing rescue mission, GreyThroat changed dramatically overnight. She began to learn to talk to the Infected, though she still would often touch upon topics that are typically off-limits for the Infected. Her tone was cold, and sometimes even full of barbs, but her frankness began to soften the hearts of many.\nVery few people know about what exactly transpired on that mission, with Amiya and GreyThroat both seldom mentioning it. What is certain, is that GreyThroat is no longer blinded by a myopic hatred. However, is her heart actually free from the shackles of hate? It is not that simple. People who seem to easily let go of a deep-rooted hatred are not trustworthy. After each physical examination following her return for a mission, GreyThroat repeatedly confirms her blood originium-crystal density, accompanied by a near-suffocating fear and subsequent relief, perhaps a reflection of the guilt and ensuing sorrow. GreyThroat still often wakes up with nightmares, and rarely has an opportunity to sleep, whether on a mission or in the Rhodes Island dormitories.\nGreyThroat is still her old self, not like Amiya, not like anyone else. But she will still fight for Rhodes Island, and nobody doubts this anymore.",

Not until I saw my Infected friend, a greasy wrench in hand, vandalizing the street... like a lunatic. Even today, I sometimes still see her expression. What does that mean? I'm not sure.'\n'From then on, I couldn't stay calm when talking to Infected people. Since I probably don't need to hide anything from you, Doctor, I'll be frank. In the worst cases, I felt like vomiting. Amiya is the exception though. I really appreciate her. Oh, but don't tell her I said that.'\n'But, I've also seen the Infected across this world. The hungry woman using her own blood to nourish a ghastly, malnourished child, exiled to the scorched soil of the barrens, or admitted to some 'clinic' in name only to die. With no treatment and no food, they eat the soil at the base of the walls, surrounded by the inorganic, petrified bodies of those whose ridiculous lives have long expired. And what is on the other side of that wall? A peaceful, prosperous mobile city devoid of hunger.'\n'I have seen the exiled Infected rescue travelers, and I have also witnessed traveling doctors who help these Infected crushed by terror. After becoming an Operator, I have also become involved, trying to help those who have not joined a mobile city-state avoid Catastrophes. One incident still is fresh on my mind. One time, in the face of a flood, Infected villagers held back the water with their own flesh, buying just enough time for the evacuation. And so those Infected gave their lives, their bodies now floating on top of the water, but nobody cares. Do you know how the villagers view these heroes? With disgust. Whether they hate these people or the Originium crystals on their skin, I cannot say.'\n'And why is this happening? Amiya told me before, because everyone is a living person. Everyone wants to live, and has the right to survive.'\n'Did you know? When Amiya said these words, she did not look like a young girl at all. But I am not the same as her, and there is inevitably a difference between the Infected and non-Infected. I just want to find the balance between the Infected and the people we were born to be, for those around me, for who I am inside. Nothing more, Doctor.'\n\n --GreyThroat's conversation record with the Doctor after a certain medical examination.

Few words are more appropriate when seeing her in front of the doors of the engineering department.\nNian will engross herself in discussing the similarities and differences between various materials with the engineers, participating in the design and experimentation of new alloys. Once structural issues are involved, she will often stay up with them for several days.\nAt least when she is among engineers, she is shielded from the words she hears far too often, 'unemployed folks sure have it easy.'\nWhen watching Nian debating fiercely with weapon designers over a blueprint, one might speculate that Nian simply is more accustomed to investing in her hobbies rather than pursuing regular work.\nHowever, when she was recommended by a Rhodes Island engineering officer, she refused the job offer.\nIt must be pointed out that Nian treats workers in the metallurgy industry more gently than she treats others. Generally, the only people who enjoy such treatment are the actors in one of the 'independent films' she's trying to produce.\nWhich raises the question, why?",

However, there was nothing playful about the nature of the support she offered to her teammates.\nNobody who sees Nian's fighting style will say that she's playing around. She is a force to be reckoned with upon the battlefield.\nShe never wears armor despite the fact that she serves as a heavy operator, and yet nobody has ever seen her get injured.\nTo explain this, Nian attributes her success to the special equipment she carries around.\nThe equipment functionally flows like water, capable of taking the form of a heavy shield or a strange sword. It is even capable of splitting into shards that can be dispersed across the battlefield, channeling some unknown technique to soften all kinds of blows that would have otherwise rained down upon teammates.\nAlthough Caster Operators have all come to the conclusion that there is little overlap between Nian's abilities and Originium Arts, that information is hardly relevant to her teammates.\nAs long as it works, anyone not just running logistics has little concern for how it works. That's right, even if Nian uses a massive sword to split apart a Metal Crab. Probably.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, engineer operators do not recommend trying to analyze or reverse-engineer Nian's equipment.\n'It's no good, we can't recreate it. It's best just to let her play around with it.'\nNian claimed to be a bit disappointed hearing this.\nOf course, Workshops #3 and #6 have been tirelessly working on it for the last three months, with their experiments incurring a massive amount of wasted resources.

If a situation with Aak truly became unbearable, just report it to Hung, and the situation will soon be resolved. While it cannot be said that Aak fears Hung, Hung unabashedly treats Aak like a little brother; and Aak, despite his usual attitude, probably sees Hung as an older sibling as well.\nThe second is Waai Fu. Though the righteous Waai Fu and the ill-natured Aak would seem totally incompatible, the two have unexpectedly developed a good relationship as members of the same detective agency. Waai Fu believes that Aak is a fundamentally good person, whereas Aak sees Waai Fu as old-fashioned but not impossible to get along with. By the way, if Aak is out looking for trouble, you should call Waai Fu instead of Hung. The ensuing scene is quite entertaining.\nThe third is Warfarin. After learning that the true identity of 'Mr. Blood' was none other than Warfarin, even Aak, who had spurned mainstream medicine, couldn't help but to engage Warfarin in academic discussions on a frequent basis. Admittedly, Warfarin, whose views towards medicine differ slightly from other medics perhaps as a result of her longevity, and Aak, who is a bit of a freak himself, make an unexpectedly good duo. But as a caveat, when these two find out that they share some common interest and tastes, strange laughing and cheering have become far more prevalent than ever before - either from Warfarin's or Aak's lab, now with two voices instead of one.",

Not to mention, he frequently researches and develops medication that seems incomprehensible to the average person, such as pills that make farts smell like watermelon, or make people lose the ability to recognize a certain color.\nOf course, if you knew who his father is, this tendency is no longer so puzzling.\nAak's father used to be a well-known attending physician at the Lungmen Central Hospital and was renowned for his medical ethics. But due to a certain incident, he was framed by others for malpractice, after which his career plummeted and he disappeared from the public eye. The next time he reappeared, he had become a vicious illegal doctor in the underworld of Lungmen's black zone, with even Lungmen's gang bosses trembling at his feet. When this person perished a few years ago in a gang war, the entire Lungmen underworld breathed a collective sigh of relief.\nAak clearly inherited his father's mantle, both the good and the bad. Even as a teenager, he made a reputation for himself in the underworld. Without discipline, he perhaps would have walked down the same path as his father, eventually becoming feared as well. However, after meeting Hung, he joined Lee's Detective Agency, a move that can be considered a turning point in his life.",

Despite Aak's young age, his views towards medicine have already greatly surpassed that of even experienced doctors who have been immersed within the field for years.\nThe reason behind this is simple: because he left the mainstream medical circles, he no longer views medicine solely from the perspective of a pure doctor.\nPure doctors will think about problems within the scope of medical practice, preoccupied with how to better save people, often losing sleep or forgetting to eat in the process of developing new drugs. Most of Rhodes Island's medics fall under this category.\nHowever, Aak is different. He saw the limitation of medicine, and recognized that the existence of medicine was due to harm. Of course, a large proportion of this harm occurs naturally in the form of diseases, but because Aak grew up in the black zone, he saw more of the harm that people inflicted upon each other.\nOver time, he began to scoff at the idea of pure medicine, resenting his colleagues because they only knew how to save people. They would rush to the scene of a conflict, even the most advanced pharmaceuticals utterly powerless to stop the conflict from having broken out in the first place. The more lofty and prideful the medical profession, the more Aak came to hate it.\nOf course, Aak's thoughts are radical and fringe, with his daily behaviors reflecting a bit of his immaturity. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that his ideas are rooted in the bloody reality that shaped his upbringing, and events sometimes unfold in the way he describes. While Rhodes Island does pursue a lofty dream, it also never looks away from reality.\nAfter getting to really know him, several of Rhodes Island's core medic operators set aside their initial disgust towards him and, as his guardian Hung hoped for, decided to show him a better side of this world and provided him with the best possible conditions.\nAfter all, everyone knows that Aak is a genius, and over time, he will surely mature into a phenomenal doctor.",

The greater his medical proficiency, the more he rejects himself; but if he tries to leave medicine behind, he loses his sense of purpose, and thus the vicious cycle continues.\nNo one told him that what he was doing was right, no one told him that it was fine to pursue that path, and nobody wanted to give him a place that would accept him. While it must be said that Lee's Detective Agency prevented his sense of morality from going too far astray, his psychological issue had not been resolved. Of course, this is not to place the blame upon the agency, for psychological problems usually require professional help even to be detected. Moreover, a personality like his also requires the proper environment.\nAnd at Rhodes Island, Aak is recognized and accepted for who he is. Everyone tells him that he is just, and reminds him that he is the best at what he does. As for the crux of the reason he resents medicine, Rhodes Island is already addressing the issue - we never intended to rely solely on pharmaceuticals to solve all the world's problems.

He was then invited to the agency by Mr. Lee when he was suffering from hunger and never again can he leave the business. (Note: This description was from Hung himself)\nRegarding Mr. Lee and Lee's Detective Agency, while it is not suitable to describe the scope of business in detail, here is a brief summary: Lee's Detective Agency only takes investigative cases as a front, while actually accepting just about any type of work. They are known as the 'House of Everything' within Lungmen's gray zone.\nAccording to his description of Mr. Lee, we can conclude that Lee concealed a darker secret from Hung. Though it is obvious that Hung is kind-hearted, he is no pedantic old man. He knows very well that you can't talk things through with everyone, and not every story can have a happy ending.",

That being the case, unless Hung himself makes a request, Rhodes Island will not deliberately arrange them to live together or to work together.\nNevertheless, Hung's worries about his younger brother are evident through his conversations with the Doctor. He wanted Aak to see the kindness in the world, but did not know how to do so himself, and so he chose to stay with him.\nEven though he hasn't realized it yet, despite Aak's somewhat nasty personality, Aak has fundamentally been influenced by Hung.",

As soon as Dobermann concluded her speech, Snowsant immediately shot up and approached Dobermann - nobody had ever seen her move so quickly before.

Though Snowsant quickly seemed to realize her rude behavior, she stood there for a few seconds before shuffling back to her seat, trembling in front of the whole room.\nWe later learned that her purse had a small hole in it, and the purse was filled with coins that she had painstakingly scrounged up. Surprisingly, though Snowsant was fidgeting around for the coin almost the entire meeting, her notes were almost identical to what was given by Dobermann. We hope that the Operators prone to falling asleep during meetings can learn a thing or two from her diligence.\nAlthough sometimes this diligence reaches a level that makes others worried about her health, most Operators watch over her fondly as this frail girl carefully and painstakingly goes about her work.",

There are too many talented people surrounding them, which makes them underestimate their abilities, and they compensate through an almost stubborn work ethic, taking one step at a time.\nHowever, despite understanding each other in many regards and confiding in each other, after learning about Jessica's monthly expenditures on firearms, equipment, and Originium bullets, Snowsant once questioned Jessica's grasp of currency and basic mathematical knowledge. If you see the two eating together at a cafeteria, don't be surprised if you see Snowsant with an empty tray in front of her. While Jessica is certainly capable of helping Snowsant financially, she also knows the value of the sacrifices Snowsant is willing to make for her ideals.

With the exception of the few familiar faces she had met before, there were far too many people waiting to make her acquaintance. Of course, her priority is not so much becoming acquainted with people, but rather becoming acquainted with food. In the place where everyone gathers to eat, there is a certain door. On the other side is a world of countless edibles, waiting for her to sample. She's not particularly subtle in her efforts to sneak in, resulting in a high probability of being found and shown the way out. However, that doesn't seem to deter her - at least until she's tasted the contents of all the bottles and cans there.\nIn light of the fact that Ceobe is still learning about the norms of civilized life, everyone privately agreed to not punish her when she gets caught, and some people even took the opportunity to feed Ceobe some strange things. Though these people usually fall under one of three categories - the experimenters, the kind-hearted, and those who just wanted to make fun of her, Ceobe generally only has two words to say about the things she eats: 'Yummy,' or 'Good.' No one can coax any other words out of Ceobe - naturally, the experimenters can't get the kind of data they're looking for, the kind-hearted pretty much all get the same few responses, and those who try to make fun of Ceobe are undertaking a self-defeating task. Over time, the number of people casually trying to feed Ceobe decreased as well.\nAlthough she has indulged in many foods of all shapes and sizes since coming to Rhodes Island, if asked to pick out the food she loved the most, she would choose honey biscuits. As a matter of fact, honey biscuits are the only thing that she seems to be picky with - currently, she only accepts biscuits baked by Lava, Vulcan, and Matterhorn. She won't touch even a single crumb of the biscuits baked by anyone else - even by the logistics chief.\nSummary: She won't eat, but she absolutely can eat just about everything. She loves honey biscuits. If the day comes where she's in the mood to eat the entirety of Rhodes Island, she'll likely do just that.",

Her curiosity led her to seek the meaning behind the axe, so she stopped to ask a question to the first person she could find - and thus began her life of wandering. Along the way, when she got hungry, she ate wild fruits. When she was thirsty, she drank water from the rivers. Her journeys took her away from most of civilization. Because she didn't have the ability to discern areas that were contaminated with Originium, Ceobe quickly contracted Oripathy, and what she described as 'black crystals' started to appear across some parts of her body. At first, these growths were a source of fear for her, but as she continued to wander, she began to see the power that these crystals had brought her - her weapons had grown stronger. Ceobe's fears were soon replaced with a strong desire to obtain more weapons, an uncontrollable impulse that often drove her to resort to violence to satisfy. Though she tried to suppress these impulses and use peaceful methods to obtain weapons, the outcomes would often differ greatly from her expectations. Sometimes she would rescue others, sometimes she would injure them; Some would reward her with weapons for completing tasks for them, some would use weapons to try to lure her, while others would gift them to her with no strings attached. In any case, her journey took her far to the east, where a well-intentioned person told her that she had taken the wrong way. With her large collection of weapons and tales in tow, she turned around and returned west. Her journey finally came to an end when she attacked a Rhodes Island squad led by Fang while trying to obtain food.\nWhile Ceobe lacked the qualifications to become an Operator, the HR Department finally gave her an opportunity to take the Operator evaluation exam upon Vulcan's recommendation. She had no expectation of becoming an Operator, nor did she know what such a job entailed, but she still demonstrated a great desire to become one. After becoming a fully-fledged member in Rhodes Island, her daily routine of eating, drinking, and fighting, combined with medical treatment of her Oripathy, also alleviated her strange fixation upon collecting weapons. She has grown accustomed to her comfortable lifestyle, and hopes that her time her can last forever if possible...\nAs long as someone can unlock the secret of her axe.",

Because the enchanting process requires a suitable weapon to serve as a carrier, each enchantment will instinctively 'choose' its own weapon and then, in accordance with the quality of the weapon, the enchantment will confer a different Originium Arts characteristic, such as flames, rocks, or ice. In the past, this ability was a subconscious process that she could not control, and therefore she didn't give much thought into it. Now, under the tutelage of Rhodes Island Operators, she is working hard to understand her unique skill: though she may never be able to master the fundamentals of Originium Arts through studying, she must learn enough to operate her skills on a basic level, which would be enough to help her achieve a baseline level of identification and control and strengthen her abilities all around. Today, Rhodes Island has developed a comprehensive learning plan for Ceobe, and as long as she is willing to sit down in a classroom and begin working on her literacy, we have reason to believe that she can become an excellent Arts user in the future.\n'Feel free to dream.' --Anonymous comments",

Many mature schools of Originium Arts share similar methods of inheritance - for example, Leithanians use movements, the Sarkaz lead through ceremonies, and various guilds of Arts practitioners conduct research, all for the purpose of passing down the theoretical and practical components of Originium Arts. As one of the traditional Originium Arts originating from Yan, Lei Fa has a deeper history than most other forms of Arts. As a system shrouded in mysticism, the requirements for practitioners of Lei Fa are also restrictive and physically demanding. Its inheritance system gradually evolved into a solemn ritual of sorts, much like the passage of power. The end result was that Lei Fa tacitly became synonymous with the position of power, subsuming the popular symbol of law enforcement, and even becoming a form of self-cultivation in the quest for spiritual transcendence. As for rumors of the physical basis of 'transcendence,' I can only say that as an Originium Arts researcher outside of Yan's cultural circles... I must harbor a healthy amount of skepticism.\nObviously, Leizi exhibits a degree of pride for the Arts she uses.\nAccording to some officials, when she taps into her powerful Originium Arts, her hair will become very smooth.

The fact that they can focus on their goals and practically ignore all the rest of the background noise is good for their work.\nSome others are concerned, but are just keeping silent about the matter. For example, Ansel brought up the issue several times, but decided against it each time and left after dropping off some snacks. They've struck a good balance between curiosity and their sense of responsibility.\nOr, they simply don't know anything about it. I once witnessed Cuora getting lost and ending up in front of Leizi's dorm, only to have dinner with her before being sent back to Block A. Cuora will recount how they had four main dishes that night as well as a soup, concluding that Leizi is a very nice person, end of story.\nYet another type is those who have already been bound up and silenced, not even uttering a word about the matter even if tortured. Yesterday, I caught Blaze slacking off while I was on duty. Even though this time it was basically just bureaucratic busywork, and Blaze tends to use this time to get some rest and relaxation, she actually ran over to the intelligence room to go over files with the person who complains most often about her work ethic - Leizi. Amiya, who was standing at the doorway, even vouched for them before apologizing to me and pushing me out. She still had that faint smile as she waved me goodbye.\nSome of us are definitely going crazy, and I've begun to suspect that it's actually me. Having that said, this proves that in addition to gathering data, Leizi has a vested interest in 'maintaining amicable relationships with her targets.' While it's true that she hasn't done anything yet, she also has been concealing her whereabouts from the rest of the world.\nAt first, I interpreted her application for long-term board as a form of rhetoric. In that regard, I admit I was in the wrong. It's just that to write this whole thing off as 'improving relationships' is far too suspicious.\nHow ironic. Concealment and deceit have turned into a method of expressing trust, and turning a blind eye in order to coexist together has become the new norm.\nFortunately, the great powers have not turned their gaze upon Rhodes Island just yet, a neglect which has already saved us several times.\nOf course, if she was trying to spy on us, it would be stupid to walk in with an official state-sponsored identity. But that is precisely why we cannot rule out the possibility, and must do our best to maintain confidentiality and control the information going out.\n\nTo be honest, she is very good at her job. A pity that she is not one of our Operators.\nI can actually make some inferences about what happened to her before, and it's entirely understandable why she seems to be in a rather odd state.\nPerhaps now, the only proof of her true self is that tone of voice, and her golden locks that flow like electricity. I believe that she is in a self-imposed exile as a result of this case.\nNo matter where you are, there is a price to be paid for being selfless. If you fully dive into this cause, you will also give up your future. However, now that I think about it, surely the Central Judicial Office has no shortage of such personnel?\n\nI admire her courage and perseverance fleeing here by herself. That would be a reason to shelter her even if she didn't pull her weight.\nThe hardships that she must endure from here on out, and the path that she must take, may yet be unknown to her still. No, I'm sure she knows full well, but simply has chosen not to act upon it.\nSome people believe that those who work in the judiciary have a strong moral compass, and everyone can see that on display. In Leizi's case, she readily apologizes if she is wrong, and never toots her horn when she is right. You will never be able to get someone like her to stop bowing her head. It's a part of who she is.\n\nDespite her many virtues, a glaring blemish is her attitude towards the Infected. By the looks of things, this is not something that can be changed in a short time.\nHowever, just as day and night eventually blend together, I trust that a day will come when she understands the plight of the Infected. After all, she needs our help as well. I heard that Leizi spoke of a certain time in Yan, or a certain season... something involving the spring's first roar of thunder. The spring thunder is supposed to penetrate the darkness of the long winter.\nI'll look after her, provided I don't get pissed off to all hell by those who are keenly interested in her personal belongings, like Haze and Rope.",

Rhodes Island's well-equipped bath facility has quickly become one of her favorite places.\nPurestream holds herself to strict standards in the conservation of resources, her conviction only faltering when it comes to her bathing problem, for which she appears ashamed and apologetic about.\n\nFor others, this is perfectly understandable, for nobody is perfect. Despite that, Purestream has expressed remorse for her actions and has even set up a rule that limits her to three baths a day.\nBecause of this restriction, she makes sure to thoroughly enjoy each session. When she completely submerges herself into the water, the young girl is so happy that she sometimes can't help but to sing.\n\n[Classified Records]\n Regarding Operator Purestream's race, it is difficult to find out where they originated from, but we may be able to glean some clues from some local folk songs.\nHer true hometown must be very far, far away, in a distant land.",

At first glance, her appearance seems to be at odds with the stereotypical imagery of a serious soldier.

              "storyText": "Of course, despite the fact that Miss Bagpipe gives off the impression of a cheery 'girl next door,' the fact remains that she indeed was an official soldier in the Victorian army - and an excellent one at that.\nThe Victorian Royal Guard Academy is multi-directional in its educational framework. Unlike other systems of military training, this academy has its own educational policy: of the three directions, most graduates serve as guards for the royal family, nobles, or various dignitaries. Officers generally serve as senior-level commanders in the army, while sergeants generally serve as the army's field commanders and first responders. As a graduating sergeant, Miss Bagpipe undoubtedly possess exceptional military talent.\nIn fact, there are significant fundamental differences when comparing the training of Operators and soldiers.\nOperator training places more emphasis on individual and squad operations, cultivating along the lines of their aptitudes in order to maximize their strength. As reflected by Rhodes Island's collection of highly individualized personalities, Operators must capitalize on their uniqueness, cooperating to complete various objectives with the fewest number of elite Operators.\nOn the other hand, military training emphasizes the collective. The development of a corps is comprehensive, stressing the importance of standardization and interchangeability. The military tends to make decisions based upon overall functionality rather than upon individuals in order to ensure the stability and efficiency of the team.\nDue to this need for comprehensive training, a soldier's combat capabilities must be higher than that of an average qualified Operator. Nevertheless, these two roles scarcely warrant a comparison, because an Operator's job should not be applicable to war - this is something that is to be avoided as much as possible.\nAs a result, Miss Bagpipe is unable to directly become a role model for the other Operators when it comes to developing combat abilities. This was evident early on when Dobermann, Liskar, and Nearl, all professional soldiers, joined Rhodes Island. Though they quickly adapted to their new environment, their military training posed many striking contradictions with Rhodes Island's combat principles.\nHowever, Bagpipe, who passed the military training examination with perfect marks and served in the front lines on the battlefield, still is a prime example of what a good soldier in active service looks like. This should be a healthy wake-up call for certain Operators who think they can match the caliber of professional soldiers, or simply have no idea how the military works.\nThough the projectile function has been removed from her piledriver spear, the weapon itself is still a terrifying ordnance of war. Do not let your curiosity get the better of you - or your life.\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that whether due to her natural open-mindedness or due to Victoria's exceptional educational system worthy of its name, Miss Bagpipe did not require retraining when transitioning from a soldier to an Operator, adapting quickly to the new position.\nAs an Operator, she demonstrated the resilience and discipline of a soldier; as a soldier, she exhibited the flexibility and fluidity of an Operator. This has led to Dobermann commenting in private: 'Victoria's superiority over other countries... starts from the professionalism of their military.'",

As everyone knows, Vouivre women tend to be very strong.\nSince she was a child, she helped her family with farming and animal husbandry. After joining Rhodes Island, she brought those valuable experiences over to the logistics personnel in charge of related matters. Her enthusiasm in these subjects even made some think that she was transferred to the logistics department.\nFurthermore, she is familiar with large-scale agricultural equipment. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, Rhodes Island's agricultural projects only allow for the use of small tractors, much to her dismay. After all, we can't simply hand over the entire ship to her. \nOf course, none of this means that Miss Bagpipe has no knowledge of modern life - she tried it, but failed. This is somewhat evident from her relatively frequent maintenance applications compared to the other Operators.\nAlso, according to her, she tried to learn how to apply makeup from her upper-crust classmates as a student, but the results were hopelessly embarrassing. She gradually gave up on developing herself in these areas, but she of course is still self-conscious about her appearance... Though she is impeccably dressed as a soldier, she seems to be rather anxious about her casual dress and appearance.\nBut those concerns are hardly warranted.

Victoria, as the most prosperous empire in Terra, is inseparable from its vast military might. As a sergeant, Bagpipe can also enjoy better treatment than regular foot soldiers, and that's not even factoring in her personal abilities... If she wished to pave a path from her role as an excellent officer to becoming a noble in the big city, there would be nothing in her way\nHowever, she rejected that path. Bagpipe chose to leave the army and her comrades-in-arms, even leaving Victoria behind to roam the dangerous land.\nHer decision to leave civilization and step out into the wilderness is a choice that ordinary city-state dwellers cannot comprehend. After all, leaving the security of civilization is practically a death wish. Bagpipe endured her arduous journey, traveling with Messengers, cooperating with mercenaries, catching whatever rides she could and accepting what little hospitality was available. Due to her identity and nationality, she was forcefully kicked out of some cities, drew the hatred of many, and even got pulled into dangerous conspiracies. According to her, 'I've seen it all.'\n\nNow, she has arrived at Rhodes Island. The friendly Rhodes Island Operators were willing to join her in her struggles, extending a hand of assistance to this seasoned soldier. However, that was the moment her steps faltered.\nThe more she comes to understand Rhodes Island, the more confused she becomes. After going through a series of tests and information exchanges, she became agitated and unhappy upon learning of Reed's presence.\nWhat is it that is weighing down upon her mind? What kind of problem exists that could not be solved by Victoria's military? What happened in Victoria, and what did she and her regiment encounter?\n\n'I used to be a soldier of Victoria. This doesn't seem... to be a responsibility of Rhodes Island. Although I'm no longer in the army, I'm sorry. I... I still am responsible for this. This is part of our duty, and also why we left.'\nMaybe it's not the right time yet.\nMorever, even though everyone looks up to her as a model soldier, the Bagpipe who toils hard in the fields, the Bagpipe who carries three saucepans over to the table, the Bagpipe who sings and spins while wearing a long skirt, the Bagpipe who regales us with dazzling tales of her hometown...\nEveryone loves that side of her too.",

Beyond the obvious, however, it is important to note that modifying Originium firearms is extremely dangerous. From the fact that his modifications allow those who cannot use Originium Arts to operate such weaponry, one can surmise that Sesa must have made many unfathomable breakthroughs in his craftsmanship. His name soon became a mainstay in the black markets due to his reputation for excellent craftsmanship. Surprisingly, Sesa's own talent for Originium Arts is not enough for him to easily master the use of Originium equipment. In fact, he struggles to operate even the most basic of Originium weapons. For this somewhat famous weapon modifier, the reality seems a bit hard to believe as well, and this is perhaps the reason for the modifications he's made upon his own grenade launcher.\nLater, when we investigated the laboratory incident, we found that Sesa's late brother, as the leader of the military laboratory, was far more proficient in Originium Arts than Sesa.\nThis may be the reason why Sesa has gone through such painstaking efforts, tapping into a far greater talent so that he too may be able to pick up a grenade launcher.",

We found it difficult to believe that such an accident could take place in one of Columbia's most prestigious military laboratories. With this bit of skepticism in mind, we uncovered the greatest doubt of this whole incident: the fact that it was an illegal experiment.\nIn reality, the military giant that Sesa and his brother worked for did not focus on Originium firearms that can only be used by a select few, as the versatility and lethality of such weapons generally fell short of just applying Originium Arts to traditional crossbows.\nThough the most crucial information can only be understood by Columbian military and government officials, according to some contacts, we have every reason to believe that the project the two brothers pursued is the same one that Sesa has mastered - eliminate the high barrier of entry of using Originium firearms. This can also explain why the company has not faced any backlash from either the government or the private sector despite such a major accident. The person in charge of the ill-fated experiment has even risen through the ranks, becoming a point of resistance that even Rhodes Island cannot continue to investigate. \nIt must be noted that even though Sesa's work has been described with awe on the black market, all he can do is enhance existing weaponry. Though Sesa might come closer to it than most people, the idea of 'letting anyone pick up an Originium firearm even without being able to use Arts' is inherently not feasible and not allowed. Originium-based technology might still have its limitations, but if certain people throughout Terra catch wind of these developments and attempt to use this technology to escalate geopolitical conflicts, there is no telling what kind of brutal, all-consuming wars we may face in the future.\n'The power I deliver is growing closer to the real deal, and it is both dangerous and eye-catching... So, uh, that's why it's absolutely necessary to keep this technology under wraps!' He explained it himself.\nBut if this is true, is it possible that the person responsible for the accident that buried Sesa's brother... Sesa himself? Despite attempts to verify this, Rhodes Island has no right to pry into a subject that he seeks to avoid.",

Based upon available historical records, there are few mentions of those called 'Conviction,' but one can clearly conclude that this name does not refer to any specific single person. In history books, descriptions of Conviction's race are not consistent, with the earliest records stating Conviction as from Minos. Despite these discrepancies, these records are all similar without exception in describing Conviction as beautiful in appearance, good at dancing, harboring a strong sense of justice, generally being skilled at a special type of boxing, and proficient with arts.\nUnlike normal boxing techniques, Conviction's special technique weaves in Originium Arts. Often referred to as 'Conviction Punch' in records, this special combat style is characterized by footwork akin to dance steps. According to the depiction on a mural, this is a type of assassination technique designed to strike in an unexpected way. Some of the attacks within this technique, when first launched, may appear to just be dance moves to observers. However, bystanders may also get hurt in the process.\nThe most details about Conviction in the historical record are said to come from a number of chapters from a certain story, and this is considered to be the most reliable known source despite slight discrepancies in the details.\n\nFrom 'The Way of Arts - Apocrypha of Conflict':\nOn the first year of the modern epoch, a group of artists established the ancient kingdom of 'Agamem.'\nAmong the artists of Agamem, a group of them rose to become the ruling class and in a bid to seize all the country's property, announced a national ban on the creation of high-end art and declared the tomato as the country's sole staple food.\nThe artists of the country soon were forced into a miserable existence, trying to sell inferior works of art in order to put tomatoes on the table.\nOne day, an artist stood up to challenge the unjust rule. On the first day of April, the artist convicted the seven rulers with a series of superb punches. As a result, Agamem was able to enjoy a long period of peace, and flourished as a paradise for artists.\n\n'Agamem? Super Artist Wars? Only eating tomatoes? What a load of rubbish. Why not focus on the birth and life of Conviction? Does the person who wrote this book bear some ill will against Conviction's peerless power? If it was up to me, information other than the Conviction and Art won't be included! Quick, find the person who wrote this book! I shall convict them!'",

However, there is no indication that anything resembling a 'train' or train-related technology existed in ancient Agamem, but the records clearly state that 'trains' did in fact exist. This sheds some doubt upon the authenticity of the origins of the 'train dilemma.'\nThere is also a variant of the train dilemma involving trolleys, but electric trolleys were invented even later than trains were...\n\n'Conviction's Justice': \nWhen Conviction brought judgment upon Agamem, seven criminals were seized for suppressing the development of art.\nIn order to punish them, Conviction tied six of them on the train tracks of an Durin train.\nThe last was posed an impossible problem, doomed to ponder this question forever while eating nothing but tomatoes.\nTo commemorate the artist who stood up in the face of injustice, the people of Agamem named this person 'Conviction,' and the problem was named the 'train dilemma.'\nAs a caution to future generations, people reminded themselves to exercise their arts and to never be picky eaters, lest they too be posed with the terrifying train dilemma.\n\n'300 Philosophy Study Exercises': \nConviction brought 7 convicted artists to a railroad that split off into a forked junction; five of the convicted artists are tied to one side of the tracks, while one was tied to the other track.\nAt this time, a Durin train is headed towards the junction and is about to run over the side where 5 convicted artists are tied down.\nThe last of the 7 convicted artists is not tied down, and there is a lever next to him. If he pulls the lever, the train will change course, only running over one person.\nConsidering the above situation, if you are the last convicted artist, should you pull the lever? (50 points available)\n\n'What's wrong with eating tomatoes every day? I'd gladly do that anyway. The rest of you aren't down for that? Forget about becoming Conviction, you're not even good enough to be an ordinary artist. Now that's the true crime. Oh, that's right! I know a great way to help you find enlightenment - you just have to lie down on those tracks over there!'\n'The train needs a Durin to operate, right? Wait, are you seriously asking why this matters? That's part of the art. Art, you understand? The kind of person operating the train, the brand of the train, what material the tracks are made of, the rope used to tie these people, and how many people are tied down to each rail - these all factor into the equation. Each of these small details determine whether or not the train rises to the standard of a dilemma - is that how you really see it? Well, don't blame me for what happens next! Take this, the second Conviction!'",

The number of techniques in 'Conviction Punch' corresponds to the number of people who were sentenced by Conviction.\n'Abridged History of Dance':\nAgamem's Way of the Righteous Fist shall be passed down forever.\n\n'Legends of Righteousness - The Conviction Saga':\nIn many folk tales, Conviction did not directly deliver sentences because the convicted party may have been innocent. As a result, Conviction would issue the train dilemma to test the party in question. Conviction would praise those who passed the test on having great talent in the arts, and encourage them to persevere in their pursuit of art until their works entered the annals of classics.\nIt is said that at first, artists that weren't main stream were outcasted; but over time, these artists rose to fame as talented judges of virtue. These are all related to Conviction.\nCertain medical reports exist suggesting that only eating tomatoes for an extended period of time leads to nutritional imbalances.\n\n'Who dares classify my Conviction Punch as a dance? And what is this about nutritional imbalances? Do I look scrawny to you? Hmph! Hmph! I bet you can't even follow my fist! An ordinary Operator's gonna get sent flying if they eat one of these! Wait, why are you trying to change the topic? If you can't answer my dilemma, that's fine, nothing to get ashamed about.'\n'Right, there's nothing to be ashamed about, because I'll convict you on the spot! If once doesn't do the trick, then I'll do it again until I beat the sin right out of you! We'll see what breaks first, your foolishness, or my revolutionary crime-busting skills!\n'Eat this!

Prolonged exposure to this Originium-dense environment unknowingly awakened Originium Arts within the young girl, and prolonged contact through potable water, food, wound sites, etc., further exacerbated her rampant and uncontrollable Arts. After learning about this situation, Miss Shamare was quickly transferred to the Rhodes Island landship for medical treatment and management.

In addition, Shamare also demonstrates interests that are incomprehensible to others, frequently talking to herself using antiquated jargon. At first, Medics thought this was possibly a symptom of contracting Oripathy at such a young age. Later on, when visiting the attendants who were responsible for taking care of Shamare, we found that many of them did not blindly heed the myths and rumors, and even after becoming aware of the various possibilities, still chose to regard Shamare with malice and ill will. While most of them have expressed regret for these sentiments, the truth is that every time they would leave the island, they would quietly plead with the ferrymen to take them away. When they got into town, they were often viewed as accomplices to some horrific crime even though they were merely shopping, a testimony to the unfair treatment they would receive. Understandably, no amount of good intentions can offset the withering bombardment of negativity. \nOver time, the townspeople who didn't know the truth came to establish the dominant narrative, and even the attendants who had stayed with the young girl for many years started to view her in the same light. Overall, it can be said that the effect of the environment and her upbringing played a far greater role in the development of Shamare's character than Oripathy itself.",

Gradually, some of the younger Operators began to wonder if the supernatural phenomena that frequently occurred around Shamare actually had some credence... Although our current understanding of Originium is not enough to explain all the secrets of Terra, it is nevertheless highly undesirable to simply categorize the unknown as 'curses.' We hope that all Operators will try their best to remain sensible and approach Miss Shamare with a normal mindset, as this too provides valuable guidance to her education. We should all think rationally about the 'supernatural events' happening around Shamare, and believe that there are naturalistic explanations for these phenomena...\nAddendum: So far, no one has fully elucidated Shamare or the mystery of her Originium Arts. Yet nevertheless... all we can do is believe that these are indeed due to Originium Arts.

At first, we thought that her references to 'divinations' and 'curses' were coping mechanisms to deal with her environment over time or perhaps due to the fact that her Arts subconsciously harmed others in the area, resulting in her attributing everything to the work of evil spirits in order to understand what was happening around her. \nBut based upon Shamare's performance in some missions, as well as bits of data gathered from Originium Arts tests, we were all surprised to find that Shamare's Originium Arts do far more than strongly influence the consciousness of others. Notably, she borrows the spells of 'Morte' to inflict observable physical damage to enemies. Are mental suggestions strong enough to cause deviations in a target's brain function, enough so to cause rupture and hemorrhaging? Although this hypothesis is quite tantalizing, it is fundamentally a fantasy from the perspective of modern Originium Arts technological research. Even more strikingly, her predictions and divinations are sometimes surprisingly accurate. For example, the last time we secretly replaced the Originium fiber filling inside Morte with ordinary cotton, she very unhappily divined the misfortunes that would befall a number of us. Some of these predictions included taking a fall from a chair breaking, getting hit by an unknown passing-by Sankta, and getting lacerated by broken test tube fragments - all of which came true! There's a bruise on my head, you say? Hm? And this is because we're supposedly already affected by her spiritual suggestions...? \nThat... can't be right, can it? Ahem... We've got to have a bit more trust in our patients, don't we! Even if Shamare can't fully control her powers at times, there's no way she'd be able to influence the entire research team without our notice, right? At least the recorder should be able to remain objective about this! \nMore importantly, whose dumb idea was it to give her a doll with that weird Originium stuffing anyway? Don't you know it's dangerous to give Originium-based products to Shamare? ...I approved it? Seriously... I did?",

In the past, she always wanted to go far away from Corinia to see different facets of life, but after some time as a mercenary, she realized she would never be able to flee from Corinia, the heart of Minosian trade as well as her splendid motherland. However, her struggle was not fruitless - in her line of work, she came across two other nomadic city-states that rivaled her home: Athenus, the spiritual garden of Minos, and Lakedaímōn, the sacred ground of warriors. In these places, she was able to encounter different philosophies as well as different ways of life, and at the same time, it was in these places that the vast world beyond Minos was revealed to her.

As long as the task can be successfully completed, she cared not for the experience, or lack thereof, of the person carrying out the task. By the time Sideroca officially joined Rhodes Island, she had an impressive track record of zero tasks failed, even completing tasks that allowed the mercenaries to abandon their goods in order to ensure their own safety. Of course, her accomplishments also came at a price, perhaps evident by the extra scars across her body. After several years of cooperation, the head of Rhodes Island's Minos branch decided to grandfather her into the main organization - after all, she didn't want this trusty talent to be snatched up by competitors.

While this is beneficial to completing the task, it can also be unsuitable for employers who wish to conceal information from their mercenary hires. The head of Rhodes Island's Minos branch once gave her the following advice: 'Only take on short-term contracts, or stick with one employer until retirement.' She understands that Sideroca's cold personality cannot conceal her inner dedication and work ethic. By working under the right employer, it is possible to achieve twice the outcome with half the effort, but once... because of this very reason, when she learned that the Minos Foreign Trade Union was attempting to strike a long-term deal with Sideroca, she went directly to Sideroca to snag her up before she could sign that contract. When representatives from the Trade Union arrived at Sideroca's temporary residence, she had already left Minos to start a new life at Rhodes Island.

You're the only one with that authorization here, so I'm counting on you.' \n'Good point, let me take a look.' \n\nFast Forward→\n\n'Did you find it?' \n'It's Sideroca.' \n'Side-who? That mercenary? Do they train mercenaries for caregiving duties these days?' \n'She's probably an exception... I heard that she learned to cook in order to persuade the Doctor to work out. All it took was her borrowing a Leithanian cookbook from the library.' \n'How good could something that came off a cookbook be?' \n'You've never tried it, have you? The other day, Gummy and I went to try one of her simple meals. Gummy was blown away.' \n'What?!' \n'That woman's a monster, I'm telling you. I've been cooking for ten years, and even my own mother won't touch my food...'\n'I heard that she selects her ingredients in accordance to nutritional theory while accounting for individual tastes. The Doctor, who swore to never set foot in the gym, was seen there the next day after trying one of her meals.' \n'So that's where that 'Doctor at the Gym' post came from...'\n'Mhm...' \n'This person... is she really just a mercenary?' \n'Beats me.' \n\n——Cafeteria monitoring camera, unknown time",

              "storyText": "Perhaps because she had never received prior formal training, Sideroca still clearly remembers her experiences training to become an Operator. At the time, Instructor Dobermann also has very 'vivid' memories of Sideroca. She says that while it is normal for people to proactively improve themselves during Hell Week, it is inexplicable that someone would ever want to put themselves through Hell Week ever again. In her eyes, Sideroca is the kind of person who can incorporate a brutal regimen like Hell Week as part of their own regular fitness routine, even with already excellent qualities. Because Sideroca kept signing up again and again, Dobermann put her foot down and no longer allowed Sideroca to take the same courses as fresh recruits - after all, that would only serve to intimidate them. Consequently, Dobermann put together a specialized regimen, delving into new training manuals, standard army training, and special operations training and incorporating them to meet Sideroca's needs. She even made an agreement with Dur-nar afterwards, gaining her support in exchange for compromises in some other areas, in order to work together against this person who constantly made the life of the instructors that much harder. Eventually, they discovered that only two things could tear Sideroca away from this almost self-destructive urge to train - going out on missions, or diverting her attention onto the Doctor. Thus, after they deliberately 'leaked' some information about the Doctor's recent malady, Sideroca poured all her energy and enthusiasm into taking care of the Doctor. Even with all of that, however, the reserve operators frequently see Sideroca laboring away on the training grounds.",

All the residences, facilities, and public spaces have been preserved as is, including the troupe's tents stationed in the park, just like in the records - the only thing that's missing are the residents. \n\nThe live video of the troupe's performance has been completely destroyed, and the machinery left behind is broken beyond repair. However, we did locate a main console far from the stage, where we managed to recover some damaged documents and externally backed-up data. \nDespite our painstaking efforts to restore the damaged data, the contents are just a jumbled mess. The best way to describe it is as if a piece of cake was sealed within a plastic bag, then thrown into a fervent crowd at an Iberian festival. What we managed to recover is pretty similar to whatever would be left in that bag afterwards. As for the portion of the data that was sent out, the path was too vague and could not be tracked. \n\nIn order to verify the content, we played a portion of the video footage that could be considered somewhat intact. While doing so, three of the investigators present experienced degrees of psychological disturbance, so we were forced to temporarily seal off the remaining files. \nWhat exactly happened back then? And who exactly would want to preserve such a scene, and why? \nI dare not entertain the possibilities in my head, for they would be inconceivable. \n\n[Video File - Encrypted]\n[Encrypter - Kal'tsit]\n[Danger Level - 3]\n'■■■stage, death■■■■behind■■■loop, song■■, ■■■■end, all■begin.'",

Scientists have found that by combining biological theory with the experience of engineering, they are in a better position to solve various problems encountered in the fields of biology and medicine. This new discipline quickly became closely linked to the practice of medicine. \nEspecially for a company like Rhodes Island that seeks to develop drugs to inhibit and treat Oripathy, a bioengineering laboratory can be said to be a necessity. \nHowever, even if Rhodes Island offers a favorable salary compared to the rest of the industry, it is well-known as a pharmaceutical company that specializes in Originium research and Oripathy treatment. Naturally, these are subjects that would discourage most people. \nBut even setting this point aside, the fact that Rhodes Island needs to be mobile, and the existence of tech companies such as Rhine Lab that can provide a better baseline, has caused Rhodes Island to be at a disadvantage when competing for talent. \nFurthermore, Rhodes Island is not purely a pharmaceutical company, and many prospective employees decide to leave after learning about Rhodes Island's true purpose. \nAll in all, despite the considerable successes of Closure's Engineering Department in attracting a vast amount of talent, Rhodes Island's recruiting efforts are far from enough to meet the scope of the challenges. Closure can often be heard complaining about these difficulties, but she knows that there is little that can be done to improve the situation. \nDespite these conditions, there is, according to Closure, one department that she never has to worry about, and that is the Bioengineering Department led by Weedy.",

Setting aside the complicated relationship between Laterano and Ægir, Iberia is a land full of flair and friendly to scientific research, although this friendship is conditional. \nA tacit understanding exists within the scientific community that one is free to conduct whatever research they choose within certain fields; and undeniably, Iberia has made substantial achievements in these fields. However, some fields of research are completely forbidden; or perhaps more accurately, in Iberia, those fields of research do not exist. \nTo do justice to the modern history behind this situation would require an entire encyclopedia's worth of writing, so I will omit that here. However, bioengineering does exist in Iberia, or Weedy would not have been able to become an expert in the field at such a young age. Naturally, this was a result of her continuing her family's research. \nAdmittedly, the above description makes it sound as if Weedy is seeking asylum in Rhodes Island to escape persecution, but this is actually a necessary background explanation based upon existing intelligence. \nWeedy joined Rhodes Island simply because she no longer wanted to stay in Iberia, and wished to see more of the world. According to her own account, there were virtually no barriers to her leaving, but she was also told that it would be significantly more difficult to return to Iberia - to which she had no particular sentiments. She received an offer from Rhodes Island shortly before receiving an offer from Rhine Lab. \nWeedy is not shy about mentioning her belief that Rhine Lab is better suited to her work than Rhodes Island is, but whenever this topic is brought up, she will tack on the phrase, 'but I think Rhodes Island is pretty good too.'\nOf course it is. Otherwise, she wouldn't have chosen to set foot upon the battlefield either.",

Even now, there are no shortage of scientists who specialize in studying the Infected, but with the intention of proving through various means that they are of inferior birth or even deserving of death. \nEven in Rhodes Island, there are a number of researchers who only recently overcame their fear of the Infected, and still have not reached a point where they can address those individuals with kindness. \nIf this is true even among scientists who are supposed to represent the bleeding edge of knowledge, what are we to think about the beliefs of ordinary people?

The team gained notoriety for its frequent raids on commercial Laterano convoys, and many of its members have claimed their guns as trophies. These guns, often awarded as part of a formal ceremony, fetch a very high price at the Scar Market, Kazdel's infamous black market. W herself still has a number of these guns in her collection, but it was marked as contraband and confiscated following her onboarding in order to avoid arousing the ire of our Laterano operators. Among the many weapons she uses is an explosives-launching device with obvious signs of modification. As for its provenance... after thorough consideration, we decided to not investigate the matter further. \nFollowing the conclusion of the war, W accepted an offer from Talulah to fight for Reunion as a mercenary, thus becoming one of Reunion's accomplices. Subsequently, W unilaterally broke off her cooperation with Reunion and reached an agreement with Rhodes Island that continues to this day. From the above, we most likely have no way of determining W's specific role during the Kazdel Civil War, her motivation in joining and then quickly betraying Reunion, or her purpose in cooperating with Rhodes Island. We know nothing about her history from the onset of the Kazdel Civil War to the time she joined Reunion. Considering that W is still a mercenary, and also factoring in what she did during the incident with Reunion, we urge all ordinary operators to keep their distance from W as much as possible, and also urge all departments to exercise caution when dealing with these dangerous collaborators. \n[Classified Log]\nYou want an ordinary operator to keep tabs on W? Isn't that asking too much? They'd lack critical information. But since we're old acquaintances, why not let me take care of it? \nFine, fine. We should be thankful W rarely needs to stay aboard the landship. Everyone hates her as much as they fear her, but how could things be that simple? What I'm asking is: how complicated could she be? If you know what she used to be, you should know how to get along with these lunatics. Her skills are the real deal - otherwise, how would she have been able to pull all her mercenaries from Talulah? But don't worry, even if she dared pull something on us, Dr. Kal'tsit would see right through it. \nStill, we should definitely keep our distance from her. Especially for our adorable operators who don't get how the world works. W could really upset them. As for our elite operators... I worry that equal parts conflict and alcohol could spark an explosion that ends up destroying half of the ship, if not all of it. I hope that never happens. I'm serious. \nFinally, please remember that as members of the HR Department, we would never recruit an unstable person into the ranks of Rhodes Island. That's the most important condition for employment, after all. So the possibilities are twofold - first, the situation is dangerous enough to demand such measures, or second... we've always known the truth. Or it could be a bit of both. Wouldn't you agree? \n—■■■",

              "storyText": "Sarkaz mercenaries. Up until the final days of Kazdel's Civil War, mercenaries were the most common armed forces seen in Kazdel's barren lands. Each of them worked in small teams, sometimes being recruited by nobles with vast funds and supplies, other times forming spontaneous coalitions with other mercenary teams. In Kazdel, where allegiances shift like the sands and various groups frequently find themselves at each others' throats, the concepts of life and death take on a different form than compared to any other region. For the soldiers mired in conflicts across the regions, becoming mercenaries has become an increasingly popular option. In the history of modern warfare, the topic of 'Sarkaz mercenaries' has always been a subject of intense debate. Some Sarkaz mercenaries were sponsored by someone outside of Kazdel who was both well-equipped and skilled in local strategic configurations, an alarming arrangement that posed a security challenge to all parties. As a result, professional forces dedicated to counteracting the Sarkaz mercenaries have been formed, though specific details are not yet available. \nAfter the incumbent regent clashed with the orthodox royal family to spark the civil war, the remnants of Kazdel's army which had been scattered among various nobles began to gradually unite with civilian forces, eventually being split into factions. The fighting was brutal and harrowing, but some scholars believed that the Civil War allowed a new process of redistribution and restructuring to take root in the barren and chaotic Kazdel. Although the heirs of the orthodox royal family were expelled from Kazdel, they were still supported by various ancient clans and noble families who pitched their massive economic power into unifying a large number of mercenaries, effectively gathering these scattered warriors under a king's banner. This event is considered to be the official start of the mercenaries' prominent role in the Civil War. Shortly afterwards, the regent's side returned fire and did the same. As a result, most mercenaries were brought under one of these major banners, which to some extent eroded the original meaning of the term, 'mercenary.' Despite this, there still remain a small number of mercenaries who are unwilling to get shackled down to this unsurvivable conflagration, and still struggle to maintain an independent position between the two main groups. They believe that mercenaries, or rather, Sarkaz as a whole, should be free. Their deeds are widely circulated as legends among the civilians of Kazdel, albeit having been heavily embellished for artistic purposes. \n—'Struggle and Freedom' Chapter 2 - 'Kazdel and the Modern History of Mercenaries,' excerpt. This book came from W's personal belongings, and the author's name is unexpectedly abbreviated to only the letter 'H.' The sentence, 'Sarkaz should be free,' is highlighted in red.",

Even her infrequent sightings on the ship are enough to cause quite an uproar. \nOne need not reiterate W's nasty temperament, and aside from Dr. Kal'tsit and the Doctor, she considers few to be worth her attention. The last time W came back to the ship for debriefing, we almost had a brawl with two elite operators on our hands... the reason? W provoked them, of course. Even when there is no ill intent behind her words, her attitude alone is enough to incite conflict, particularly when it comes to the dead — including the ones she had something to do with! Truly, a Sarkaz who sheds neither blood nor tears! \nOh, right, regarding Amiya. \nAmiya does not seem to know much about W, and W, despite not considering Amiya to be particular noteworthy, will still defer to her. Isn't that strange? We all think so. Despite her grumbling, complaints and tendency to disregard orders and act according to her own judgment, W has complied with Amiya's orders, at least when it comes to reporting results. It's as if... W has high expectations for Amiya, but I don't think that's a good thing. \nOne more thing - I'm not entirely sure if this is just my imagination, and the boss stops my observations—\nBut sometimes, W will stand in front of an empty room, unmoving... as if in a daze. Other times, she'll just watch Amiya while she goes about her daily business. Yeah, just stare. \nWhat in the world could she be thinking? In the likely event that it's something dangerous, we must take precautionary measures. \nImportantly... every time she was observed, she wasn't smiling.",

              "storyText": "[Classified Log]\nDoctor, I'm sure you realized this as well, but there is some relationship between W and Rhodes Island... as well as with your past. \nWhen a Sarkaz like Flamebringer showed up at Rhodes Island, I knew this day would come. Miraculously, from Kazdel to Ursus, then to Lungmen to today, and maybe on into the future, we've continued to move forward, but we still meet the same people we started this journey with - only now, with the far-reaching effects they left behind. And once again, I have to come to terms with the fact that there are things in this life that we can't avoid, or run from. I talked to Ms. Kal'tsit and Amiya, and even brought a bunch of snacks to bribe Closure with - and everyone had a different opinion. \nI begged ■■■ to please let me talk to you, Doctor. Even though you might not recognize me anymore, I feel like I have to talk to you about something. You just have to keep thinking of me... as a Sarkaz boiler worker. \nI wanted to talk about W. I've known W for a long time. Did W mention this to you... while She was still alive? About Her Majesty. Us 'old Operators' swore to never speak of this again, but it's not because we're trying to hide anything from you, Doctor. The reason is simple - none of us are willing to confront that past. Ms. Kal'tsit... also knows about this, of course. Hm? Don't worry, I checked in with her before I came by. There are some things I can't do as thoroughly as she'd like, so I'm just here to have a little chat. \nBack to W - in the beginning, she was a kid, who only knew to follow Her Majesty's orders, and nobody else's. Even among the then-unified Sarkaz, not many people knew about W's existence. What about Amiya, at the time? They wouldn't have met each other by then; after all, she had just enlisted as a mercenary. Unscrupulous, cynical, and flashing that devil-may-care smile. As for me, I was just a boiler worker at the time who had never seen a battlefield— huh? That's right, I built these muscles at work... I just got lucky and beat that elite operator at arm wrestling... I've never been on the battlefield. I don't know how extreme the soldiers thought W was, and I don't know why they thought she was unstable. I've never seen her in a fight, except she came back from a mission, trailing behind Her Majesty, thinking it's not her place to even say hello. The way I see it, she was trying to follow Her Majesty. Following Her ideals, Her light, just like every Sarkaz before. \nBut W isn't that person anymore. There aren't very many people at Rhodes Island who know about W. But most of the people W knew are gone now. She wore her disguise... for too long, and it sank in too deep. She used to have some friends. Yes, even someone like her still needs the help and companionship of friends. They used to all fight alongside us, and though it wasn't for a very long time, if those friends were still here today, they might still be able to lend her a helping hand. Now, I'm thinking there isn't a single person is left who can help her. That's right, nothing we can do. Nothing you or Dr. Kal'tsit can do, and I'd get it if nobody wanted to do this anyway. But we shouldn't take that for granted. \nWe all want to know what W is after, and what her plans are. In her eyes, is Rhodes Island just a flash in the pan, or a brand new future to carry the hopes of the past? That's a very important question, maybe even more important to people still haunted by the past. That includes Amiya, and even Ms. Kal'tsit. It also matters to how W will handle her relationship with Rhodes Island in the coming days, as well as with Amiya, Ms. Kal'tsit, and even you. \nHm? Oh. There's a simple reason I came to see you. You might not remember the past, but the people from your past keep popping up, one by one. Some are trusting, some not so much, and I'm sure you must be having a hard time dealing with them... Haha, too bad I'm just a lowly boiler worker with no place to worry about the Doctor of Rhodes Island. \nMs. Kal'tsit and Amiya may be able to take good care of you, and also keep Rhodes Island in steady, continued operations. But W... is nothing like them. Whether she's coming at you, or the other way around, I just hope both of you can keep calm and don't be hasty. \nI wanted Amiya or Ms. Kal'tsit to tell you this stuff, or at least have it delivered by ■■■. Everyone gave up and let me do it, but truth be told, I'm also pretty nervous. \nI mean, I'm just your typical, run-of-the-mill Sarkaz. I can't do crazy Arts or swing big swords and axes - if anything, I'd just drop them on my feet. The best I can do is to take care of my own work. All I hope... is that Rhodes Island can keep on trucking across the world, safely. \nHm? You have a question for me? Theresa? You... where'd you hear that name? \n... Theresa, huh? \nMaybe it won't be so long before you have to truly face your past.",

She may not have been gifted with great athleticism or combat acumen, but her tenacity coupled with the basic training she had received helped her quickly grow into a qualified operator. However, her lackadaisical attitude towards getting injured during training and exceedingly cavalier lifestyle habits are causes for concern. \nThe medical department's assessment shows that Absinthe's mental health markers are troubling; she views many issues with significant pessimism, and also displays degrees of self-loathing and self-destructive tendencies. This Ursus girl rarely seeks to establish personal agency in her daily life, instead subconsciously trying to help others around her. However, at the same time, she belittles her own actions to the point of even negating whatever results she may have achieved, a behavior that, in the eyes of the medic operators, is very concerning. \nAnother important issue to bring up is the strong concerns raised by the Ursus Student Self-Governing Group. Before joining Rhodes Island, Absinthe knew nothing about the members of the Self-Governing Group, and vice versa. It is unclear why Absinthe now pays so much attention to their activities, and she is unwilling to talk about the matter. These anomalous behaviors may have something to do with her past experiences in Peterheim Middle School. We can surmise that there must be some undiscovered facts regarding the time she spent there. \nUnder the premise that this status will not cause damage to Rhodes Island, related background investigations have been temporarily suspended out of respect for Operator Absinthe.",

Before Chernobog's residents realized what was going on, much of the city had already been occupied. \nWe can reconstruct an account of what happened in the incident's aftermath based upon oral narratives from survivors. Reunion's leaders partitioned the city and controlled different zones, with certain zones being controlled more strictly than others. In certain places, people could remain unharmed as long as they stayed behind closed doors. But many citizens in other areas were not so lucky... You already know what I mean by that. Certain Reunion leaders encouraged the Infected to 'claim their legitimate rights,' which is a euphemism for allowing gratuitous violence. When an excessively emotional catharsis morphs into hivemind behavior, one can imagine the kind of disaster that would ensue.\nPolice? Compared to the sheer number of Infected who had given in to fanaticism, the amount of peace officers and military police simply was too small. While they were better equipped and trained than the average Reunion rioter, that alone was not sufficient, and the following Catastrophe tore through what little defenses were left in the city. The Chernobog police continued to send backup requests to the garrison during this time, but judging from the results, such attempts were futile. \n\nHow did that girl stay alive in those conditions until the time she was rescued? What kind of things did she have to go through? \nI won't ask her to answer those questions. I can see that she's doing well enough with us, and despite her doubts and anxieties, she's making an effort to understand what happened in the past and shake off the lingering effects of those events. I even saw her trying to make friends, to try to be more inviting and to not push others away. This is no easy feat, and it is also a good sign. There's no way we could heartlessly pry open those wounds. We all need to be more cautious and circumspect when dealing with people who have suffered through disasters.

After that, Rhodes Island operators will escort them to their chosen destinations so that they may start a new life. At the same time, some of the refugees will end up staying with Rhodes Island for a variety of reasons. \nAbsinthe's parents were confirmed to have passed away during the Chernobog incident. When the logistics operator confirmed other kinship ties with Absinthe, the latter rejected the offer to be sent to another city and voluntarily applied to join Rhodes Island. Without a doubt, what she had experienced during the last month had driven her to make this decision. \nThe devastation wrought by Reunion's occupation, the destruction caused by the Catastrophe, and the ugly face of today's complex conflicts - all of these may have well played a role. As the turmoil continued, a shortage of food and drinking water turned these conflicts into something much simpler and more primal. Whether Infected or not, status mattered little when the only thing that remained was a cruel struggle for basic necessities. \n\nThe Medical Department has been closely monitoring the mental health of all survivors of the Chernobog-Lungmen incident. Unlike the members of the Ursus Student Self-Governing Group who also escaped from Chernobog, Absinthe's depression and pain takes on a much more direct manner. She rarely shows a real smile, and very few people are able to approach her. More often then not, Absinthe chooses to stay far away from others and maintain a subdued silence. Nevertheless, Absinthe has already helped many people; she may be taciturn, but she is undoubtedly reliable. Perhaps Absinthe views her own actions as trivial and insignificant, but we believe that kindness begets kindness and eagerly look forward to Absinthe's future development. \nJust like the hair that she cut herself, perhaps only time can heal her scars.",

Yeah, we've been 'ere for a few years, and heard something a couple years back. \nWhat the 'ell's going on with Victoria these days? Us folks have been dealing with Victorians for quite some time now, so we've seen things. Since the mining rush started, we've been seeing caravans carrying some odd gadgets. A few years ago, they suddenly stopped showin' up, and we'd occasionally see people clad in common Victorian clothes collapsin' by the side of the road. Often frail-lookin' women, children, and the elderly too. Y'see, even a well-trained Messenger has to bring enough supplies, and wouldn't dare set out without a vehicle. But you look at these people who can't even get in a caravan, tryin' to cross such a vast expanse outside of any jurisdiction. Who can manage something like that? \nDidn't find out about this 'til later, but apparently one of the boys on our town's mining ship heard from somewhere that a number of years back, before the mining rush really picked up steam, a number of Victorian steam barons came by our mining towns to sign off some limited permits with the trade union. After these barons paid their dues, they extracted some ore, set up their factories when they got back, and made a small fortune. Naturally, power gathered in the hands of these people, and the industry grew bigger an' bigger. Even a few small nomadic cities got built between the route from here to Victoria. But recently, the supply of ore dried up all of a sudden and nobody knew what was goin' on. They sent a handful of prisoners who had been stripped of their rights to a site in Rim Billiton and had 'em illegally snatch up the ore there. Our union here at Rim Billiton had its hands tied for a variety of reasons, and this situation continued until the 'Cage Incident' broke out.\n—Transcript of a conversation at a mining town tavern in Rim Billiton",

Please rest assured, Victorian officials will know to hold their tongues regarding this matter. Or rather, I would infer that someone is currently pulling the strings behind the scenes to hand control of the autonomous county to Rim Billiton in the future. \nYes, and I fear that it is going all too well. The rushed implementation of the new ruling aristocrats' short-sighted policies, the exile of criminalized political opposition, leaked news regarding hostages, the negligence towards the armed forces and domestic defense, and the laissez-faire nature of the Victorian government... have all set the stage for a brewing conflict. \nAmong these cases, an executive official's handling of a political offender's family created a particularly unreasonable hostage situation. Women and children were forced into cages under dilapidated facilities and sent to work in dark mine shafts, never to see the light of day in a way that was tantamount to murder. After news of this abhorrent practice broke, public outrage was inevitable. These new aristocrats, the visionary entrepreneurs who capitalized upon Rim Billiton's mining craze, should never have allowed this to occur, let alone make such a stupid decision... unless the decision itself is part of a much larger transaction. \nRegardless, this is not a problem that can be solved by a former clerk who was reduced to a 'bandit' after being persecuted and jailed for participating in a union protest against their radical pact. But I do have some other ideas, namely about the talent referrals that your company mentioned in the past. \nPresumably your company has done some research beforehand, and it should be clear that in this incident, the kindness and enthusiasm of Rim Billiton's workers played a vital role. Though some may have their suspicions, these virtues are not eclipsed by those who had ulterior motives in mind. I do have a recommendation in fact - his professionalism may have been critical to this incident, and he is praised by many as a hero who dove 'into the cages' in a daring operation to liberate those trapped underground. However, this may not necessarily be a good thing for him. The officials who passed down these barbaric laws were not entirely snuffed out by the angry mobs in the clashes that followed, so I cannot guarantee that there are no survivors out there who still harbor a deep resentment. Although they no longer have any influence over the autonomous county, nor can they seek to ambush the steam power-equipped mining teams of Rim Billiton, it would not be impossible for them to lie in ambush in the outskirts, waiting to attack a lone Catastrophe Messenger who travels with only one bodyguard. In fact, there have been cases of such attacks over the last two years. \nAlthough we tried to persuade this individual to stay within the city and leave the data collection to others, he was even more adamant in requesting missions that would send him away from relative safety. Perhaps he is well aware of our intentions and does not want to run the risk of getting people in the city involved. But does he really have this kind of self-destructive thinking? ...I hope he has a more optimistic outlook. You see, he is the kind of person who is always ready and willing to accept new things, and is never content to languish in the same environment for too long. In any case, entrusting him to you should be the right course of action. Take him - or perhaps, accompany him - to see the vastness of Terra, and more.' \n—Transcript of a conversation at an official residence in the Autonomous County of Eureka",

Though the desire to explore the frozen tundra was her own, the core reason she undertook her exploration had a great deal to do with Rhine Lab. Additionally, Magallan's exploration was better planned and thoroughly measured. \nOn the other hand, Asbestos's exploration is completely amateur - nobody asked her to do it, and nobody is backing her financially. She merely follows her own ideas, walking around and recording her observations in her travel notes and publishing them in magazines. \nIn fact, almost all active explorers on Terra are affiliated with either some country or company, such as Magallan is, and explorers with no backing, such as Asbestos, are very rare. Realistically speaking, a desire to explore the world cannot be fulfilled solely through courage, but requires capital as well. \nThough Asbestos is reluctant to reveal her background, we can surmise that there's likely nothing exceedingly bad or traumatic. As for why she decided to become a maverick explorer, Rhodes Island does not intend to pry too much. That is to say, on this point, she differs greatly from Magallan. \nAs for the differences in their views on exploration, Asbestos claims that she's just 'in it for the excitement.' While it is true that when we mention explorers, we often have an impression of them as being pioneers, trailblazers, delvers into the unknown, or torchbearers for those who come after them, etc., none of these are substantively different. \n'Opening the way for those in the future' is generally the result rather than the cause. For example, while Magallan has always wanted to be an explorer, that desire fundamentally stems from her longing for the frozen tundra. Rather, those who try to act out of one of these clichéd ideals of righteousness usually end up giving up halfway through. \nFrom the footprints that Asbestos has left and the records she has taken, there is no doubt that she is an excellent explorer.",

As a matter of fact, she even revels in that animus, especially when people say it to her face. She understands that the true way to alienate others is not to rudely refuse, but rather to be calculatingly evasive, or to be ambivalent. \nRather than saying she doesn't understand interpersonal relationships, it's more accurate to say that she sees them far too thoroughly and hasn't chosen not to maintain certain norms after recognizing all of this. \nLike Magallan, she knows how to endure loneliness, but a major difference is, one of Magallan's greatest motivating factors is the fact that someone is waiting for her. Asbestos, however, has no need for such motivation, nor is she trying to compensate for that with something else. She simply has learned to draw her motivation from other things. \nIt's little wonder that some operators think she's very cool. She's willing to bear the consequences of her decisions, alone. \nEven though we have no way of finding out about her past without her cooperation, based upon the result, she claims to actively want to be a 'jerk' that antagonizes everyone, and is intent on staying that way until the end of her life. \nIt is not for us to judge whether her lifestyle is correct, nor do we expect her to change.

As long as she is willing, she can happily spend an entire afternoon with someone with even no dance experience, making them feel as if the two are dancing in harmony. She is familiar with most dance styles from both Higashi and Yan, and is very experienced with the ceremonial Kagura dances. However, this is the one type of dance that she refuses to do. According to HR personnel, her reason for this stems from her belief that Kagura dances are antiquated and dull, and only serve to blaspheme the gods while also making the dancers unhappy. Given Tsukinogi's usually gentle words and demeanor, her strong beliefs in this matter are all the more convincing and are perhaps related to her unwillingness to become a shrine maiden.",

As a result of almost universal praise and adoration, Tsukinogi naturally was painted with an aura of benevolence, and was able to establish a vast relationship network. Of course, unlike people who network for the sake of money or benefits, Tsukinogi embraced an altruistic and dedicated approach to dealing with others. This was, after all, the reason she became a Catastrophe Messenger in the first place, and is also the reason why her initial probation period was half the duration of most other operators. The operator who compiled Tsukinogi's file was originally distressed about the fact that the Doctor had been keeping secrets regarding Tsukinogi's past, but after talking with Tsukinogi, that operator has since become a firm supporter. By the looks of things, she is better than most Catastrophe Messengers at earning the trust of others. \nAs for this trust, Tsukinogi credits all of it to the Doctor.",

At least before the Great Rebellion, the aristocratic ruling class still controlled the right to speech. Had it not been for a certain incident, Ursus's political structure might not have shifted at all. \nAccording to Rosa's description, the Rostov family she belonged to was one of the new nobility that arose after the Great Rebellion, inheriting everything from a certain Count that they had served under. \nCount Boris, the mayor of Chernobog, was also one of these upstarts. The two families quickly got on good terms, running businesses throughout Chernobog either openly or in secret.

The date coincided with the time when Mephisto began to move, in the event now known as the Chernobog incident;\nAfter seizing control of the schools, Mephisto did not interfere with the students' actions within the schools, but would not permit them to leave. From the perspective of outside observers, he intended to exacerbate the brewing anxiety of the students. This ugly behavior is consistent with our perception of him;\nThe time Reunion relaxed their control over the schools corresponded with the time Amiya encountered Mephisto during the mission to rescue the Doctor. Amiya believes that Mephisto received information regarding Rhodes Island's movements and left the schools unsupervised because he had already seen what he wanted to see after setting tragedy into motion;\nThe Peterheim Middle School she described does exist in Chernobog, close to the place where they were rescued, in a block not directly struck by the Catastrophe. \netc, etc. \nAfter considering various factors, we can only conclude that what Rosa described indeed occurred within an event as tragic as the Chernobog incident. \nAs for the experiences of the other members of the Self-Governing Group during this tragedy, Rosa said that she didn't know much because she joined the group late, but she also made it clear that she was unwilling to speak on their behalf. Rosa will take the initiative to speak about her experiences. On one hand, this is a manifestation of her trust in Rhodes Island and in the Doctor; but on the other hand, she fears that among the members of the Self-Governing Group, she is the most appropriate person to 'betray' the others and break the silence.

When Rosa joined Rhodes Island along with the other members of the Ursus Student Self-Governing Group, a number of small incidents occurred. \nBecause she was an Ursus noble of pure pedigree. \nWe must confront reality: struggles over politics, economics, land, technology, and war are timeless plagues that have always been tied together by a single thread - nobility. \nAs mentioned in the second file, the old aristocrats largely disappeared from the political arena with the development of nomadic cities; but within Ursus, they did not take their exit from the stage of history. \nOf course, this hardly concerns the average person. It is absolutely impossible for a pure-blooded Ursus aristocrat who has been nurtured at length with an elite education to simply join an organization like Rhodes Island. These nobles sit atop their ivory thrones, governing wealth and land high above the reaches of suffering. \n\nAfter Rosa officially started working with the Logistics Department, she undeniably did act like she was 'trying to seem less like an aristocrat.' One can tell that she is still not accustomed to lowering her position, but she is legitimately trying to adapt to such a life. \nWhy? Because a vast majority of people, Infected or non-Infected, harbor no love for nobles - and particularly not Ursus nobles. \nHowever, Rosa no longer pays any heed to the position she once came from. She bore the burden of contempt in silence, only occasionally smiling and shaking her head - however, she never let that get in the way of her work. \n'No person should be judged because of where they came from,' said Istina as she stood in front of Rosa, shielding her from an outraged Ursus operator. \nWe agree that nothing like that should never be allowed to happen in Rhodes Island, ever. The same is true for Amiya, and the same is true for that operator who later apologized to Rosa. \nRosa, her frankness, her self-reproach, her confusion... was certainly not a novel case when she joined Rhodes Island. \n\nToday is yet another day upon Terra.",

And just like that, Podenco ran into someone by mistake, and landed herself the first job of her life. \nCompared to Perfumer, Podenco still is lacking in many ways. Her sense of smell isn't as sensitive as Perfumer's, nor does she have any knowledge of auxiliary professions, but she is quickly approaching Perfumer's skill with the momentum she has. From a single flower, to a garden, and now to an entire greenhouse, Podenco has the skill to independently manage the Convalescent Garden. In addition, she also began to use the flowers she collected to create a wide variety of reagents, constantly adapting to meet the demands of the various medics in the medical facility.

Suzuran inherited her mother's hair color and facial features, but she also inherited the sacred bloodline of her father, seen through her nine tails.

While he firmly believed that what he did brought succor to the people, he clung onto selfish hopes that his daughter could have a broader, freer future. As such, Suzuran was secretly taken to Siracusa by her mother, but the peaceful times did not last long. Her mother's family was involved in a bout of civil unrest against the ■■■■ family.

She had hired someone to retrofit the unmanned photography drone she keeps around her. Setting aside the cost of the retrofitting and repair, the technician had moved to work in another nomadic city, and the money she had on hand was not enough to support a venture to another city. Without her drone, not only did her planned shooting sessions fell through, but her living expenses over the coming weeks also became a significant issue. In order to earn a living, Click applied to become a video producer for a pharmaceutical, thinking that she'd make some quick money, find the technician, fix her drone, then continue with her online career. \nThe rest is history - she now stays at Rhodes Island. \nThe reason is actually very simple. The people here not only helped repair her drone, but even made a few technical upgrades that she never would've thought about before. Now, the drone is more sensitive, sturdier, and even comes with a small amount of firepower for self-defense purposes. Thus, after renewing her employment contract and adding some filming permission, Click stayed on Rhodes Island and became an operator.",

Fortunately, these depressive bouts rarely last long, and she quickly regains her vitality. \nAt this time, Miss Beeswax made the first important decision since leaving her home to embark on this journey. \nShe decided to become a part of Rhodes Island.",

However, even among the operators who are more concerned about their image, very few will make a conscious effort to focus on their appearance.

This maintenance process usually involves multiple steps such as wiping them down with a fine cloth, applying essential oils, soft brush care, and polish. Beeswax always completes each step meticulously, ensuring that nothing is omitted. Through her persistent effort, her horns have achieved a remarkable state of lustre, shape, and hardness. \nThrough our inquiries with other Caprinae operators, we have established that even by Caprinae standards, Beeswax's horns are magnificent, a rare and beautiful sight to behold. \nAfter finishing her daily care, Beeswax often provides help to operators who need it, making her very popular within certain small circles.",

In Beeswax's tribe, it is not unusual for young members of the tribe to go on journeys to the outside world and bring back what they see. Because these journeys have become traditions in their own rights, this particular tribe is unlike many others in that it does not totally reject novel things from the outside. \nIn addition to these journeys, one or two veteran Messengers may visit each year at certain times to bring the latest news to clan members, including the most recent music magazines. \nBeeswax does not appear to be someone who is incredibly shrewd; rather, she is straightforward and easy to understand. She loves music as well. When she left home, she brought with her a number of magazines issued by the Music Society, and these new publications became quite popular among the Caster teams. Even Beeswax herself quick integrated, smoothly establishing good relationships with the other operators. \nThough Beeswax doesn't talk much, is quiet most of the time, and tends to lose her train of thought, by no means is she simple-minded. In choosing to officially become an Operator of Rhodes Island, Beeswax did not rush to her decision, but had to weigh a variety of considerations. \nThe fact that she chose to stay to wait for her relative, while certainly her primary reason, is only one of several considerations. After a bit of inquiry, we determined that Beeswax believes that her time at Rhodes Island will serve as valuable experience to help her pass her tribe's rites of passage to adulthood— or rather, she sees working with Rhodes Island as one rung of that trial. \nAfter comprehensive deliberation, we also saw no reason to deny the participation of a talented and powerful Caster. On one hand, the addition of Beeswax is beneficial to us. On the other hand, we believe that such an option will help Beeswax as well, and Rhodes Island will be able to provide her with many further opportunities to understand this land. \n\nAs an addendum, the young Caprinae waited for several months before picking out her official code name.

All we know is that she continued to stay there, weaving a masterful tale about the unfolding of a Catastrophe with her camera. \nRegardless of what happened, at least Scene survived. \nAfter Scene contracted Oripathy, her parents consulted several medical organizations and finally decided to send her to Rhodes Island for treatment; however, they've never contacted their daughter since then. In the face of the somewhat complicated political situation in Sargon, this kind of decision seems almost natural to some operators. \nScene herself also doesn't seem to mind. Or if she does, she hasn't told anyone. \nIt didn't take long before she started to apply for the qualifications to work in the field, and even wanted to accompany operators to the battlefield in order to shoot more images. This means that Scene may be involved in battle, and possibly even lose her life. \nBut she didn't let that dissuade her. Lens is very proud to say that the places they've been to have been far worse than what people in Rhodes Island can imagine, and the dangers they've encountered are far more terrifying than what they now are dealing with. \nWhile Scene may have already honed her skills and be able to calmly face the doubts of others, another interpretation is that she might just be very dedicated to her trade. She believes that through her eyes and her lens, she can help others who are more sensitive to images than they are to words, just like her, see more and more of the world. \nScene very rarely says anything, but she did speak once with her dorm mates when discussing her family. She said, she believes in Lens, and deems the robot to be part of her family.\nAlso, she said that she believes in her parents. If her parents didn't love her, they never would've raised her in the way they did—\n'Everything we are born with in life is meaningful, but you are the only one who can discover that meaning. As long as you'll go do it, we will support you.' \nEven though Scene doesn't express it, she may perhaps be very happy now. \nBy the way, how did Closure manage to get a sample of Scene's voice to build Lens's audio library?! \n......\nWhat? Does Scene use Lens to speak for her sometimes? \nHmm, how do I know whether the one talking to me\nis Lens,\nor if it is actually Scene talking? \nIf I had to guess? \nLet's see.......",

Most of the time, Ayerscarpe only needs to accompany him on walks, help carry equipment, or listen to his friend's incessantly prattling about what he thinks is cool — at least until the moment when a crisis comes and he is required to perform his duties.\nThere are many ways for a bodyguard to protect his target. Some people prefer using defensive measures to mitigate the damage, others are good at arranging traps to deter an enemy's attack. However, Ayerscarpe's preferred method of defense is to eradicate the enemies. Though he is a man of few words, his ferocious attacks indeed confirm his status as an operator who believes that the best defense is a good offense.",

However, the operator himself is well-suited for carrying out his duties in this manner. In addition to having excellent combat skills and rapid reaction times, part of this operator's success is owed to the special weapon that he carries. \nThere has been no official name given to this weapon as of yet, and the nicknames that the operator himself has chosen, such as 'my baby,' or 'nice guy,' have no reference value whatsoever. Due to the operating mode of the weapon itself, we've temporarily named it 'RT-01.' \nSince there is no weapon or even weapon class similar to RT-01 within our scope of knowledge, we believe that this is an experimental weapon. According to Ayerscape, this weapon was purchased from Rim Billiton's black market. Rim Billiton has developed many small-scale private mining companies due to its robust mining industry. The turnover and conglomeration rate among these companies are high, which indirectly promotes the black market. Many resources will circulate here before eventually reaching the hands of private individuals, organizations, or even foreign forces. Because Ayerscarpe overcame great difficulties to acquire this weapon, and the weapon itself boasts excellent performance, he is extremely fond of RT-01. When asked to describe any deficiencies, he'll only point out that it 'produces some slight noise from time to time.' \nThe operator in charge of weapon inspections said he didn't hear anything, but Ayerscarpe insists that he hears it loud and clear.",

Leonhardt takes on jobs that require negotiation or involve minerals, and Ayerscarpe takes on tasks that require superior athleticism or uncovering things that can't be discovered by others. Don't be fooled by the fact that he often exchanges harsh words with his old friend — he will never make Leonhardt look bad in front of others, and if something ever happens to him, he is the first to rush over. When Leonhardt became a Catastrophe Messenger, Ayerscarpe volunteered to become Leonhardt's private bodyguard. Since Ayerscarpe acquired his unique set of weapons, it would be more profitable to take on jobs of his own rather than protecting the Catastrophe Messenger, but Ayerscarpe stubbornly insists on remaining his friend's bodyguard, while also making it clear that the other party needs to pay up. All in all, Leonhard, not wealthy in the first place, ended up allocating most of his salary to Ayerscarpe, ending up in an even tighter financial situation as a result. \nAlthough we didn't know how Ayerscarpe controlled these funds before, we were able to investigate the flow of funds between the two after he became an operator, and the results were mind-blowing. \nLeonhardt's concept of managing money is rather laissez-faire. While he is good at making money, he's also good at spending it. After joining Rhodes Island, his shopping list grew longer than ever due to stable living arrangements and a higher salary. Except for work-related tools such as dune buggies, which have questionable usability in general circumstances, Leonhardt's stash of new and interesting things has indeed been growing. Most of these items simply reflect his personal taste, but others are for gifting to young operators who he deems to 'not be cool enough,' and he often offers these gifts in a way that is hard to refuse. Sometimes, his consumption habits have caused been problematic, such as when he couldn't pay the bills one time. This time, he has had Ayerscarpe to cover for him.\nAyerscarpe's lifestyle has always been very frugal. Other than spending money on necessary living expenses and salted edamame, Ayerscarpe has been saving his money, and he basically returns the 'payment' he received from serving as Leonhardt's bodyguard to his friend at the right time. He knows that Leonhardt doesn't know how to save money, and he knows that sooner or later, he wouldn't be able to purchase something that he actually needed. At that time, he'll use that money to buy things for his friend and send it over to him. Even now when there is no direct financial connection between the two, he still often draws from his savings to fill in the gap for Leonhardt. Of course, he also knows that Leonhardt will repay him in due time. This is the mutual understanding formed after many years of cooperation, and demonstrates the trust between the two friends.",

And some of these people will not hesitate to help him when they learn that he is in trouble. This is a good indicator of Chiave's popularity.

Not to mention, Folinic also doesn't touch tobacco or alcohol, doesn't party, only socializes as necessary, and spends the rest of her time in a research lab, clinic, or library to improve herself. Only on weekends does she take a day to satisfy her interests in hunting.

Though she had an interest in hunting and was capable of conducting a hunt in the wild and returning safely, she still had too much to learn as a combat operator. After the Chernobog incident, Folinic made a request to Kal'tsit in hopes that she could make the preparations to transition into a combat operator as quickly as possible, or at least, that Kal'tsit would allow her to join the battlefield as a combat medic or provisional physician. After Folinic took her physical fitness evaluation, Kal'tsit agreed to her request and had Folinic join the reserve operator training camp, where she trained with the other reserve operators. After half a year, Folinic completed her preparatory training and officially joined Rhodes Island's outpost operation team. Folinic considered many ways she could offer her support; she could try to become a sniper, or she could balance her work as a medic and guard; but in the end, she decided to become a combat medic and continue to prioritize medical assistance. However, in her half-year of combat training, she realized that most medics were quite frail and had no combat capabilities once they lost the protection of their comrades. To overcome this, Folinic used her pharmacological knowledge to carefully formulate a number of reagents commonly found in readily-available drugs to treat external injuries. With minor modifications such as increasing the dosage or mixing in different compounds, these drugs could become potent toxins that could incapacitate targets in a very short time. She has stepped out onto the battlefield many times and incapacitated many enemies. We don't know how she feels about her new role as someone who is supposed to do no harm, but when she's facing an enemy, her anger is evident enough to anyone who sees her.",

Her anger and resentment are not directed at individuals, but rather at the vast political entity that is the 'Ursus Empire.' As a Feline living in Ursus, Folinic used to live under abhorrent conditions, so bad that all she could do was pursue a single full meal each day. After she followed her mother to Chernobog due to her job, Folinic naively thought that she was about to enjoy a better life. After all, her life was secure, she had met many people and among them, many were willing to reach out to her or teach her. Kal'tsit was one of those people. Subsequently, she said to her mother on just another ordinary day, 'I'll wait until you're back to cook dinner.' But on that day, everything disappeared - her family and her friends, all gone without a trace. Only Kal'tsit, her mentor and the woman who would effectively become her only relative, rescued her from peril and entrusted her to an ordinary family in Chernobog. From sparse evidence and clues, Folinic pieced together the real cause of her mother's death - Ursus. From that point on, she began to dig deeper, to learn, recognize, understand, and internalize every aspect of what kind of country Ursus is, and each bit of knowledge only further fanned the flames of her anger. Finally, right before Reunion made their move when Folinic was about to finish her studies, she met with Kal'tsit once more and expressed her desire to follow her. Even though Folinic was grateful towards her adoptive parents, she realized that she could never forgive the Ursus Empire to the point where she did not want to spend another second within its confines. Now, if she could call any place home, she would definitely say:\n'My home will always be wherever Dr. Kal'tsit is. '",

For Thorns, others' perceptions of him are ultimately inconsequential, and the way the outside world evaluates him has no effect upon him. \n\nThorns often delves deeply into the extraction and preparation of medicinals and ends up ignoring other things in the process — such as his own outward appearance. Forgetting to wear a jacket, having one trouser leg rolled up, wearing clothes with holes in them, and even wearing things backwards or insides out — all of these are commonplace occurrences. If you encounter Thorns in the hallway displaying one of these features, don't read too much into it. \nFor a swordsman who pursues precision and efficiency, it isn't worthwhile to spend too much time maintaining one's appearance.

This swift and precise technique is widely known throughout Iberia as the 'Destreza.' \nThe mainstay weapons of the Iberian region have always been swords and knives, with a wide variety of techniques spread across the land. However, the technique known as the 'Destreza' is not accessible to everyone. Needless to say, this technique requires excellent physical fitness, but it also has extremely demanding requirements for the user's mind. These strict requirements make the technique very difficult to learn, but if mastered, the rewards are great. \nAt the same time, many traditional Iberian blademasters believe that 'Destreza' can only be used to describe swordsmanship using a standardized subset of weapons; and in their eyes, the styles used by non-Liberis, including Thorns, are nothing but clumsy and blasphemous imitations. However, according to Thorns, those people have absorbed more than enough of the technique's framework and apply them in a more realistic manner. On this basis, there are no issues with considering them as users of 'Destreza.' In other words, people who fight over semantics will quickly perish when they have to actually cross swords. After, they would not be exclusively facing swordsmen. \nHowever, even these renegade swordsmen will readily admit that Iberian swordsmanship is as vast and as dangerous as the ocean. No swordsman may ever exhaust that knowledge within his lifetime; not to mention, that lifetime is generally very short as well. \n\nIn any case, by combining the precise swordsmanship he has mastered with the deadly poisons he concocted himself, Thorns will always complete his missions upon the battlefield with efficiency and ease, ensuring optimal results while keeping losses minimal. \nHis method of operating is beyond reproach in terms of efficiency; however, in many situations, Thorns himself ends up garnering criticism. \nThorns' swordsmanship and his pharmacological knowledge were learned from a local priest. He and several other children studied under the priest, following him through childhood and adolescence. Because this priest became involved in the religious turmoil that would later break out, several of his students have taken divergent paths. \nThorns is exceptionally skilled at swordsmanship, and also exhibits extraordinary talents in pharmacology. He is particularly skilled at extracting and purifying drug compounds, especially toxins. The precise efficacy of some of the neurotoxins he's produced has been praised by the members of the Medical Department. In addition, Thorns always has bolder ideas when it comes to refining other reagents; and while his experiments do sometimes yield positive results, they end with an explosion more often than not. \nEven in the face of failure, Thorns always seems to enjoy himself.",

In regards to the issue of Thorns' interpersonal relationship with other operators, we concluded that there is no need for further monitoring. \n\n[Addendum] \nI agree that long-term observation can enhance our understanding of an operator. \nBut to be honest, I originally thought he was kind of cool, but within a few months, all I could think of was him and his.... uh... how should I put this... lively operators doing all kinds of weird exercises together. They'd talk about wacky topics all day long, and then try to actually build that stuff. Sometimes, their crafts will explode before even being finished! Who's going to be able to keep an eye on a guy like that? How come no one has come to hang these people on deck yet? \n\n[Recorder's Addendum] \nWe already tried that, but it didn't do anything. \nThe investigation period ends today. I have some comments I'd like to write on this file, but my boss said they were too subjective, so nevermind. What I will say is, the potion bang snaps they made today were a lot of fun.",

Occasionally, when you mention their homeland, even Iberians who are generally impassive or stony-faced will show some complex expressions, and these subtle nuances can reveal a lot about their attitudes. \nThorns is one of the few people among us who actually will give an unreserved impression of Iberia. Compared with the silence or vague remarks of the other operators, Thorns actually can give a calm response to our inquiries. He's provided us with a lot of referential information, and while a lot of it is fairly similar to more mainstream conceptions, some of it completely subverts these notions. \nIn the past, this seaside country was often associated with passion, vitality, indulgence, where sunshine melts into the coast along the horizon. Once widely known for the resplendent beauty of its golden sunlight, this country was often discussed in conjunction with Laterano because of its religious connections. However, in recent years, this rich land has gradually become silent and faded from the public eye. \n\n[Classified Log] \nVery little is known about the current state of Iberia. According to Thorns, the treatment of the Ægir in Iberia has gone from bad to worse over the past few decades. He described a once prosperous city as gloomy and stagnant. \nThe local administrators do not seem to prohibit locals from leaving, but they have enacted tight restrictions on re-entry. Rhodes Island's investigators have been staying near the area for a long time, but have not found a way to conduct an in-depth investigation. \nThe Investigation Department has reached a similar assessment, discouraging any attempts to rashly enter the area until the need arises to prepare for an in-depth investigation.",

Particularly the gun she is never seen without. \nWhen she first joined Rhodes Island, her weapon perplexed many of our operators who were familiar with guns— Questions such as: 'She's a Lateranan who looks like an Iberian?' 'Did she rob a Lateranan? Such a badass?' 'Iberians can use guns too?' swirled around endlessly. After all, Blacksteel's guns are assumed to be some kind of corporate secret, but a non-Laterano freelance mercenary strutting around with a huge gun gets people talking. \nOf course, everything becomes clear once you see her shoot an inkball out of that thing. Apparently, it's a modified crossbow made to look like a gun. Because Andreana is a committed firearms enthusiast. \nAccording to her, Laterano culture has had a strong influence on the Iberians, who often display an affection for it. After seeing one of the statues in church as a child, Andreana fell in love with the weapons, and devoted herself to mechanical engineering in hopes of making a crossbow in the style of a gun, since she lacks the affinity for Originium Arts necessary to use a real one herself. \nBut there is a point here worth examining, and one Andreana herself did not realize. She mentioned that she was dragged into court over the weapon several times, only to be chastised when it became clear it was not a real gun. That seems reasonable. But with the limited information we have, the Iberian courts should be very powerful. And for such an organization to grab her 'several times' for something known to be harmless the first time indicates that they may have been using it as a pretense to find something else. \nHowever, since we lack reliable intelligence about the internal politics of a country closed so long to outsiders, we are not able to form any concrete judgments about the situation. And since, at least according to Andreana herself, she has not been harmed or unnecessarily interrogated, we leave the matter to speculation.",

It is said that she learned these skills from an old local policeman. As a student, Aciddrop was report to the police for 'excessive graffiti,' and was chased around three blocks by an old, seemingly-weak policeman. Afterwards, she was subjected to a scolding that was dozens of minutes long. After such incidents 'accidentally occurred several more times,' scolding soon turned into chatter, and the kindhearted old policeman seemed to take pity upon Aciddrop, for her parents were almost never home, leaving her to fend for herself. Intentionally or otherwise, the old policeman let his daughter become friends with Aciddrop, since the two of them were the same age. It is this daughter who first taught Aciddrop how to skate. \n'Of course, the pupil surpassed the teacher, eh?' Miss Aciddrop would happily proclaim.",

Tomimi has little knowledge of life outside her tribe. Her impressions of the outside world come entirely from her conversation with Inam and from the books that were commissioned. When she first came to Rhodes Island, she was the same as two other operators, making a variety of common sense blunders during her trial-and-error phase. However, she quickly completed her transition thanks to her adaptability, and transformed from the leader of a small tribe on the border of Sargon into a Caster Operator with a unique personal flair. \nWhen Tomimi first applied to become an operator, some of the other operators in charge of the testing process initially were opposed to letting her become a Caster. In the eyes of Casters who have been trained under the theoretical framework of modern Originium Arts, Tomimi's use of Originium Arts is brutish and backwards, particularly her preference towards melee combat which runs contrary to what is typically required of Casters. When the testers gathered around to discuss their opinions, one interesting question was front and foremost:\n'What's the difference between her and Gavial?' \n'Gavial wouldn't actually force people.' \n'I think that's only because she's too busy.' \n'But ultimately, they decided to let Tomimi become a Caster, and in terms of her training policy, they did not ask her to conform to the standards of modern Casters and instead allowed her to implement her own fighting style. The reason is, after observing Tomimi's fighting style, they determined that there was some value in studying it. 'Injecting' your own Arts into a wand in order to fill it with lethal power is, from a certain perspective, an utterly fanciful notion. Casters themselves tend to be intellectually curious people as well. After acknowledging Tomimi's combat abilities, a small group of Casters adopted the belief that 'Casters ought to be physically strong.' They even began to hope that a new school of Originium Arts would form through Tomimi's growth— Of course, even if this was to succeed, that'll be some time in the future.",

If you put yourself in her shoes though, Tomimi becoming like this may have been inevitable. Pretend that there's a beautiful young girl.

Everyone wants to be her friend, but she's always at your doorstep, sharing meals with you and asking you to play, showering you with her geniality and grace— What kind of person wouldn't be moved?! Furthermore, this wonderful young girl was stabbed by Originium in the mines in order to protect Tomimi, and ended up contracting Oripathy because of it. Even the bestselling authors of Columbia dare not write such heart-wrenching passages lightly, but this is not a work of fiction. It is Tomimi's truth, and that is why she is so devoted to Gavial. After that, Tomimi dedicated herself to attending Gavial, though the latter mistook this as 'exclusion.' After violently beating down all challengers at the Mahuizzotia, Gavial left the tribe.

After waffling around for quite some time, Tomimi brought out a number of books that had titles such as these:\n'Only One Step Until The New You', 'You're a Winner', 'Learn Business Management in 100 Days'...\nThen, she took out a list of books that often appeared on the bestseller lists of bookstores, mostly related to fashion, self-help, and management. Without a doubt, the contents of these books gave Tomimi some dubious directions when it came to her understanding of the real world. For example... she really tried to apply this corporate management system to the members of the 'Gavial's Will' tribe, demanding that everyone wear a uniform, shout slogans, and fight like a Lupo (note that she had no idea what a Lupo was prior to joining Rhodes Island). Though the tribe had no complaints due to Tomimi's abilities, after she left, everyone in the tribe quickly lapsed into their old, comfortable ways. With this in mind, the rocket launcher incident was probably inspired by one of these books. \nFortunately, Tomimi was able to pick up a number of practical life skills. She is already familiar with storing items in a limited space, an ability that has earned her the praise of dorm staff. In addition, she is proficient in the use of expedition tools, able to explore the wilds without assistance. Nor will she ever again make the mistake of getting trapped in a mine by accident and putting herself in danger. However, Rhodes Island is different from the hometown of her Acahualla tribe. Gone is the near-infinite space she had back there to store her various collectibles. Under Gavial's persuasion, she has begun to screen her treasures, keeping only the most valuable things in a backpack that she carries on her person. \nAll things considered, one cannot say that Tomimi is unintelligent, but rather, all her energy goes into the wrong areas.",

No bad blood at play, no clash that sparked a conflict.

It worked better than anything anyone else had to say, and Flint began to study seriously. \n\n[Voice Log]\n'So what do we do until she learns?

The tribe of Liberi she comes from is naturally of small stature, and it's apparent that their physical fitness compared to other Liberi falls slightly short. One need not even start comparing them to the wealth of combative, healthily robust races surrounding them. This is why Flint's tribe has always had a relatively tough time living in the rainforest. These challenges persisted up until Flint reached the age where she could run and jump, at which point she promptly picked and won a fight with two Archosauria who substantially outclassed her. She beat them on their own ground. \nFlint's fists are fast and tricky. Where she falls short in terms of naturally endowed strength, her race's superiority in speed makes up handily for the deficiency. Her fighting style differs from any boxer with a grounding in theory. She wields her fists to knock her opponent down, pure and simple, and they carry an almost illusory sense of the freedom and danger of the rainforest. \nAs the tallest and strongest warrior in her tribe, Flint was always quite confident of her own build, even proud of it, until she came into contact with other, much taller peoples. Once she came to the realization that most of the entire outside world's population was of much greater stature than her, Flint was quick to give up her arrogance born of ignorance, and she began seeking out new challenges. She went to find those stronger than herself, challenge them, harden and mold herself, improve herself, until she could beat them. \nDo not underestimate her for her size. No Sargon warrior ever feared a challenge. \n\n[Addendum by file author]\nI will refrain from putting her relationship with the taller operators into words. On the other hand, she gets along with our operators of Durin origin. No question about that.",

But we must admit their conduct is full of great fervor, candor and a masterful valor. Operator Flint is an archetypal example of this. \nAs Flint sees it, there is nothing that can't be settled with her fists some way or another. Back in Flint's old stomping grounds, you'd often catch a glimpse of Tiacauh people who'd been wrestling with each other just a moment ago, who'd stood themselves up straight, shook hands and made peace with each other the very next second. After that handshake, they might wrap their arms around each other's shoulders and go off to eat together. Though, generally, they'll get into another fight because of something else altogether before they can sit down. \nIn addition, the Liberi people to which Flint belongs have a love for flowers that far exceeds the norm. Their preference is especially for lushly colored specimens, which can be often found adorning their homes. Operator Flint holds the fundamental notion that flowers are something found everywhere, and freely pickable as one wishes. Even now, living in Rhodes Island's colossus of rebar and iron sheeting, she continues to think so. \nAs Miss Perfumer's greenhouse steadily drew in the horticulture enthusiasts one after another, a great mystery reared its head. Flowers would often be picked without warning. As the days went on, the gardeners whose plants went missing ultimately formed an alliance, agreeing once and for all to teach the delinquent flower-picker a lesson they'd never forget. \nBefore they set out a real action plan, Operator Flamebringer's meticulously cultivated bonsai was burgled overnight—a crucial breakthrough. The concerned parties fought each other bitterly that next day, and finally, under the oppressive gaze of Dr. Gavial, they reluctantly shook hands and made their own peace. \n\nAt least Operator Flint now understands. Unlike the rainforest, abundant with vegetation, she should refrain from picking the flowers she finds growing within Rhodes Island. The greenhouse's keeper has allowed Flint the use of a small flowerbed. You can find the Tiacauh stooping next to it from time to time, her hands, so often closed in fists, carefully pulling the weeds, looking forward to seeing the flowers bloom.",

And when she says it, warrior that she is, she's usually already prepared to safeguard you from any danger as you rest.\n\nOnly, you worry how the warrior of the rainforest hasn't yet fully grasped just how vast, and broad, this world is.

Of course, Lancet-2 is fairly popular amongst operators thanks to her personality, but Eunectes's passion for her is on another level. \nIt isn't hard to fathom why, of course. \nMost of us have probably been so awestruck by something we've never so much as heard of that it sent chills down our spines at some point in our lives. The kind of moment that feels as though you flung open a whole new door, like discovering new untrodden lands. To Eunectes, that moment came as a child when she witnessed a nomadic city just passing through by chance. The gigantic machine, colored in its icy machinery colors, struck her with amazement like never before. That moment came again when she first heard Lancet-2 talk. This time, it was the possibilities that robotics has that struck her with amazement. \nWouldn't most operators be just as surprised when they first come across operations platforms that talk? The difference here is that most operators aren't all that interested in robots and therefore don't react the same way Eunectes does. \nOn the other hand, while Eunectes shows extraordinary respect to other operations platforms as well, Lancet-2 is particularly dear to her. This is actually a glimpse of her normalcy. \nHer special treatment for Lancet-2 can be described as ritualistic and as a sort of emotional sustenance. This is a beacon she picked for herself in her new life, and it can even be seen as the manifestation of what she has always dreamt of achieving herself. \nWhich is why, even though she's the developer of all the operations platforms and the person that Eunectes has come to look up to as her master, Closure has never tried to put a stop to her so-called stupid apprentice's behavior. She probably knows exactly how Eunectes feels.",

By its very essence, it's an idea that runs against their traditions—a breakthrough. \nFrom this point of view, you could say Gavial was the manifestation of tradition itself. She believed in her own strength and didn't seek any outside help. Having abided by this principle for years, this has become one of the most iconic examples of Acahuallan tradition.\nIn other words, by its very essence, this series of events can be seen as a conflict between traditions and breakthroughs. If it wasn't for Gavial's relationship with Eunectes, if it wasn't for the region's lax sense of tradition to begin with, and how modest the Acahuallan people were, history tells us all this would have ended very badly. \nOf course, that is simply conjecture, and this isn't to say that we were lucky things turned out the way they did. Rather, I wanted to pose an interesting question:\nIf Gavial and Eunectes each represented a different lifestyle—Gavial's being the primitive yet free lifestyle while Eunectes represented a more orderly lifestyle that relied upon tools—would we be able to say for sure that one is more correct and would lead to a better life? \nTo take this question one step further, what makes a good lifestyle? \nThere isn't a single correct answer to this question, but if you look at how Gavial and Eunectes are such polar opposites yet alike in some ways, I believe this would be an interesting question to ponder.",

As such, we only brought with us a small number of its spare parts on the way back. \nThe unit we have now is a brand new unit that the whole Engineering Department worked together to rebuild. The Chief Engineer named it 'the Raging Ironhide.' \nOn the outside, this new unit isn't all that different from its predecessor. Inside, however, it couldn't be more different from the haphazardly put-together Big Ugly. It was the fruit of the whole Engineering Department putting their heads together. And supposedly, Eunectes broke down in tears at the workshop when it was finally completed.\nTo her, it was probably the most concrete step she has ever taken to make her dream a reality. \nAside from this, after the Raging Ironhide was completed, the High Priest, who Eunectes has occasionally mentioned as the Big Ugly's pilot, has started popping up frequently here in Rhodes Island.

That being said, there are some occasional exceptions to the norm. Operator Arene is one such exception at Rhodes Island. He is one of the few Sankta here to forgo the use of firearms, instead opting to use Originium Arts as his primary means of attack. \nThe Originium Arts that Operator Arene utilizes are somewhat unusual: his Arts tend to be have toxic, disintegrative, and corrosive traits. As a result, he normally keeps away from crowds in order to mitigate any unnecessary risks. And just like the impression that others typically have of Operator Arene himself, his Originium Arts typically strike others as beautiful yet dangerous, amicable yet seclusive, and requiring extra care to approach. \nDue to his frequent use of Arts, Arene himself usually carries a faint aromatic fragrance.

It is precisely for this reason that, when Arene contracted Oripathy several years ago, his parents opted to send him, their one and only son, away from danger to Leithanien instead of keeping him close by. \nRegretfully, both of his parents were killed during a recent clandestine operation to steal Laterano firearms technology. Their will unfortunately brought Arene plenty of trouble as well—most people seem to believe that a parent would always leave every last thing they treasured to their children. In reality, the only thing that Arene's parents ever wished for was for their only son to live a peaceful life. They knew their research would undoubtedly be taken up by Laterano departments far more up to the task than him. \nEven though the crisis has mostly been averted thanks to Operator Arene's master plan, there still remains enough of a risk that, in spite of the young man's temperament, the poor executor had to escort Arene to Rhodes Island to seek his colleague's help, before taking a temporary leave to deal with some so-called problematic follow-up work. \nDuring his childhood, Arene's parents were often preoccupied with work and had little time to spend with their son, leaving him alone at home most of his childhood. Young children often have a hard time understanding their parents' passion for work. To the young Arene, it was guns that had stolen his parents' attention from him, and that became the source of his apathy against guns, normally admired by Sankta children far and wide. Furthermore, after his infection during the accident, he lost any opportunity to have his own gun. \nPerhaps because he departed Laterano at an early age, Arene tends to be a little sheepish around some of our other Laterano operators. Instead, he is more proactive in interacting with our Leithanian operators. One such example is Operator Eyjafjalla. The two of them had studied under the same famous professor at their university, just barely enough to make them old classmates.",

Mint usually has the 'book' bound with a specially made tie, so as not to cause any accidents. It's as the rumors say—the book will bite people. If someone randomly flips its pages, they'll very likely set off its built-in retaliative mechanisms. It won't cause any life-threatening harm, but according to Mint, 'Its bites hurt so much. It's even worse than stubbing your little toe.' \nMint says she happened upon the book at an old marketplace near school, where all the shops sold old books and worn knick-knacks that had probably traded hands countless times, and where no shortage of questionably-legal goods moved around under wraps. \n'Don't go in there expecting anything. People who treat it as one great treasure hunt by and large end up buying complete useless rubbish, ' stated Operator Skyfire on this topic.

She's taken to life at Rhodes Island very quickly. \nHowever, her wildly scattering curiosity has definitely invited trouble at times. \nOne thing that worries people is while doing something, Mint is distractable. Of course, this isn't to say she has no sense of priority. When a directly pressing matter is at hand, Mint focuses and spares no detail until it's done, but the moment the most critical part is finished, she loosens up, and it's then that something else can easily steal her attention. \nFor example, after a mission, she might be lured away by some novel ore or Originium-infected creature, and will wander off from her team without realizing it until she's lost in the dead of the wilderness... That has happened more than once. \nAnd if this continues without any mediation or regulation, we fear that Operator Skyfire, who already loses her temper whenever it happens, will sooner or later burn the ship out from the inside.",

But we have to ask: is Bubble really suited to that kind of life? \nWhen other children in the tribe were learning the importance of combat skills, Bubble was rushing around, charging into things. She has far more strength and endurance than children of her same cohort, but combat prowess is more than just strength. In the words of her father: 'This girl will not be a warrior.' \nIt is perhaps because he recognized this that her father did not permit Bubble to conceal her wounds and carry on with her life, and instead sent her away from the tribe, away from Sargon, and off to a new future of her own making. \n'At least here, she can have a happy life.' It's hard to imagine such words came from a fierce tribal Cerato warrior, his body well over two meters tall covered head to toe in tattoos and totems. Not long after that conversation, our newly arrived Bubble came crashing through the reception room door. Her father apologized profusely to the operator on duty, all the while holding the crying Bubble by her ear. An hour later, after the operator saw off Bubble's father, the young girl helped herself to a snack: the leaves of our potted plant. \nIt seems Bubble has a lot of growing up to do.",

When asked why, she replied: \n'I want to pound Kay flat!' \nWe know that when Bubble and Ceobe get into one of their 'My Papa could beat up Vulcan' sessions, they sometimes get too into it and the conflict turns physical. They have never drawn weapons and do not escalate beyond shoving. \nIn terms of raw power, Bubble is a bit stronger than Ceobe, but Ceobe's extensive experience and conditioned reflexes always put Bubble at a disadvantage, and the noisy little firecracker usually finds herself overwhelmed.  \nSo Bubble started training.

Whislash of competition knight lineage, however, doesn't care at all whether operators meet a uniform average, instead aspiring to bring each operator's own characteristics to their maximum potential. \nNeither's way of thinking is wrong, but even so, Dobermann and Whislash are both particularly stubborn. They were at an impasse for a while, before finally taking a meeting and reaching a compromise. \nThough perhaps they came to understand each other while butting heads. Ever since then, their relationship's gotten pretty good. You might hear them talking tactics from time to time now, or even just eating meals together.",

Strictly speaking, she cannot, since her standing is as a branch member of the Nearl family, which bars her from directly taking up the name. \nBut this was policy for the Nearl family at its shining peak. Following Nearl's exile, it might've been simple enough, with all that she possessed, to seize the title of Nearl if she so wished. \nMind you, Whislash did not. \nOne part of it was her sisterly relationship with Maria. The other, as she saw it, was that the Nearl name held hallowed significance. \nIn a certain sense, her opinion overlaps with a true direct relative of Nearl's and Blemishine's, their uncle, Młynar—'This is not a name I'd tarnish with such underhandedness.' \nThough, sure enough, they define 'tarnishing' in different ways. \nUnlike Młynar, Zofia does not reject the idea of the competition knight itself. Put another way, she accepts at least its existence—but does not err in her forthright and sporting approach to dueling, which she took to the competition as humble representative of the Nearl family. Unwilling to bow to any sponsors or firms, she went from start to finish lacking any favorable provisions or equipment, until the Final 16 brought her journey to an end. Even now, despite that gulf in equipment taking her left hand out of action indefinitely, she has no regrets. None—come the Major, she wants to make sure Blemishine continues to fight as she once did.  \nIt's plain how in Whislash's heart of hearts, her honor as a member of the Nearl family is unbreakable, and anyone could see how she looks after Nearl and Blemishine. When joining, she even assured us that if Rhodes Island wasn't fit for purpose, she'd prefer to take Nearl and Blemishine with her to raise them herself. We've had some personnel envy the sisters in a way, having an elder who cares for them like that.",

Indeed, though Miss Blemishine's personality seems much different from that of her magnanimous, upright sister, the heroic statures of the two knights on the battlefield as well as the intimacy they have in private speak to the familial love etched within their bloodline. However, perhaps due to her young age when Nearl was expelled from Kazimierz, Blemishine seems to have a deeper and more natural connection with Whislash, as opposed to the pure admiration and longing she carries for her older sister. \nBlemishine is very outgoing, quickly striking it up with most operators. She even reveals her somewhat capricious side to those she is familiar with. When it comes to formal occasions or serious conversations, however, Blemishine is more than capable of conducting herself in the same way her sister does - noble and steady, with gravitas behind each sentence. \nThough she now accompanies her sister on the front lines as a Defender Operator, protecting those who need it, Blemishine has another surprising interest. During her stay on the landship, Blemishine frequently made contact with Vulcan and Closure, and also visited other engineering enthusiasts such as Glaucus and Mayer. Reportedly, on several occasions, Blemishine wanted to ask if she could go to the Engineering Department to observe and study. Considering the prior times she was authorized and how she had gotten so engrossed with various workshops to the point of appearing MIA while being unable to extricate herself, these subsequent requests were tactfully rejected. \n'Having her around feels just like having a sister around, but her passion for craftsmanship is a little overboard.

              "storyText": "Before joining Rhodes Island, Miss Blemishine, also known as Maria Nearl, chose to become a competition knight in order to restore her family's name. Those at Rhodes Island may perhaps be familiar with the name, Nearl, as the code name of Margaret Nearl, the Radiant Knight. However, in Kazimierz, the word 'Nearl' points to an enduring lineage of knights, a family line wreathed in boundless glory. For over a hundred years, this family has produced countless legendary knights — whether using tactical brilliance to subvert the ambitions of Leithanian nobles, or employing their outstanding talents to hold a border garrison that has never fallen. Even after the rise of the competition knights, legendary champions such as Margaret Nearl continued to defend the glory of the Nearl family — but the birth of the Radiant Knight would prove to be turning point for the Nearl family. \nThe Radiant Knight was exiled, and when the Knight Primus passed of old age, Młynar Nearl, the next in line to shoulder the burden of nobility, scoffed at Kazimierz's conception of 'nobility' and refused to become a competition knight. And thus, the Nearl family was left with no Knight Primus. Faced with constant pressure from the Knights Association, as a last resort, the youngest member of the family, Maria Nearl, went with her aunt Zofia to walk the path of a competition knight. Due to her veneration of her sister and aunt, as well as the elder knights she had known since childhood, Maria always held an idealistic view of what it meant to be a knight. Of course, Maria was clever enough to recognize her naivete, often considering whether or not there was some darker undercurrent that was not yet clear to her. But the tortuous complexity of Kazimierz's knight sports far exceeded what the young girl was capable of conceiving. \nIn her brief career as a knight, Blemishine was exposed to many things she had never witnessed before. The young Maria actually never thought too deeply about what it meant to be a knight— after all, she was acting out of consideration for her family, and was reluctantly pushed into becoming a knight out of a sense of responsibility. She took the initiative to assume both the glory and the obligations of her role, a testimony to her virtue, but perhaps because of her noble upbringing, she never seriously considered the relationship between what she saw, thought, and did. In modern society, noble sacrifices and selfless dedication are not as harrowing as they are described in literature, but Maria Nearl nevertheless embraced the simple rationale of 'seizing glory for the family' and called upon the spirit of dedication within her, becoming known as the 'unsociable competition knight.'",

              "storyText": "Kazimierz's commercialization of its ancient class of knights once invited criticism from other countries. But the birth of Kazimierz's knight sports, as well as the existence of knighthood as a whole, are more complicated than most outsiders realize. \nRoughly 120 years ago, Kazimierz's nomadic cities were far less developed than they are today. When a noble knight died without an heir, leaving behind a large swath of land, the Kazimierz National Council auctioned off his property. Specifically, the noble's castle and the mobile platform it was built upon. While this was certainly not an uncommon occurrence in Kazimierz, what made this event remarkable was the winning bidder: not a knight representing some proud noble, but rather an affinity of the deceased nobleman. A single knight-affinity had put forth a huge sum that rendered all the nobles in the room speechless. Furthermore, following notarization by the National Council, each piece of copper plate with which the affinity had purchased the land and the castle was determined to be legitimate income — the knight had handed the family business over to the affinity, who then made the business flourish. In the modern era in which countries jockey to establish connections, one can tell from a glance who has the ability to create wealth. In the following decades, the relationship between the merchant class and the affinities became more closely interconnected. The affinities were the ones who could truly create benefit for the country, able to build walls and even move city-states to defend the country. Due to the volatility between Kazimierz, Ursus, and Leithanien, as well as the intrigue among powerful nobles, the knights had to rely on extremely wealthy guards to consolidate their positions and ambitions. After decades of cruel, bloody change, Kazimierz has finally arrived where it is today. \nIf the overthrow of Kazimierz's Elder regime and the establishment of the knights as the ruling class is Kazimierz's first historical turning point, then the upending of their rule by the mercantile-affinities in a practical sense and the formation of Kazimierz's oligarchical ruling class can undoubtedly be seen as a second turning point. Even the knights and nobles who are quite critical of this development do concede that modern entrepreneurs have made outstanding contributions to Kazimierz — from the forested countryside to the towering spires of the city-states, countless people rely on Kazimierz's corporate economy for food, housing, and transportation — 'It's the economy, stupid.' \nThe current knight sports industry is the result of this bloody social upheaval — the warrior-knights guarding the frontier have all but lost their political status as 'nobles.' Instead, they became warriors directly operating under the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi Kazimierz. Any legal Kazimierz citizen, former noble knight or otherwise, has the right to participate in the knight competitions, win titles, and earn distinctions of nobility, regardless of background. This sporting event, derived from ancient knightly tests of skill, has become an inseparable part of Kazimierz's economy, politics, and culture. Nevertheless, these changes are not palatable for all knights, and undercurrents continue to surge within Kazimierz. \n'Unreasonable, you say? Everyone who found it unreasonable has been eliminated, creating this thoroughly reasonable history. Fortunately, I've accepted this truth. You understand this, don't you?' —Spokesman Malkiewicz's conversation with the Doctor during the Major",

Unlike Operator Whislash, who took on her title as a competition knight, and Operator Nearl, who adopted her family name, Blemishine discarded the shackles of her family and cast aside the intoxicating, gilded path of knighthood. Before her lies an expansive, but lonely, future. Maria understands her immaturity better than anyone else, so she has taken the name of 'Blemishine' to reflect the incompleteness of her light. \nMaria has a favorite knight novel. In the novel, the protagonist experiences bizarre adventures on the way to completing his quest, and this occupies 95% of the book. At the end of the book, the middle-aged knight, no longer needed by his family, no longer favored by the Knight Order, and no longer burdened by his love affair, decides to leave. In a distant seaside country, he once again finds his home as a knight, charging against the waves again and again until his voice becomes hoarse, and he is eventually consumed by the ocean— this abrupt ending was once lambasted by more conservative readers, and this novel is the subject of many intense discussions within the circles of Kazimierz's literary critics. Some say the novel is trash, but others consider the ending a completion of the sublimation of chivalry. \nMaria likes the novel for one simple reason - though many think the tale of puritanical, almost crazed sacrifice incompatible with Maria's personality, Maria found an answer to her own questions in the old novel penned during the early days of Kazimierz's knight sports: the meaning of meaning. \nWhile sitting alone with the Doctor and reflecting on the occurrences in Kazimierz, Maria suddenly smiled and said: 'My sister is the knight who broke the waves.' From the perspective of Maria, younger sister of the Radiant Knight, we gain a glimpse of why Nearl, who always despised knight sports, chose to become Kazimierz's Radiant Knight and why she decided to return to her homeland, only to be exiled again after defeating a powerful enemy. If we treat her pure faith as a prayer of sorts, the Radiant Knight's series of shocking behaviors may actually be the exact same as those of the ancient Wanderer Knight who went to pay homage to the ancestors in front of the grave at the Lone Mountain. \nMaria eventually decided to become her sister's protector, using her exceptional crafting talents to provide assistance to the Radiant Knight. Even Mechanist praised her augmented knight armor. She acted like a little sister when vying for Margaret's attention, and acted like a knight when receiving Zofia's training. She learned to put behind her the things that burdened her in the past. Now, she only wants to know what they, the knights of Kazimeriz, can see hand-in-hand, after the waves have washed away their lances and shields.",

While we are proud of our inclusivity, improper handling of interpersonal relationships can lead to conflict.

Beyond that, she has a natural gift, having grasped several classic and characteristically Leithanian Arts forms as well as an ancient, bloodline-tied Sarkaz witchcraft. This witchcraft lets her consciousness forcibly 'intervene' in her constructs' bodies, allowing what was the unthinking stone and soil to become her own four limbs extended. For example, it's like the difference between holding a sword in her hands, and her hands themselves becoming a sword. Put another way, from the angle of combat efficiency, not much difference at all. These special Originium Arts prove Mudrock's Sarkaz blood still flows pure, but aren't effective for strengthening her constructs' fighting capabilities. However, this is only in terms of the Arts Mudrock presently displays. Considering her future growth, as well as innate talent shown in her self-taught use of Leithanian Arts systems, perhaps these ancient bloodborne methods may become a table-turning ace in the hole of hers.     \nMeriting additional attention is that Mudrock will occasionally refer to her Originium Arts constructs as 'friends,' both Colossus and small as soil clumps alike. We can be sure that Mudrock does not bestow this title purely from her own individuality or personal interest. Perhaps Mudrock's special Originium Arts make her regard her arisen constructs with emotion, similar to a handy tool one has used for decades. Or, perhaps, her prolonged use of witchcraft has given her some curious affinity with the stone and soil. We request to all Operators that should you find Mudrock alone in her room giving a petite clay figure a sweet smile you've never seen before, please, do not be surprised. In the end, her relationship with the soil is likely far greater than her relationship with most people in its intimacy.",

As a result of her rebelling against Reunion's advocacy of violence, Mudrock had absolutely no involvement with Reunion in the reign of terror that befell Ursus. On the contrary, she led her like-minded Sarkaz for Leithanien long before, hoping that in a nation of highly developed Originium Arts, prosperous yet rotten to the core, they could find some place in which to hide away. Mudrock knew well that Leithanien's cities and Spires wouldn't readily admit bloodstained Sarkaz mercenaries, so they elected to wander between remote cities, attracting more and more of Leithanien's Infected during this time. Her benevolence, rare amongst mercenaries, earned her quite the following. Before she realized it, the reputation of the Mudrock Squad had spread across the Infected though she often trails off, blushing, when the topic comes up. It seems that she doesn't like to talk about her 'glorious' moment of popularity.     \nYet all good things come to an end. The vengeful lust of the 'Reunion Movement' was never contained within reason's reach. While Leithanien as a whole had a milder treatment of the Infected, these conflicts naturally spread through other areas due to ulterior motives. After enduring the calamity led by a string of out-of-control riots, Mudrock despondently decided to return to Kazdel, hoping to establish a shelter for her people there.   \nHowever, this plan was also cut short, again by outside forces she couldn't defy. When Elite Operator Logos came across the Mudrock Squad in Kazdel, there were hardly any Sarkaz warriors left by her side, and the minds, spirits, and bodies of the Leithanian Infected who now outnumbered the original members were on the verge of collapse. As for what even happened to the Mudrock Squad between leaving Leithanien and arriving at Rhodes Island, or why Mudrock decided differently at the last minute, we're not at all clear. However, without a doubt, they suffered disastrous losses from some Leithanian power pursued them out of Leithanien. After confirming the opposition was clearly intent on 'slaughtering every last Infected,' Logos opted to come to their aid.",

              "storyText": "Mudrock once asked Operator Folinic. 'What happened to Wolumonde afterwards?'  \nAccording to operational records, Wolumonde is a nomadic city in the north of Leithanien, which was once brought by a Catastrophe to near-ruin in a matter of days. Rhodes Island Operator Atro lost her life in this incident, and the team of Operators dispatched to investigate the incident came into conflict with the Mudrock Squad. However, asked 'whether Mudrock had engaged in unforgivable conduct,' Operator Folinic hesitated for a brief moment before issuing a denial. \nAs for the 'after,' this refers to what followed Mudrock's decisive battle (this wording is in line with the situation at the time, and can be seen as a deliberate effort on Mudrock's part) with Rhodes Island's operators, her defeat, and subsequent withdrawal from Wolumonde.  The sudden fires and revolts gave the Wolumonde officials grounds to recall the Gendarmerie from the nobles. With the Gendarmerie's aid, the afflicted cities successfully established a passage across the Great Rift. Messengers and supply teams arrived soon after at Wolumonde.  After the ordeal, Wolumonde was deeply wounded, not just due to the loss during the conflict and rioting. 'Close to a fifth of Wolumonde's people betrayed Leithanien.' This shadow cast itself deep into the hearts of the locals, and even roused whatever conscience still remained in some of their nobles—and the problems they faced were quite convoluted. \nBased on letters sent by Messengers responsible for the follow-up investigations, with the professional evaluation of the Gendarmerie, we can confirm that the main instigator of the Wolumonde incident, Biederman, died in the riots. The local Schultz was taken in due to his acute Oripathy, and whether he is alive or dead remains unclear. Soon after, the nobles withdrew Wolumonde's autonomy, deciding to merge its intact areas with surrounding cities in the coming spring. \nJudging by the 'experiences' Mudrock described, what the Mudrock Squad and Leithanian Infected saw in Wolumonde was just the tip of the iceberg. You can imagine why the Leithanian Infected within the Mudrock Squad were in such low spirits. We cannot help but recognize that obedience within the Infected's giant cages, giving up freedom may be the only way to eke out an existence in Leithanien. \n\n[Classified Log]\nOn the first night the local nobles arrived to investigate Wolumonde, there was an assassination attempt. After failing, the suspect fled near the Winterwisp Mountains, where he committed suicide by biting his tongue off. He was identified as the local Schultz's only son, Thorwald, who was thought to have died in the fire. The Gendarmerie found a letter on his person: 'I've changed my mind. I'll die in your stead. But there's one thing you have to do for me. If you recognize him, get rid of him.' Because of this letter, and the token of a Catastrophe Messenger carried on the suspect's person, we can confirm that the suspect was an accomplice to Biederman. The noble did not make things harder on Severin Hawthorn, whose life was already in grave danger, but it was obvious he had no good will to spare, and so left Wolumonde. Considering that several other operators are involved in this matter, only a small number of authorized personnel and the Doctor are permitted to view this document.",

Originium granules have been detected in her circulatory system; there are signs of Oripathy infection. \n\n[Cell-Originium Assimilation] <1%\n\n[Blood Originium-Crystal Density] 0.13u/L\n\nMost currently known internal organ crystallization and Originium hyperplasia originate from localized lesions caused by the accumulation of Originium particles in the bloodstream. \nYes, Touch, your hypothesis is more or less on point. \nThis particular subject can perhaps be called an Infected, but it's hard to say this is Oripathy. \nThe Infected organ located in her brain stem isn't natural. That's right... It was an artificial implant. Having referenced Raidian's inspection report, we can say for certain that this device is unmistakably artificial in nature. \n\nIf, just like this particular subject, Specter's Infection was artificially induced... Leaving aside the question of how Specter's immune system is able to fight her Originium infection so fiercely... the liquid Originium density in Specter's cerebrospinal fluid has already reached such a high level that her life is undeniably in danger. We had to resort to all kinds of measures just to prevent her situation from getting any worse, as we naturally should do. \nLet's look at the experiment that was performed on this particular individual. One of the objectives of this experiment was to figure out how to contain the Originium Infection and the negative effects it produces. \nAnd they managed to pull it off, albeit only temporarily. \nFrom the project's inception, their plan was to create an individual who is not afflicted by Oripathy but is nonetheless an Infected. A caster who doesn't need an Arts Unit. A master of Originium Arts who does not need to be trained in its theory. \nHer Infected organs do not exacerbate the Originium density in her body in any way. In a certain sense, this individual is as good as not Infected. \nWith her life functions still in perfect order, should we really remove this artificial organ? The organ that lets her breathe and swallow, and lets her blood flow normally? \nI'm afraid we haven't met that requirement. No one has. This experiment is likely impossible to reproduce in the short term, and we are supposed to reverse its results, to return her body composition to normal? \n\nThe Loken Watertank Laboratory is a shambles. The little research data they had were all wiped out as well. We will likely never know whether the data was destroyed or successfully retrieved by its sponsor. The lab's actual proprietor would prefer to keep news of the scandal under wraps. The technological companies looking to thrive in the wake of Loken Watertank's downfall are likely a dime a dozen, and who knows how many spies there are in the Columbian cities? \nLoken Williams was a genius, but his ignorance and apathy led to the deaths of many, including his own in the very end. Poetic justice, no doubt. \nThe Maylander Child Rights Protection Foundation's rescue of the individual from the laboratory ruins and their subsequent exfiltration from the country were the result of its board's careful deliberation. They were intent on keeping Loken's research results out of the hands of Columbian companies and interest groups. If the research conducted at Loken was allowed to continue to ferment, it would only result in further instability. This will not be tolerated. They will not allow it. They would rather pretend it happened in the first place. \nIn the end, the girl ended up under my care... Perhaps by fate, or perhaps because, along with Loken's mentor, I was the one who ended Loken's life as an Oripathy researcher in Columbian academia. But we both knew it in our hearts that he wasn't going to be stopped by that. It was nowhere close to enough to stop someone who would claim the lives of everyone who walks upon this land for his own benefit. \nWith this, our cooperation with Maylander came to an end. This would be the final mission ever to be sanctioned by them and carried out in secret by us. This individual, the experimental subject, will forever disappear from Columbia's records. \n\nMaylander doesn't care if she lives or dies. What happens to her from here onwards is up to us. \nBut what would her treatment—the removal of this artificial organ—entail? The damage this has on her system may be minimal. \nThe device does not have a replacement function. It had never crossed their minds to implement such a function. \nThe device has already become a part of the individual. They turned her Arts Unit... into her life source. \nI don't have the right to ask her to give up her own life. \n...However, ethics is a matter between you and me, not Rhodes Island. \n\n——Dr. Kal'tsit",

There isn't very much we can say about that...\nHowever, her Arts... Well, we've stopped holding the tests indoors already, but the data we got from the tests before explains a lot. \nI guess it's not a good idea to talk theories here. I mean, I don't really understand theories myself. The theoretical casters are always talking about stuff like perception reversal and thought impetus. Seems to have to do with cognitive science and neurology, and things I'm bound to never understand. \nLet's just talk about her Arts' performance. Right, I mean, there's quite a lot that's classified, and this information is just here to give you the gist. \nSome of us have started to call her Arts her spiritual entity. After all... This is a very fitting and convenient way to describe it. \nHer Arts can stretch out into a wide 'net' that can detect the movements of objects within its range. The 'net' covers a huge area, and most people are unaware of her 'touch.' Her Arts can also be used on just a single individual. I suppose it's like a big hand... I've tried asking her to keep her Arts's range to the smallest area possible, but, even then, she can only manage to shrink it down to a few square meters. I'm guessing that's because she's trying to 'grip' her target. Aside from that, it doesn't seem she can use this power on the inside of her target. Even when we gave her a transparent pitcher with its innards clearly visible, she couldn't make the pitcher burst from the inside. All she could do was squeeze it from the outside. This looks even more and morelike a flexible, malleable force-exerting entity. \nDuring the test process, still going by that 'hand' and 'grip' imagery, we surmised she's able to use at most four of those large, shapeless 'hands' of hers when her concentration is at its peak. It seems the test results were measured based on her Arts' activity and deep water testing. Both her speed and strength measurements go to show that there is tremendous power hiding in her Arts, yet we aren't even able to detect any signs of her using her Arts before they break something. \nWhy just four, and why are they all shapeless 'hands'? Is that how she imagines them? Indeed, when we were examining the deformation of her targets' structures, we can't help but think that some of the bumps might be the gaps between her fingers...\nAnd whenever there was a considerable temperature difference, she would also seem to get frostbite or burns when she uses her Arts... neurally speaking, at least. There weren't any apparent symptoms. She would just say... 'It's cold'... or 'It hurts.' And based on her cerebral cortex's activity, it's true. \n(The voice in the recording gets softer)\nI heard an explanation that's kinda out there... even scary. \nThey say her brother still lives within her. And her Arts are like... her brother reaching out his hands, either hugging the land or pounding it with force. \nI have no idea who was the first person to say that. It's unsettling. \n\n——Recording of Field Reporter Caster KK",

I have no idea if this is Kal'tsit or Outcast's idea, but there's no doubt she's got better thanks to this. \nShe's not like the other experimentation victims I've seen. They're either always screaming their lungs out, or they've already lost their ability to live and take care of themselves; they're always just curled up in their vessels, trembling. \nMy first impression is that she is from a middle-class family and has received a certain amount of education. But when her mental state is unstable, the destruction she wreaks on the ship sure is a terrifying sight to behold. \nShe fears laboratories. She hates medical equipment. And even though our equipment is already several times hardier than normal armor, she even managed to lift one up into the air and crushed it into a ball about the size of a fist. I suppose if it wasn't for Logos, all of us would've long been dead several times over. \nBut thanks to that, we now have a pretty good picture of the kind of life she lived. Kal'tsit has recently requested Engineering to renovate some of the laboratories and rehab sickrooms. I also took the opportunity to replace some of the equipment in the testing facilities to give them a more comfortable, warmer feel. \nAnd now she doesn't make quite as much of a scene. \nTrying to talk to her about what's right or wrong isn't going to do us much good... She's a very sensible kid to begin with. She demonstrates a kind of mental sickness not dissimilar to memory loss. Sometimes, she even forgets her professional knowledge. \nNonetheless, we found that reinforcing her knowledge bit by bit is effective. Touch speculates that she hasn't actually forgotten. She's merely sealed her memories. We think this might have to do with the device in her brain. Or perhaps this is the result that she wanted, and her Arts helped her achieve that. \nHer Arts definitely isn't as simple as a kind of telekinesis. Her past torments her, and that's why she's trying to erase her memories. But she also isn't able to control the strong, unorderly emotions left over... It's a mess. Then, she gets upset that she's forgotten again, and gets anxious and confused because of that. She gets distressed for not meeting our expectations, even though we'd be more than willing to cheer her on and help her. She will still blame herself. \nAt the very least, it's not possible for us to retrace her participation in the experiments. She has practically dug her entire brain out. It's a violent way to go about it, almost like she sealed herself away. Her amnesic symptoms might even be side effects of this behavior. \nHer cognitive ability is being exhausted by herself relentlessly. My guess is her artificial organ is using it up to deal with her ongoing stress. \n\nI think she needs a recorder. I will make her a terminal. One that's easy to type on. That way she can go over her notes whenever she wants, dig up those scenes and dialogues she wants, and restore her emotions back to the truths in her head and reorganize them. Just like giving a movie its dialogues back. \nOnce she asked me why I wouldn't let her wear shoes in the room. As I explained the safety side of it, I also thought of borrowing a pair of shoes from Amiya for her to wear when she leaves the cabin. Amiya came over herself. She even brought with her a new pair of shoes, and were they not a perfect fit. The two kids were fast friends. Amiya was very skilled at comforting her. \nI thought to myself. That was the moment the patient's life truly began instead of some point in the past. There are still lots of mysteries surrounding her, but what does any of that matter? \nKal'tsit said she'll put up a poll for the casters and medical elite operators after a while. I'm in engineering, so I'm not voting, but if I had a vote, I would probably vote to let her stay on the island. If what she needs is someone to guide her through her stress, to teach her how to control her Arts, then we're the right men for the job. \n\n——Indistinct personal records found inside a folder.",

              "storyText": "Loken Watertank isn't the source of the problem. \nWhen it all happened, Loken was likely under a lot of pressure. Otherwise, knowing his personality, he would not have made such a gamble. \nI'm not trying to defend him, but by trying to dissect his actions, I might also be able to verify a few of my viewpoints. \nMy guess is that he urgently needed some test results that supported his hypothesis, either to get his hands on some resources, to maintain his position, or to preserve his project. \nLoken implanted this artificial organ in this particular subject only because his research had to do with the Infected. If his research was in the bionics, then no matter how many of her organs ended up getting replaced, the subject would not have had even the tiniest traces of Oripathy. \nThe subject and her brother were dragged into this mess only because they had a somewhat unique gift in Originium Arts... Their adoption after their family was destroyed, their fraudulent guardian, the corrupt orphanage all played a hand. \nI won't rule out the possibility. Maylander's report clearly says that Loken murdered her brother to fulfill his experiment's objectives. The direct cause of the incident was that the 'consciousness' that he forcefully extracted from her brother activated her Infected organ. \nWhether this is purely a product of her imagination or is indeed just like what was reflected by the errors in the scans... It's eerie, I know. But her 'brother' might still exist somewhere in her brain. She probably doesn't want to know about this yet—This stems from her subconscious refusal, or perhaps it's the wishes of her 'brother.' \nExccessive theoretical neuroscience intersts me not. Such experiment was entirely profit-driven. Its data was tainted by blood. This kind of data can only be used to back theories that support war and violence. We don't need that. \nLoken Watertank had been under the table for long. The fact that a laboratory of its size was able to direct such deep, inhumane crimes just goes to show how far down this road of privilege Columbia's scientific research has come. \nCompared to Ursus and Sargon, Columbia's laws are no doubt more advanced and stringent. But how severe the law is has nothing to do with how many crimes have gone unpunished.it actually is. Both the ones who enforce the law and those who administer it are only people. A progressive society carries the burden of being even more 'civilized.' \nThat's how that fate befell her. Just simply because they needed her to be an Infected, they wanted her to have those powers, being able to expand her Arts casting by the way of compressing her consciousness... \n\nPerhaps it was Volvort Kochinski or Rhine Lab... and it's a bit of a stretch, but it could also have been pharmaceutical companies like Parasol or Tower Mountains... but in any case... It doesn't matter who Loken Watertank's benefactors were. \nWhoever they are, there's an even bigger disaster waiting for them sooner or later. \n\nSo, the vote's results... My guess is there are two votes against. \nLogos agreed as well, didn't he? Hm? No, I'm not surprised. You may think he doesn't care about anything other than Kazdel affairs, but if that was the case, he wouldn't have agreed to become an elite operator in the first place. \nIt's just like those two to vote no... Pith was against it, and I suppose that's only natural. \nI'll persuade them. \nOf course, you guys practically forced this one on me. Right, Touch, you guys voted yes. You guys should be the ones to persuade them. I'm merely trying to speed things up. \nMy reason for doing this? \nI was giving her a checkup this morning, and she asked me if I remember what her name was. \nShe wants to know what she used to be called. She's slowly trying to face her past... even if it's already ruined her once. Or perhaps she should get a new name. \n...If our cities and our residents are truly more advanced than the bloodthirsty barbarians of ages past, then we must at least prove that our personalities have improved. \nPreventing science from being used to harm the innocent is also a responsibility of mine. \nPerhaps it's still too early to give her a name. She should come up with her name herself. But we can give her a codename right now. \nI believe that by becoming an operator, her future, as well as that of the world itself, will become that much brighter. Now that all of you agreed, I promise I will teach her. She will still become your family... Your teammate. \nShe can do it. \n[In the old mythologies, there exists a miraculous plant that helps those who cannot face their memories to be brave and courageous. From here on out, her codename will be Rosmontis. ]",

To the roving doctor, this act seems to hold a special kind of sense, each ticket stub representing some memory she doesn't want to forget.  \n\n[Classified Log]\nSetting aside her innate frailty, by her own disclosure, we've ascertained that Miss Whisperain falls under a very rare branch of the Ægir, possessing an extraordinary constitution. Under the effect of the race's characteristics, this type of Ægirian is exceptionally frail.

One of their favorite pastimes is developing 'Arts Units' that look nothing like conventional units— and often don't work at all. \nThe Arts Unit that hangs at Jackie's waist, gun-type Arts Unit PT-29, is the pride of the Engineering Department. \nRegrettably, even though Jackie applied for such an Arts Unit, it is only due to a habit formed while serving as an auxiliary police officer. Jackie herself is incredibly uninterested in the subject of Arts and her scores are very disappointing. Because of this, this Arts Unit is mostly an accessory to this day.",

Some of her teammates can even recite her entire speech from beginning to end by heart now. \nHer story may be hyperbolic to some extent, but her father was still willing to bring his own infected daughter to Rhodes Island in person. Throughout his short stay in Rhodes Island, he never openly displayed any animosity towards the other Infected, and even remained agreeable to his daughter joining Rhodes Island after learning about some of Rhodes Island's more dubious activities. At the very least, he is not overly biased towards the Infected, even if he is just exercising self-restraint. That alone is already very rare amongst the non-Infected. \nJackie's good manners and lively attitude in daily life is likely also a result of her father's teachings. \nFrom that perspective, her father is indeed a policeman worth respecting, and a good father.",

After coming to Rhodes Island, not only did this ability allow her to befriend others easily, it also gave her a new goal——To help the other Infected. \nBesides curing her Oripathy, she also wants to lend a hand to the other Infected.

This is the biggest reason.\nNow, Kal'tsit didn't really tell me what he's worth, and my guess is she couldn't be bothered to tell me, but it isn't very hard to figure out what exactly it is. Mountain can cut open new paths, and through these new paths, we can get into places that we couldn't have otherwise. He might also be a trump card, especially one that can be used to negotiate with Rhine Lab.\nWell, saying this makes me feel like I'm a baddie... Whatever, only a few people have the clearance to read this anyway.\nTo tell the truth, though, if we don't have to, I'm not sure I'd want to get on Rhine Lab's bad side. Since we're working together, it's better to just stick with the status quo. I'm sure Kal'tsit doesn't want to cross them, either. Which means that while Mountain does have some utility in that sense, she probably isn't thinking of using him that way for the time being.\nThis also means that, to put it in less flattering terms, Mountain is just a refugee that Rhodes Island chose to take in.\nFeels kinda like it's more or less the same thing we always do.\nAfter all, we get a lot of folks with pretty messed up pasts. You could probably say what Mountain's been through was cute, compared to those guys. With traumatic pasts a dime a dozen here, what's the harm in taking him in?\nI'm not trying to be condescending or anything. He's a fine, young man, and he knows what's appropriate and not in all kinds of situations. Most young folks these days aren't sharp like that, tsk tsk.\nAnyway, I've had a little chat with him and everyone else who was involved in the jailbreak. To avoid attracting any unwanted attention, we'll keep everything that has to do with Rhine Lab and the jailbreak classified; anything else is fair game, though—Looking at the information I got afterwards, it looks like all the info about his jailbreak was suppressed, so I suppose all this hush-hush is working.\nHe also promised me that he'll at the very least let us know in advance if he ever decides to do anything against Rhine Lab, so I guess everyone's happy.\n——■■■",

It likely also has to do with the fact his fierceness on the field hasn't changed how courteous he normally is—\nA person who's brutal on his enemies can still be likable to his friends and family. Once they realize that his graciousness isn't a mere social pretense, most would naturally come to understand that his ferocity and his friendliness are two sides of the same coin.\nHowever, it's likely that he isn't aware of this himself.\nAfter all, he himself claims that his composure, his calm, and his politeness are all just a mask, a facade.

One could say, as someone with gang dealings far and wide from childhood, she caught onto a survival philosophy of her own. That philosophy's embodiment—playing the good kid.\nShe absolutely does not care if people hate her for this mask of hers; really, it might make her happy. She doesn't want to be adored by very many, nor is she planning on adoring very many herself. This painstaking pretense is, as she sees it, the optimal tool for maintaining her sense of distance from others.\nIt's clear this approach stems from the day-to-day affairs of the gray zone—betrayal, deceit, bloodshed. In such surroundings, putting yourself first is the best approach.",

Her attitude towards the Doctor is a similar twist, one we can pry into for limited insight.\nKafka and others like her will often avoid getting in too deep with any one person, as they'd be unable to maintain their mask. Plainly, though, as an Operator, Kafka has no way of avoiding frequent contact with the Doctor, and in the course of this, she understandably has times where she drops her own act.\nGoing by the Doctor's observations, Kafka's inherent nature doesn't surprise too many—in truth, to our many life-weathered operators, Kafka's pocketful of tricks barely does her justice—her personal loyalty, her strong empathy, her living in the moment, not letting the future grip her.\nThat is her, and if she considers the Doctor her number two friend, then Silence, whom she met by chance, is her number one.\nIt is beyond us to learn just what level of contact she and Silence had in the past. That said, even here at Rhodes Island, she'll mock Silence's rectitude on one hand while unable to stop worrying about her on the other.

So she opted to bear her father's hysteria, all the while heading out alone, earning money by herself to keep the house going.\nIn spite of her relatively light build, she looked up to the robust, talented protagonists she'd seen since childhood in movies, and so when times at home were good, she took martial arts classes, and by her own efforts built up a good physique, as well as impressive combat skill for any ordinary person. Though adulthood came and she was nothing close to a hero who could plumb Paradise and Inferno alike, it did streamline finding herself a job.\nShe first tried to pursue mental labor, but she quickly realized such work couldn't support her father's spendthrift habits. Afterwards, she began seeking all sorts of physical work, and ultimately found a decent job as a bodyguard.\nThe job, however, was barely enough to maintain their livelihood, and she still sought better-paying work all throughout. Moreover, Robin has made it clear that during that period, how dangerous the work was no longer mattered much to her, as long as it could make any money.\nIndeed, she never imagined it'd be a turning point from where she'd meet Mountain and Silence, and eventually come to Rhodes Island.\nIn the end, even if her father can recover with Rhodes Island's aid, even greater problems will sooner or later arise should he fall back on his older self-abandoning ways, and it's clear that Robin would be powerless against them.\nThough it often doesn't end well when outsiders interfere in these types of domestic affairs, Robin herself has turned to the Doctor and asked for help, so it should be feasible at the least for the Doctor to offer her some suggestion of direction.\nWe hope for a day when things can improve for her.",

The insurance industry, having been built atop these games of words and conspiracies, naturally had a way with words to weasel out of paying their benefits. Of course, it should come as no surprise that the insurance companies were unwilling to pay for a medical bill this expensive. And while all parties involved were still trying to pass the buck, the hospitals naturally refused to treat a workman who was unlikely to be able to pay for his treatment. The reason this tragedy occurred in the first place is that Pinecone's father had signed a contract that was manipulated, allowing the construction company to legally get away from paying him any compensation.\nWho could say a father who only ever wanted the best for his daughter and did everything to help her leave that small town was to blame? The contract he had to sign just to be hired as a construction worker was dozens of pages thick; it shouldn't be hard to tell where the problem actually lies.\nAll Pinecone could do was comfort her crying mother as her father signed his release forms, thus refusing any further treatment—Yet, out of nowhere, one of the material suppliers on the project sent them a substantial sum and footed the medical bill out of 'humanitarian concerns.' After that, the construction company's head honchos finally found the time to leave their offices and pay Pinecone's family a visit at the hospital, even promising to properly compensate her family.

Come fall and through winter, if safety held, he would take Hildegard out of the city, to the great snowcapped mountains. As Hildegard learned the arrow, she displayed incomparable talent, which would serve as a foundation for her outstanding displays at Landen Monastery in the future.\nHowever, every time life at the monastery comes up, the cheery and earnest Archetto takes up a begrudging look. Whether the lax elders or the ever-snoozing Landen bishopry, it seems Landen Monastery is a peerlessly undisciplined, carefree place. 'If there weren't a sign on it, you could call it a nursing home and I'd believe you,' so Archetto laments. Though by the looks of it, she truly did enjoy her time back there.",

Maybe it's the soil and the feed that give Landen Monastery's cystybeasts such voluminous builds, with milk nothing like the oily, throat-parching stuff from Ursus breeds. They use this cystymilk to make cheese, and pour it over the bread after melting it, producing the exquisite, second-to-none taste of a monastery's special cystymilk bread.\nBeyond that, the monastery also has an in-house brewery. Their beer, with malt concentrations to beat them all, has a distinct aroma, once welcomed by aristocrats lucky enough to sample it. In the early days, the Landen bishopry had no interest in any industrial pipeline for the monastery to scale up production of the beer, it spread only by word of mouth amongst nobles and religious figures, but come Landen Monastery's economic winter, plenty of voices rose up inside. A young bishop declared: 'In all honesty, I don't care whether we make the tradition a commodity, or we don't. But taking faith and peddling it—that deserves our wholehearted resistance.'\nWhen a monastery fully becomes a mercenary organization, a pasture and a brewhouse all at once, it can be bewildering. Nevertheless, seeing how proud Archetto looks as she markets those goods, surely Laterano's a fine enough place.",

However, no matter what it was now, it couldn't fall short with Archetto's excellent firing technique working it. These came from Archetto's childhood winters, when her father would take her to the great snowcapped mountains. He taught her how to hunt, how to draw a bow, how to aim.\nThat said, relying only on a bow and arrow to rejuvenate a monastery would be utter nonsense. Once she left Laterano, Miss Archetto fumbled her way through the bishopry's remaining contacts, one by one visiting a great many cities, signing just as many deals. But Archetto knew deep down the Monastery was hardly an industrial plant, and these business deals hither and thither would less change the Monastery's current condition than it would take the Monastery's growth somewhere strange. Aiming to find the Monastery a true foundation for long-term collaboration, using any means she cares for, Archetto still strives to this day.\nOf course, 'almost took a wrong path' describes more than the Monastery, but for now, let's not look too hard into that time someone nearly induced Archetto to become an intercity net idol.",

However, as times changed, the Landen Guard began facing all sorts of problems with their employment framework. With a certain bishop's backing, the Monastery presided over the establishment of a complete educational system, further trialing the admission of a few youths to study at the Monastery. After that, the bishop also suggested that 'the Monastery ought to become a buoy of our faith,' and advocated admission of persons beyond Laterano. After that, some bishopry even suggested that 'justice is as faith,' and that Landen Monastery needn't be confined to the security and guarding of large-scale religious activity, as long as they could guard their true love, their Laterano—and so Landen Monastery appeared across every corner of the world.\n'History pushes for Landen Monastery's progress.

At the least... in Bluishsilver's will, I hadn't seen any clause relating to that radio. Yet that doesn't prove that this agreement left behind was meaningless from the start. If she'd... actually received this 'gift,' surely she'd be so happy...\nFrom what I see, Iris is totally unused to this 'business' of hers, or perhaps she's only just taken over this hereditary sort of 'public service'—sorry, I can't find any other way of describing it. It's altruistic, there's no pay, you spend such an extreme amount of resources to do it. Probably, more than the children who take them up, Iris is the one who truly believes in fairytales.\nFor many, fairytale stories languish in the backs of their minds when they've grown up, but Iris? I can put it this way:\nShe's the one who makes fairytales real.",

Casting with full power, she could very well sink the most focused adult into slumber, but this level of casting takes a lot out of her, and she'll only use it while on missions. At other times, results are about as effective as a decent dose of long-release sleeping aids. She usually casts within cozy environments so that over a quarter of an hour, the target's mood will steadily settle, and they fall asleep safe and snug. After that, Iris may fully apply the most important part of her Originium Arts: operating dreamlands.\nThis ability can put off many people when they first hear it, since falling asleep and giving rise to a dreamland is one internalized expression of the unconscious mind, and if someone could mess around in it, to put it loosely, it wouldn't be much different from indirectly controlling someone.\nBut we believe Iris wouldn't do that—a conclusion we've come to after her arriving at Rhodes Island, and our interaction with her. She's never shown such inclinations in her nature, and going by our surface understanding, her duty and dignity wouldn't allow her to play wantonly with others' dreamlands.\nBesides, Miss Iris's so-called 'operating dreamlands' actually has some strict limits. She needs to have had prior contact, prior awareness and prior understanding before she can reconstruct key elements within dreamlands. Moreover, the everyday things Miss Iris comes into contact with are most, if not all, good and nice things. Even her most beloved fairytales—we know Victoria has many that would strike fear into people—are ones she only knows the revisions of, sanitized and upright editions, their contents portraying wonderlands that would never exist upon this world. Thus, what Miss Iris portrays to others likely are, and can only be, in such form.\nAs for why a castle, master and banquet are bound to appear in everyone's dreams?\nIf you may look at the attachments; one photo of Miss Iris herself casting, one of Miss Iris's estate—a small-scale nomadic castle—and one of its interior decoration. I invite any Operators able to recall their dreamlands' contents to compare with these.\nThe conclusion goes without saying.\n\n'I get it!

Their shells are hard, they have considerable strength, and the weight they can carry is substantial. At the same time, their body density is low, making them much lighter than they seem and allowing them to complete most of their tasks with relative haste.\nWith such qualities, Beanstalk thought the Metal Crabs would be well-suited to tasks such as mining, transportation, and certain special rescue or prospecting tasks. Her hunch wasn't far off, either. Rhodes Island conducted several tests specifically formulated for the crabs and subsequently issued a detailed evaluation report. Aside from the advantages their breeder previously postulated, the report also pointed out that the animals have potential in areas such as reconnaissance and frontline combat.\nAfter reading the report, the astute breeder immediately went to work and started writing away. Then, after just a week, she had a new proposal for the Doctor about their future collaboration waiting on the desk. In the proposal, the Metal Crab breeder got straight to the point and simply emphasized her one condition: She would go on vanguard missions with her crabs, she would be the only one allowed to give them orders, and she would have the authority to order them to retreat if she deemed the situation too dangerous.\nShe was unwilling to compromise on this demand, and funding was of no concern to her as long as this was met.",

Supposedly, she has started planning a new product called 'Beanstalk's Fine Pet Food...' I wish her good luck from the bottom of my heart.\nAs a farmland owner, Beanstalk's father is actually not very supportive of his daughter's entrepreneurial endeavors, or more specifically, he does not support his daughter's choice of breeding animal, Metal Crabs, as they are seen as peculiar and incapable of producing anything valuable to the older generation. This weighs rather heavily on Beanstalk. She has no qualms with taking over the family business, but she insists that breeding Metal Crabs is a worthwhile undertaking that will bear fruit.\nShe insists as such not just because she was once rescued by a small cast of wild Metal Crabs when she found herself in an accident out in the wilderness, but also because she saw a huge potential in these little critters. She truly believes that her hard work now will earn her everyone's respect in the future. Beanstalk had an argument with her family over this belief and chose to leave home, hoping to one day make a name for herself and be acknowledged by her family.\nAlthough life has been difficult ever since, Beanstalk has never found herself dismayed by the difficulties she faced.

A lot of operators are curious about the umbrella, but don't dare ask Tuye about it.\nPerhaps this photograph sent from her mother and father can offer some clues. The Tuye in the picture is considerably younger than the present; perhaps only three or four years old. As we can see, the scene in the photo should be of her home. She's tucked entirely under the umbrella, holding some components in her arms. They are clearly Columbian-produced parts she has in a pile, assembled to imitate all sorts of items—some like chairs, some like beds.\nFrom a developmental psychology perspective, many children have this same tendency—treating the space under an umbrella as an independent space, a home of just their own. This can be because the parents are overly busy, caring insufficiently for these children, and so cause them to feel lonely. For this reason, they seek a smaller, more controllable space, where they only need to get along with themselves. My belief is that Tuye is one such case.\nNowadays, she still carries this umbrella. Perhaps, and I do mean perhaps, she considers the cover of the umbrella to be her home, just as before. Could a person entice her to come out from underneath? I don't know about anyone else. But in my belief, the person reading this file now, in whom all of Rhodes Island has placed their unwavering trust, certainly can.",

He was brought to the city to learn martial arts, and there he settled down.\nSome cities in Yan have traditions of martial arts establishments, ever since ancient times. However, following the expansion in scope of nomadic cities, and the formation of communication links between city-states and even whole countries, the feel of these 'martial arts of the people' underwent much change. A great deal of youths nowadays practice them, many to keep themselves fit, with self-defense as an aim. Martial arts tournaments held by establishments all over, with grand stages, come to make business activities a primary concern. Still, a tiny proportion hold to the attitude that 'martial arts should halt a war,' and silently pass on those genuine teachings. Certainly, Mr. Nothing's school was one of those.\n'My only issue was learning it wouldn't earn me much. Times of peace, eh.' —Mr. Nothing",

This gave all the local powers an excuse to pressure the Liens. Come the end, his master bled dry, and he was forced to go incognito, fleeing far from his homeland.\nAccording to Mr. Nothing, his master was old. Not only that, but her disciples numbered few, with no real money or power to their names, nor any show they could make of ability. The Liens was situated in Kou-wu City, yet not lively enough to match even next door's gymnasium. Why all sorts from all corners would come to target this tiny little school, and why people are still out for Mr. Nothing's life while he poses no threat so far away from home, those are the mystifying points.\nQuestioned directly, Mr. Nothing gave a bitter chuckle, and then a rather evasively phrased reply: such is martial arts.\nAfterwards, Mr. Nothing began expounding knowhow on growing rice in the paddies, diverting from the topic.",

It was fortunate a Catastrophe Messenger alerted them in time, and they didn't bear the Catastrophe's direct brunt.\nAdditionally, she recounts that even as many mountain monasteries resisted incorporating into cities, most mastered their own rapid dismantlement and reestablishment in contrast.\nBeyond that one relocation, she'd never once descended the mountain before, having always lived a frugal life in the monastery. It's thus that life below the mountain was entirely unknown and unfamiliar to her.\nSaga says that at the start, her old head priest was opposed to her descending, for a very simple reason: Saga was too pure, and were she to enter worldly society, he feared there would be much problem.\nHowever, Saga further says that late the night of his refusal, he roused her awake, and the two of them went to the monastery's square. Master and disciple—forefather and descendant—they took a staff to each one, an answer to each question, from the moon true overhead until first light in the east, when ultimately, the head priest allowed her to descend.\nSaga states she still doesn't understand to this day why the head priest would fight her and then let her go, but Saga has close to forgotten about what they asked and answered on that night, to the point we are unable to unearth the full picture. But perhaps it was within Saga's answers that the head priest confirmed something, and so could allow her to embark on her practice with full confidence.",

All we know is that in her time in Yan, Saga coincided with Lava and Rhodes Island by chance. That said, after joining Rhodes Island, Saga's first act was to immediately find Lava and Kroos in the middle of training. They all regarded their chance reunion with pleasant surprise. However, Saga only learned afterwards that the course she took while 'lost' happened to fall right behind Lava's team—in other words, at almost the exact same time, both parties made it to the office, and arrived at the Rhodes Island landship, which struck a particularly ironic note.\nSaga knows of many things. So many that her age seems at odds with her experiences. People have asked Saga out of curiosity where she'd traveled before, and Saga always recounts it piece by piece without reservation. Occasionally, you might hear some profound philosophy fall from the young monk's mouth, though she doesn't make any note of it in the least. The problem is, Saga's age suggests her leaving Higashi to wander the map couldn't have been any more than ten years ago. Just where had she seen so many people and walked so many roads?\nSaga says, it was in pictures.\n'I do not tell lies. Good sir, thou faceth me now, and I respect thee just as I ought. I am unable to speak in more definite terms, so I ask: fault me not for talking in riddles!' —Saga\n'Quit bothering Saga. You can go ask our friendly little stay-at-home Dusk all about it. If you dare, anyway.' —Lava",

Let yourselves go while you're at it. \nYou really want to choose this subject? \nLet's see if I can talk you out of it. Just clear your mind and think for a minute. \nLava and Saga both said they unknowingly made their way into Dusk's scroll, and Saga even said she traveled across the scrolls for ten years. \nI'm paraphrasing but that's basically what they said. It means they were actually wandering through the landscapes of her paintings for a time. \nAnd now, after a very short period at Rhodes Island, we've got reports of people experiencing hallucinations. We looked into food poisoning or research accidents, but all signs point to that closed door and our operator awaiting assignment. \nThe towering cities, infinite waves, blinding snowscapes, they are all depictions from Dusk's paintings. All just paintings. \nIs it a trick of the optic nerve? Or Arts applied at the cognitive level? We theorized, but after heeding Nian's advice to use firecrackers to force Dusk out of her room, and after two solid hours of questioning, our hypotheses were overturned by the facts. \nDusk remains cooperative. I would guess she just wants to avoid trouble? And she'd rather not have to move too much. That's how artists are, I know. \n\nTell me, researcher, where is the line between hallucination and perception? \nTake a look behind you and see for yourself, the vibrant blue. The autumn chrysanthemum. An HR operator picked it out of the sea of flowers that appeared to her. \nDoes this give us a glimpse into how Dusk functions? At least a little? \nWell, yes, Dusk also participates in missions. Surprising, isn't it? She actually goes out. \nI went on one of these little cultural outings. These titles etched into my mind: 'Ink into Armies', 'Bleached Bones Abound', 'Rivers Run Red.' It was a few smugglers, and they surrendered on the spot, as they should. I touched the blood, I smelled it, it was so real. It couldn't be more real. \nBut if you close your eyes... no, not right now. You have to close them right at the start. \nNone of it is real. \nI tried it once with Dusk. Yes, you close your eyes and let her paint, and what she paints you can't see or touch. \nThe truth is, you will get the same answer if you ask her. She doesn't hide anything, she's just unable to explain it herself from a theoretical perspective. \n'As long as you didn't see it, it didn't happen.' \nSo how do those who have seen the painting meet those who haven't? Our sample is too small to give an answer now. We need more data and experimentation. \nAs for aerosolized crystal concentrations, energy spillage and such, we have not observed anything at all. In other words, this is not Originium Arts. \nThat's good, isn't it? You still want to choose this course of study? You're so interested in Dusk's paintings? \nThen I won't stop you. Interest can be frustrating in the end, but the process itself is enjoyable. \nRemember to doubt, remember to verify. Good luck, researcher.",

Her relationship with Hibiscus has also finally been repaired, and the two sisters have learned to tolerate and understand each other. What a great ending.\n'What do you mean, 'what a great ending?' Do you know how what she did right after I 'compromised' with her? Healthy meals, healthy meals, and healthy meals! Not only that, she even gets in the way of my training and makes me go to bed before it's even dark out so to keep me from pulling all-nighters! Hmph, I'm not gonna let her push me around anymore. We get along better than we used to, but I'm not gonna spend any more than time her than I have to.'\nAhem... After that, Lava began to take part in operations of greater importance, becoming a powerful and dependable Caster.\nWe must take care to not underestimate the dangers and ploys that may harm us as we battle the many injustices in our world. This applies not only to Lava, but also Rhodes Island as a whole. Both have faced many seemingly unsurmountable dangers, and often sacrifices had to be made. During the ■■■■ Incident—\n[Log Partially Missing]\n—Having worked together for so long, this was undoubtedly the most difficult part of the whole incident to those teammates. After the ■■■■ Incident, it was as though Lava became a mature, full-grown adult in the span of a night, having learned to remain calm when it's time to part ways and to treasure the moments when we meet.\nI just wish that... the children who grew up in such difficulties and hardships would know how to cherish their own lives after they come to understand the pain of loss.\n[Addendum 1]\nPermission has not been granted to access information on related incidents.\n[Addendum 2]\nOut of respect for the wishes of the parties involved, access to certain information pertaining to the operator and the pertinent incidents has been restricted.\n[Addendum 3]\nCurrently, Operator Lava's psychological condition remains mostly stable.",

All we had to do was modify it to use Originium rounds, or so I thought, but Miss Cohen was pretty particular about her ammunition.\nShe wanted rounds that not only stuck to the surface, but could then bore through it before blowing up? And without using Originium Arts? Just what were these things she's been using? She said she didn't know the exact procedures to recreate them, but she could share some of the know-how behind it. That sounds wonderful!\nWith Miss Cohen's help, we were able to create a prototype of the type of rounds she described. The process wasn't really a walk in the park, but it turned out pretty well! The only thing is... the whole process behind making these rounds is far too complicated, and so we couldn't use them as regular ammunition.

In the first 100 samples, most of the ammunition lost all its lethality at a distance of 10 meters, but Tachanka said that this weapon is able to land hits at 600-700 meters. Is that really possible? What exactly is 'nitrocellulose?'\nAfter a week of attempts... a truly disastrous week, we broke a lot of things. Including this month's salary. However, it wasn't all for naught.\nClosure mixed some ground Originium powder with raw industrial ketones. After drying, this compound was able to yield ammunition with a range of about 200 meters. In order to fire this ammunition normally, we modified the bore and receiver of the heavy gun and replaced it with a large-caliber gun tube. After several further rounds of modification... at least we can say that we attained satisfactory results at last.\nTachanka was overjoyed, and the feeling was mutual.

But this Elliot, a young research assistant of Columbian origin, spent decades transforming himself into a man of Sargon. He has cultivated contacts, wealth, and power in the Ibut region. His unique black market brought local nobles and foreign businessmen alike into his orbit. And after getting his revenge, all that he built over twenty years, he simply discarded.\nA black marketeer, starting as a lowly assistant, rose to prominence, and gave it all up in an instant. He could have lived like the Lord Ameer of Ibut after getting his revenge. This has some in HR worried about Elliot's intentions after changing his name and coming to Rhodes Island.\nWhen pressed on this point, Elliot, Operator Passenger himself, shot a hole through our doubts.

But after meeting a target from the Engineering Department or returning victorious from a mission, there is no emotional change in his eyes at all.\nHe does not keep secrets, except for the most crucial ones. He describes his experiences and current situation clearly and concisely to anyone who asks, as if he has the speech memorized. Not everyone can face his past with such an attitude. After the fire that brought his revenge to completion, he felt relief, but what was to come next? Where does he go after leaving behind the golden sands of Sargon?\nPassenger once described Dr. Kal'tsit as his savior. Though I never saw a hint of gratitude in his trademark smile as he said it. He clearly trusts Dr. Kal'tsit on some level, and if Kal'tsit never said another word about how they met in Sargon, he would never share anything personal about her.\nAs for Sesa, Passenger is dangerously concerned with Sesa. Only a very few people, including the Doctor, know that Sesa is investigating a certain Columbian military contractor. Unfortunately, Sesa's 'incomplete revenge' fits all the elements of Passenger's attention. He is even eager to help Sesa piece together the truth. If it were not for the limitations placed on Rhodes Island Operators, it is hard to imagine what Sesa and Passenger might be able to exact on that Columbian corporation.\nThe main reason why Passenger has not acted more rashly thus far is the Doctor. No matter what his feelings toward the Doctor may be, his primary interest seems to be in actions and accomplishments. He may feel some kinship with the Doctor over their unique life experiences, or he may find comfort in having a commander to give him orders and direction. Either way, we will watch this development carefully.\nAs he said, he left Columbia, he left Sargon, and now he is at Rhodes Island. Wherever he is in the world, he is but a passenger—an outsider, along for the ride.",

Though we couldn't understand why they chose to send her to Rhodes Island for an ordinary display of hypoglycemia, and why they sent all her private belongings along with her, we chose to err on the humanitarian side and administer basic treatment, at which point we discovered her Oripathy symptoms. After inquiring again with her relatives, we confirmed that Miss Blodeuwedd's Oripathy had manifested since long ago, simply because she'd gotten so lost in fiddling with her 'toys,' often shutting herself in her room for such lengths that her relatives never noticed any hint she'd caught Oripathy until her mother felt something was awry, burst through her door with friends and family in tow, and finally found that her own daughter had been improperly using industrial Originium products for so long that she'd caught Oripathy and fallen unconscious at that. Introduced by a relative, they drove all night to send her to Rhodes Island, which was passing by not too far away. After a simple discussion, we took her in as a patient.",

              "storyText": "Following appropriate care, Miss Blodeuwedd very quickly regained consciousness. Her first point of order upon waking was to find her room, shoo all her relatives out of it (at the time, the five or so of them were waiting for her recovery in a room prepared for her), and get back to her works. Our administrative and medical staff felt this was confounding behavior, but Miss Blodeuwedd's Vouivran relatives seemed to be used to it. 'That's my daughter for you,' her mother stated. It followed a deeper investigation that we learned, each Vouivre of the group, temperamental by all rights had been beaten into submission after entering Miss Blodeuwedd's room without permission. Once her mother recounted this, she declared with half-embarrassment, half-pride that her girl had the best punches of their entire Vouivran generation. While we conversed, Miss Blodeuwedd had finished her own creation—a portable siege crossbow, which couldn't be carried out owing to the Operator dormitory doors being too narrow, so... with great ease... she broke through a part of the wall... Gossip says that an admin Operator on the scene very nearly called in our field Operators to take over the affair.\nIt's fortunate that Miss Blodeuwedd only took the crossbow out, and the corridor could completely fit her along with her weapon.\nAfter that, we held a serious discussion with her, and she seemed to very quickly accept her present situation, but held no concern for our arrangements, her demands being very simple: once her illness was stable, let her get back into her home workshop, and back into her hobby, and if her illness got worse again, she'd come back here to get treated. Her attitude made administering her treatment greatly difficult for us, and in the end, the administrative Operators had no ideas either, so the best we could do was tour Miss Blodeuwedd around the areas catered to those staying aboard the Rhodes Island landship.\nOf course, we all know Miss Blodeuwedd is now a Rhodes Island employee; this total change of heart is completely owed to the work environment Rhodes Island built for its craftsmen, and a few experienced craftsman Operators. She had ample interest in our workshop facilities and said Operators, and went nowhere else afterwards, instead chatting with our craftsmen. Afterwards, Miss Blodeuwedd directly applied for Rhodes Island craftsmanship... with an Operator. Without a doubt, she had qualities that would make her a fine Operator, but we desired that if she became one, she would comply with our relevant regulations, which she very readily agreed to, even picking a codename for herself on the spot—Toddifons.\n\n'Some people asked me before how Toddifons woke up, grasped her situation and made straight for the room with all her relatives and personal belongings. You wonder? Just look at her background and it'll make sense. There's a lot she can understand with a single glance, it's just that she doesn't care. She takes things as her temper tells her.

Following her becoming an Operator, on the very day she gained employment, she unprecedentedly took two days off and took to the streets of a then-nearby Victorian city. After two days, multiple cosmetics and two great big bags of clothes had found their way to her dormitory—one of work clothes, only worn for entering the workshop; the other was entirely trendy fashion which Toddifons had matched with some odds and ends, becoming the most frequent attire we saw her in, and immediately afterwards, the attire she wore to the battlefield. Our admin Operator in charge of managing fieldwork always seemed put out of sorts by Toddifons wearing such exquisite clothing on the battlefield, trying to raise countless lines of reasoning: the enemy might notice colors too bright, it'll affect the whole team's ambience, so on. All were rejected soundly by a 'none of your business' from Toddifons. In the end, to settle the matter, the two employed the time-proven, most effective method of resolving conflicts—they had a fight.\nOur beloved admin Operator lost very decisively. In two seconds? Three, maybe? He got dunked on the ground, and from then on wouldn't even raise his head when speaking with Toddifons.\nWe can't blame him, though; before consulting her records, neither did we know that this girl who never saw eye-to-eye with orders was once a Cyr Military College student. Though reputation-wise the school is far from level with the Victorian Royal Guard, it still stands as one of the endorsed military colleges in Victoria's borders. Toddifons studied as a specialist combat force unit, her first-year report outstanding. The College's instructors had already picked up on her temperamental flaws, but still intended to have her focus on her education, believing their decades of experience could rein in the self-ruling Vouivre. Unfortunately, once the second year revealed artillery and siege courses to her, all the old boffins' efforts were very quickly and neatly dashed. During her second year, Toddifons suggested she change to the siege artillery course, which the instructors decisively refused, and after multiple statements of 'if you won't let me take it, then I quit' did nothing, Toddifons spent three months in the library, studying through her entire preferred course solo, and then bluntly submitted her withdrawal application at her final exam. While the instructors still thought to negotiate with her, she had long since left the college, and returned back home.\n\n'It's actually very easy to figure out Toddifons' disposition. She might be rock-hard to budge, but if you treat her warmly, then in turn she won't be so... er, intense. But try to force her to do something? Hohoh, you're in for a treat. See, she's a Vouivre, AND she went to military school. Winning with her dukes is what she was trained for. 'Disobey does the burdenbeast who is compelled,' y'know. If you want her to do something, you'd better take it nice and easy.' —Operator commentary extract",

She even considers how to match her outfits to make even more prominent the crystals on her shoulder, as blazing red as her hair. We hold this 'open-minded' attitude of hers in high regard.\nAlright, alright, I just feel like praising her every now and then. To tell the truth, I imagine everyone who's come into contact with her before knows full well. Ask her what she genuinely cares about, and chances are it'll just be dressing up outside of the workshop, and manufacturing siege weaponry inside. Just as the records mentioned prior, Toddifons was carried here because after 'the flash of inspiration hit,' she spent too long in her room lost in research, and fainted from hypoglycemia. As best as I know, Rhodes Island at least hasn't had any 'Vouivre passing out in dorms'-type incidents, let alone by malnutrition. It's simply unheard of. You could starve any Vouivre for a month and they could still knock you flat. Odds are months would be insufficient to measure fainting by hunger.\nTo return to the records, to our knowledge, Toddifons' Vouivre tribe has been rooted in Victoria for a hundred years already, her own generation being the third of Victorian citizenship, with little separating them from the locals anymore. After their tribe's Vouivre first settled in Victoria, they principally engaged in industry. The whole tribe started a factory in unison, accepting orders from the city, the Victorian Chambers of Commerce, and even foreign business organizations. If you grew up your whole life in surroundings like that, you'd surely be able to understand why Toddifons cares especially about such vast siege weaponry—who wouldn't want to ply a huge industrial marvel to smash the warships opposite to smithereens? But in reality, using such nation-grade weaponry is beyond her ability, and so the next best thing was to make a miniaturized, portable ballista, follow Rhodes Island all over, and test its performance, give it regular maintenance, upgrade and renew it—that is what's in her capability. She knows the limits of where her class may reach, understands what she can accomplish, what opportunities aren't her own. She'll strive for the boundaries of what she can do, and the rest she'll leave to undefined, trailless luck—\n—and her own fickle good temper.",

Historically, they fought numerous battles against the Sarkaz, accumulating a wealth of combat experience. However, as times changed, the once-thriving tribe gave way to a rising new generation, what land it could control constantly being eaten away at, and once the tribe could no longer find footing in Sargon, they chose emigration to a former employer—and started life anew on Victoria's national soil. Relying on their saved connections and funds left over from their time as hired hands, they quickly found new footing in an industrial city, and used their remaining capital on opening up a factory, beginning to lead a life nothing alike the Sargon days. Toddifons' many relatives have never again taken up weapons, in their place grasping spanners and hammers.\nCome Toddifons' generation, the luster of war long since paled to that of great orders coming from Londinium, but some things carried on in unexpected forms. She still clearly remembers—a kind of aerobics only that little community was required to do, numbers of incomprehensible customs and etiquette, and the 'grounds' they set up especially for the children's 'sports days,' where none of the events bore any resemblance to regular competitions. She took it all in, and apart from having a few extra holidays, a few extra ceremonies, a few extra gatherings, and sending a great heaping pile of Vouivre her age down for the count, she doesn't think she learned much of anything. Even if nowadays, she sends Sarkaz mercenaries packing, striking them right where they're weak, she only gives the credit to her finely calibrated siege crossbow and her Fortcracker arrows, and not any precise intuition for certain targets that those bygone ceremonies and discipline gave her.\nAnd it's fair, who'd believe such a thing?",

Nonetheless, because of his lazy personality, most operators don't tend to associate him with what they consider soldiers. The fact that Spot has himself admitted to leaving the Sargon army because he wanted to get away from military life certainly doesn't help. Therefore, Heavyrain might just be a better example of a Sargon soldier than Spot.\nAnd while most people tend to forget Heavyrain's background as a soldier because of her bashful nature in their daily interactions, the moment she steps on the battlefield, her professional combat training is immediately apparent to any observers. Be it assessing the battlefield or executing the orders she is given, she is capable of carrying out the task on hand well without letting her personal views getting in the way. In Instructor Dobermann's words, 'If you're looking for a professional soldier, look no further than Heavyrain.'\nThat being said, Heavyrain is far from flawless.\nHer shortcoming is particularly noticeable when her allies are injured or otherwise in danger. She becomes fretful and anxious and displays a level of aggressiveness not normally seen in her; this further causes her to lose her calm and ability to analyze her surroundings effectively.\nThis is not a fatal flaw, as she can usually regain her calm in a relatively short period of time as long as her commanding officer knows how to work with her. Yet the problem still remains. Owing to this, Heavyrain was assigned as a Defender operator by Instructor Dobermann. Furthermore, Instructor Dobermann has requested her to adopt a combat style that is practically entirely foreign to her. That is her main responsibility on the battlefield now—To defend her allies.",

She alone was spared only to be used as a scapegoat for the chaos that unfolded.\nBecause of her aloofness, she was left without any support in the army, and she was almost sentenced to death by the military court, only finding herself spared thanks to the testimony of a survivor who managed to escape.\nThe betrayal had left her disillusioned, and, in the end, she used her accomplishments in the army to buy herself the opportunity to leave, becoming a mercenary thereafter.\nHowever, the incident has left her even more sensitive than before.

Heavyrain's introversion has hardly kept these operators from forming a friendship with her. Therefore, Heavyrain thinks of every last operator who has shown her a smile as someone she must repay with her very life, which is why she loses control of herself on the battlefield—she cares about them way too much, and she will not tolerate anyone hurting her friends.\nSuch a cute reason for someone so berserk.\nMost of our operators realize that Heavyrain doesn't know how to express herself, but they most likely have never imagined that Heavyrain thinks that, for the kindheartedness they have extended to her, she should naturally repay the favor.\nThat said, adorable as it may be, we must remember that this mentality is unhealthy. Heavyrain herself knows as well, but she evidently doesn't know how to correct it.\nFortunately, the Doctor is at the top of the list of people whose kindness she must repay.\nThe time she has spent with the Doctor since her onboarding has clearly left Heavyrain very trustful of, if not outright dependent on, the Doctor, who has undoubtedly already come to understand this aspect of Heavyrain.

This is probably your first time meeting her, though for no particular reason. This matter has little to do with any of Rhodes Island's policies, and in the past, I've simply treated it as a personal matter.\nGladiia, Skadi, and Specter are all from Ægir, and are also all Abyssal Hunters.\nMy understanding of the Abyssal Hunters comes from a large amount of data samples, and hopefully Gladiia's information will corroborate the data we have on hand.\nNot awake yet. She has slept for too long. Her body is responding vigorously to the mutation.\nThe Hunters handled the prior Sal Viento incident respectably.

You saw the information I sent you, right?\nDoctor, the Abyssal Hunters and the Ægir have long been fighting against a mysterious entity from the depths of the ocean.\nTerrestrial city-states have close to no understanding of the ocean, and likewise, have no inclination to invest their energy into investigating an unpredictable threat from an unpredictable source.\nHowever, these lifeforms are different from the rare species we've discussed before. I can say with confidence that the threat they pose is real, but not widely-known due to Iberia's decline and Ægir's isolation.\nThe few people in this room are perhaps among the small number of people on land who've caught a glimpse of the truth and still live.\nIf we fail to respond, how many people will lose their lives because of these lifeforms by the time that Oripathy destroys us all?\nThere are many calamities capable of eradicating us, and these lifeforms happen to be one of them.\nI have been wary of this threat for a long time. However, they are far from the vision of the city-states, and I am not strong enough, and my arms cannot reach far enough.\nAnd what does this all have to do with Skadi?\n...My conclusion is, Abyssal Hunters are biologically similar to their archenemies.\nThat is why Specter can combat pollutant-grade Originium for such a long time.\nDoctor, Skadi was awakened by those lifeforms.",

Sea Terrors rend the flesh of the Abyssal Hunters, as if encountering their 'natural enemies.' The Ægir language has a similar concept.\nWe know slightly more about the Sea Terrors than nothing at all, because we mostly see them when they are already dead.\nSea Terrors are the terminus of all these sea monsters, brutish and mindless.\nI'm ashamed to admit that I've never managed to catch a living Sea Terror. When Sea Terrors are placed into a small and nutrient-rich environment, their cells will stop undergoing apoptosis and autonomously metamorphose. The normal decomposition process does not occur and body tissue rapidly 'degrades,' transforming the Sea Terror into a mass of muscle fibers still capable of full respiration.\nIn other words, they quickly preserve the nutritional value of their bodies and continue to live on, yet die in an individual sense. Detestable, and frightening.\nYou cannot take them captive. If you wish to impose such a word upon them, you are welcome to try.\nWe've also made other discoveries. We hunted these lifeforms many times, and there's one thing I've seen repeatedly.\nAmong them, the individuals with the greatest physiological structure are called the 'Seaborns.' The Seaborns protect the individual organisms. To my understanding, the Seaborns will give their all to this end.\nNo legion will expose its consuls to danger, though the leaders of Rhodes Island may not observe this rule.\nThank you for pointing out my mistake, Kal'tsit. I'll be sure to use a more appropriate metaphor next time.\nIn military operations, a centurion will not voluntarily protect a legionnaire unless it is very important.\nHowever, these lifeforms are different in that all individuals are seen as equally important within the population, and individuals also see all others as having 'equal value.'\nI have never seen them fight over food.\nThere's no difference between the information I can convey and the medical report in your hand. Our science consuls can only do complete lineage tracking of embryonic cells, but Abyssal Hunters are similar to Sea Terrors and Seaborns. Most of our somatic cells are pluripotent.\nThe more frightening thing is that the somatic cells of these lifeforms are constantly mutating, cleverly avoiding deterioration and death. Does this surprise you? Neutral theory and genetic drift are a joke to them, heredity becomes part of the foundation of an individual's development, and the fundamental concept of genes passing from parents to offspring is shattered... Even in the absence of nutrients, this process can continue for a very long time.\nI still haven't described their general physiological characteristics yet, but you can already infer how disturbing they are from just the gist of things, right?\nI would like you to keep your lips sealed about the facts I'm about to tell you. No matter how desperately you try to confide these things to people on land, they will only look at you like you're crazy.\n——Abyssal Hunters also have a similar fate.\nSkadi's physiology is changing drastically.\nHow does individual variation affect the entire population? To be frank... If we did have an answer, then there would not have been a reason for Abyssal Hunters to show up on land. Don't believe me? Then, my explanations today might slightly improve your understanding of how grave the situation is.\nWhat, I didn't disclose the reason for the birth of the Abyssal Hunters?\nI have a strong urge to simply tell you 'I don't know,' but I've always loathed lying. Therefore, I will confess to you: Doctor, at this time, the truth is of no use to you except to worsen your panic.\nI wasn't trying to intimidate the Doctor, Kal'tsit. I was simply offering a sincere word of advice.\nPlease imagine that there is a rather unkind future. At that time, each sea monster is as formidable as a Seaborn or Abyssal Hunter. Their numbers grow endlessly until they dwarf even the grains of sand and drops of rain. The laws of nature we are so familiar with retreat steadily in their wake.\nThey may come up onto land, just as the Abyssal Hunters left the ocean, except the latter did not wish to destroy us. As for them, well...\nI must remind you once again, Doctor. Abyssal Hunters are extremely dangerous. We are dangerous weapons. Some Abyssal Hunters, as they approach the end of their life, will gradually reshape the ecology around them, just as the Seaborns do. This is not something that an ordinary spear or vortex spear can accomplish.\nA portion of the Abyssal Hunters' stamina and physique come from our sworn enemies, and there is only one degree of separation between Skadi and the detestable Seaborn you do not yet know. The same is true for me and Specter.\nIf the only future that awaits us is a tragic one, the fate of Abyssal Hunters can only be more harrowing than that of ordinary people.\nI've told you this much in the hopes that you'll look after Skadi. From Rhodes Island's perspective, she is different from me. You also want to protect her, right?\nAs an Ægir, these are all the secrets I am able to reveal to you, landwalker.\nAnd the reason for all of this is, we have a different connection with those creatures.\nYou might know that saying.

This is his stupidity; the other dukes would never run this sort of business in plain sight.\nHe's been embroiled in disputes, assailed back and front. He hasn't even a chance.\nIn time, yes. Gaul has put considerable pressure on Victoria in this; the frontier duke's defeat in this conflict is precisely the machinations of Victoria's strange decision-making.

Victoria—does not have just one mind.\nBut no matter what, Victoria will be too busy to concern itself with those cities stopped over in its northwest wastes; this conflict has facilitated the birth of this Columbia.\nAn opportunity? Theresa... hm. Perhaps it is. The founding of a brand new country is always an opportunity.\nBut opportunity often signifies a source of ruin. The next calamity Kazdel faces may very well be brought about by it.\nDon't joke with me. I wouldn't do such things now, I can promise you... wait, you're making fun out of me, aren't you?

No one knows what has become of Ægir beneath the ocean's surface, much less whether the other Abyssal Hunters are still alive.\n\nI am certain that the Ægirs that the Iberians took in, the 'Islanders,' that is, were citizens of the sea who left their homeland after the events that unfolded there.\nMost of the islanders are technological workers, with only a small amount of them scientific researchers. The science consuls? Leaving their magnificent, advanced homes behind was sacrilegious to them.\nThough they were mere fragments of Ægir's technological advances, using the Islanders' technology, the Iberians immediately propelled themselves from just another powerful nation into a dominating superpower... The whole of Ægir's might and technological prowess are things that the nations on land will never want to witness firsthand.\nAnd that's to say nothing of how the majority of those who live on land do not know that oceans existed in the first place.\nAlthough Gladiia remains unwilling to reveal this information, we know that the few Ægirs there are in Iberia had moved there years ago, and that's also how the Abyssal Hunters came to be. From this, we can already surmise that the events that transpired in Ægir are no mere disasters.\nThe Abyssal Hunters are undoubtedly the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Ægir's military technologies. They definitely are not Ægir's last defense. They are its vanguards and its sacrifices, as though the Ægirs were trying to test the sea monsters.\nGladiia is not one to shy away from conveying her pride using etiquettes, but she cannot hide the fact that she is also trying to conceal her anxiety.\nI can tell they have much to keep from me, and far too much. \nShe hasn't told you why the Seaborn was looking for Skadi, has she?\nSpeaking of which, the Seaborns are far from the top of the hierarchy of those sea monsters. There must be even more advanced life deep under the sea.\nGladiia tried to protect the Abyssal Hunters in her own way. She's afraid that the Church of the Deep and the Seaborns are far from the only ones who will try to do harm to the Abyssal Hunters. She believes the technology and information she holds are one of the few bargaining chips she still has left.\nShe is trying to trust us, but she remains untrustful of others. If she didn't want to help all of us fend off these threats from the sea, then she would be sunbathing on the deck right about now instead of running all around the world.\nIn addition, if an uncontrollable change is occurring to Skadi, then as one of the first Abyssal Hunters, the road Gladiia has ahead of her is just as bumpy.\nGive her a little time. The training and experience she has will lead her to make the right conclusion.\nShe is still a citizen of Ægir, but we... we don't belong to any nation out there.\nÆgir is yet silent.\n\n—Kal'tsit.",

Though there was a truce, it did not mean there was an everlasting peace. In the twenty years since, the two courts found themselves in frequent clashes, and the flames of war raged incessantly. In particular, the defected general was the target of multiple assassination attempts by the south. This general is Akafuyu's aunt and also the master she serves.\nFor years, Akafuyu led a squadron that has braved through hell and high water on the battlefield until she had a close brush with death when she found herself fallen into the enemy's trap. Although she emerged unscathed, as the commander, she was exiled by the Northern Court for the failure. She left Higashi behind and eventually found her way to Rhodes Island.\nDespite being exiled by the only master she has ever trusted, Akafuyu had no complaints about the punishment she received. She still firmly believes that she will one day return to Higashi to show her master how far she has come and to fight and bring an end to the war for her master's ideals.\nWhat Akafuyu doesn't know, however, is that, contrary to her belief, it was no mere coincidence that she received an invitation to Rhodes Island.

Had there not been any accidents, Leithanien would have been Carnelian's last stop. Fortunately or not, there was an accident.\nWhile she was taking a stroll in a certain Leithanian city, Carnelian bumped into the ruler of the territory. What's more, the Hyacinth Count, then still young, was unable to hide the fact that he was infected. As a result, she was detained, and what could have been a simple conclusion to her study trip got far more complicated.\nDespite the tense first meeting, as she started to spend time with him, the frail Leithanian count and Carnelian warmed up to each other. According to Carnelian, this might be because she was already used to dealing with kids, having helped raise her little sister, so the young count was like a bothersome little brother to her. In other words, a headache that would only turn into an even bigger headache if left unattended. However, there is no doubt now that she approves of the young count, who is in a tough situation, trying his hardest to hide his infection. Not only that, but she took it upon herself to protect him and aid him however she could.\nAs it turns out, Carnelian first made contact with Rhodes Island because she needed to discreetly obtain treatment for the count.

Those who don't know her well enough would likely be confused by the Caprinae's easygoing personality and mistake her for a friendly woman.\nOver time, as her partnership with Rhodes Island continued, Carnelian's own personality became apparent to all those who interact with her. She may seem charming and open, getting along with the other operators well, and always wearing a smile on her face, but it would be a mistake to forget Carnelian hails from Sargon. All those who fought alongside her described her with words like 'fierce,' 'violent,' and 'cruel.' The elegant, exquisite techniques she demonstrates in battle are all facades imposed upon her by Leithanien to hide her primal thirst to attack.\nCarnelian doesn't try to hide her true self much. No matter the circumstance, she does things according to her principles. Be it the kindness she shows her friends or her cruelty toward those she sees as her enemies, she will never hold back. Leithanien can never truly keep such a Sargonian in check.\nThat said, Carnelian, the self-proclaimed 'qualified big sister,' does try to calm down a little when her actual little sister and the little brother that she 'picked off the streets' are around to maintain a gentle image—Whether she succeeds at doing so is up for debate, though.",

However, whenever anyone tries to look up Carnelian's operational records with insufficient permissions, all they will receive is a falsified message that claims she is 'currently on a secret mission.' This is the very first request that Carnelian made when she was listed as a Rhodes Island operator.\nCarnelian explained that she has a little sister with whom she is fairly close. Thanks to the disruption in her study plans, it has been two years since she took up residence in Leithanien. Soon, her sister will come of age, and it will be her turn to follow the tribe's tradition and leave on a journey. Because of the restrictions that come with her job in Leithanien and the fact that she doesn't want to get her sister mixed up in this affair, she has avoided reaching out to her sister. As a result of her overprotectiveness, while she has no qualms about putting herself in danger, she fears putting those whom she holds dear in even the slimmest chance of danger.\nNow that she is also a Rhodes Island operator, Carnelian has made it clear she wishes to use this status to make contact with her sister. If her sister comes to Rhodes Island, she will find out that Carnelian is carrying out a secret operation, and once Carnelian catches wind of this, she will find the right time to 'finish her mission and come back to Rhodes Island,' so to speak, to reunite with her family.",

Indeed, it may be hard for an outsider like Carnelian to truly understand this place. While, to most Leithanians, outsiders may indeed be able to temporarily seize glory and step into the spotlight, but those without roots here will find this fabricated fame disappear in no time. Carnelian scoffed at this idea. According to her, even the most pureblooded of nobles frequently find themselves having to tread each of their steps carefully.\nShe recounted the following story to us:\nAfter the House of Hohenlohe was defeated in a conspiracy perpetrated by their political enemies, there was only a young boy left to succeed to the family's title. Unfortunately, the boy was also infected during the upheaval.\nGiven the situation, it would be extraordinarily dangerous to contact outside medical organizations or pharmaceutical companies. In the end, it was Carnelian, the girl who chose to stay behind to mind other people's business, who persuaded the count to get treatment. Carnelian is undoubtedly a careful and perceptive woman who is nonetheless honest to her feelings, and she has never tried to change this.\nThe House of Hohenlohe's political enemies or their pride are the least of her worries, as the only thing that's on her mind is the child's condition.\nFortunately, after their careful deliberation, the Hohenlohes decided against contacting massive conglomerates or organizations, instead, they picked out Rhodes Island from their long lists of companies to reach out to.\n\n[Classified Log]\nThe assistance we are providing to one side of the struggle in Leithanien has caused a rift between our members. As such, I would like to elaborate on my own personal view of the issue.\nIt has been some time since the Twin Empresses took over from Leithanien's Witch King. The country has recovered from that terror, and the nobles have regained control. We have already seen far too many ugly power struggles occur under the Empresses' eyes. It's not unreasonable that some of you are worried about our hasty decision to take sides, that it may destabilize our standing and lead us down a path detrimental to our original purpose. This speculation is reasonable, and it is of course important to be cautious and to take all necessary considerations carefully.\nRegardless, I must maintain my standpoint:\nProviding treatment to Oripathy patients has been and will remain Rhodes Island's foremost objective, and we will never abandon the patients who seek our help regardless of their status or standing.\n—Spokeswoman Amiya",

If we trust that everything she says is true and sincere, then those thoughts evidently have long lingered in her mind.

It would be a difficult question to answer.\n\nAside from this, there is one thing that we should pay extra attention to:\nWhile it is a good thing to be trusted and loved, we mustn't let our guard down.

Prior to Kirara's own unfortunate contraction of Oripathy, she had been living a proper, stable life as a student should have, her only worry about the tumult of war being whether games produced by the north could make it safely across the chaos zone, for a smooth delivery by their hired shinobi.",

At first, that's all it was.\nHowever, plans are where the little things always go awry. While the Higashi girl would shut herself in her room the majority of the time, using SMS in place of verbal dialogue, and making maximum efforts possible to avoid interacting directly with others, on her occasional 'outings,' she'd always come back having helped some operators while she was out, at times resolving some minor issues with electronic equipment, or being entrusted ad-hoc with instructing operators on how to work appliances, and once she'd even been pursued with inquiries for a walkthrough of a popular game at the time... In short, before Kirara herself even realized it, she was already on fairly good terms with our operators.\nWe very quickly sent a formal invitation to this Higashi girl, inviting her to become one.\nGratefully, fearful of strangers as she was, she didn't decline.",

In contrast to our understanding of Iberia's internal situation, Higashi's Ægir by and large have not been faced with overt exclusion, putting down roots in the country without a problem. In the present day, Kirara's own recognition of herself tells the tale—without any weight to it, she can say 'I'm just a normal Higashi girl, that's all.'\nHowever, as is plain to see, stemming from different environs in upbringing, Kirara and other Higashi operators—for example, Operator Matoimaru—have differing conceptions of many things, despite being fellow Higashi.\n\n'The north? Uh... I'm not too clued in about what Kougon's like, but I hear everyone's pretty old-timey there?'\nWhen Kirara introduced her homeland Higashi to us, she raised the subject of its two ceaselessly warring powers, each one occupying one half of the country, exerting their governances on familially unified grounds.\n'Mitsumoto didn't seem as heavily armed as the guys over there.' When regarding the contrast in power between her own home faction and the opposition, Kirara first skirted around the topic, only conceding after a while that 'if the fight started, then on a face-to-face battlefield it'd be pretty hard to win... b—but, direct conflict isn't the only thing that goes into who wins and loses! Besides, it's not like it's just war and life's on pause. When it comes to economy, openness and good atmosphere—livability, that's it—then it's us who come out on top, right? Uh, not that they're bad or anything, just, that's how I feel about it at least.'\nBeyond this, the Higashi girl also somewhat regretfully, and somewhat barbedly stated:\n'Honestly, if we could just not fight, then let's not. The past few years have been pretty good. Been peaceful for a while. Sometimes I buy games from over there and shinobi even deliver them straight to me. But after I heard about it, it seemed kind of difficult to say. Um. I'm not really sure, I don't get it much myself.'\n'I heard the eight families used to be one, but then they disagreed on something and that's why they've been split across ever since... *sigh* Honestly, isn't it kind of an overdone premise? What's the point? It's just a bunch of brothers infighting, isn't it?'",

Aside from that, music is also one of Kirara's passions; before catching Oripathy, Kirara used to have a part-time job at a bar near her home, and putting on music to fit each day's mood was one of her daily joys.\nPer her own absorptions, Kirara has spent considerable time and energy, even at times near the point of foregoing sleep and food, throwing her whole devotion into games or manga. The shut-off manner in which she refused interaction initially worried people, but as we've spent more time knowing her, we've been quick to realize that it's not that Kirara truly opposes interacting with people, but rather, it's a self-defense mechanism of sorts, stemming from a mentality of fearing being hurt.\nThis fear is closely related to Kirara's experiences as a child. During childhood, her reserved character and her interests unlike those of the children around her led to her being bullied. The experience of being ostracized still has an effect on Kirara to this day; she fears that when she bares her own soul and displays her true self, she may well be rejected or attacked, and so she has preemptively avoided contact with others.\nHowever, should you break past Kirara's inner defenses, and be recognized as a close friend, it'll be clear for anyone to see that the true way she treats people is sincere, passionate, and without any reservation.",

But one day, this Cautus visitor brought a Caprinae from Victoria who directly sought out Iris, chattered with her for more than an hour, and then applied to stay aboard just like Iris had. From her vexed, scheming expressions, it's plain to see that she's confident Rhodes Island is using some underhanded method to curtail Iris's freedom. After conducting an 'investigation' aboard that stretched out over two months, she found no evidence to support her view; our Cautus friend and Iris helped out in resolving this misunderstanding, and ultimately, she conceded her own failure of judgment. However, she did not return directly to Victoria, instead having the Cautus leave and then staying aboard along with Iris. The 'public' account is that she feels she should be of company to Iris until she fulfills her own responsibility, but the truth?\n'There are riches of toys in the playroom here, and plenty of people to play with. What's the harm in me staying for a while?' After finishing registering herself and becoming an interim Operator Caprinae—so Bena said.",

However, the way she gains trust is unlike Iris. To put it this way: Iris looks after the other children like an older sibling, while Bena plays together with the children, becoming one of them. With the help of her doll Annie, Bena is easily able to slip into the children's conversational circles, and is further able to put on an 'act' in front of others of her own volition, 'imitating' all sorts of personalities. If the Doctor hadn't punctured her 'act' the first time they met, she would be giving the Doctor a completely different character and tone of voice now.\nOwing to her consummate 'acting,' Bena is often able to 'obtain' more belongings than Iris does. That said, she's not competing with Iris for anything, only treating this as a sort of work, something she must do. Bena is always willing to do more for the Castle's long-retired 'Granny'—this is one of the few things she will readily admit.\n\n'After Bena boarded, Iris's routine with that mysterious Cautus changed. Now she takes everything to Bena first, the two of them are alone for a bit, and then Iris comes out with the things again and hands them over. Why?

Just as we'd conjectured, she is the one in charge of the preservation technique for belongings, and through her handling, the lifespans of things sent to the Castle can far exceed the original limit of their existence. However, should anyone attempt to look into details of her technique, she will make use of every childlike technique to avoid talking about the particulars, including but not limited to: dour refusal, blank ignorance, instant lapse of memory, etc., etc. Thanks to her reactions being far too amusing for their own good, some go out of their way to raise this topic with her, but anyone Bena or Annie sees through will soon suffer the practical tomfoolery of a little Caprinae and her doll together. At this stage, one can put the Caprinae prankmaster out of their mind, because most of the time, the one putting plans into practice is the ordinarily quiet, unspeaking doll Annie.\n'I'm warning you, never, ever treat Annie as some ordinary doll. She—forgive me for using 'she' rather than 'it' to refer to Annie—she can speak, think, is capable of lone operation far from Bena, and aside from clear spherical joints and a notable gap in personality, fundamentally differs none from Bena at all. Moreover, though she's reserved with speech, her curiosity is exuberant. When not by Bena's side, she'll roam about Rhodes Island wherever on her own, and should she find something interesting, she'll stay there and quietly watch, saying nothing. People are frequently startled by Annie, and some inquisitive people will instruct Annie personally. At times, Annie will be so absorbed in observation that she'll forget to return to Bena's side, who as a master of sorts will scramble about Rhodes Island searching for her doll, then finally find her Annie nestled in some room focused on something all too keenly.'\n'I know the description above might not seem too frightening. That's because I've only written about how Annie ordinarily acts. If you antagonize her and Bena, Bena will tell Annie absolutely every last horrid idea off the top of her head, and Annie will then spend days, possibly even up to months, carrying these plans out on you without a break.'\n'Believe me, you don't want to try.

We've heard that in the Castle is an age-old library, and Bena's childhood was, outside of completing what tasks her Granny gave her, spent in that library reading whatever books she wanted to. She had too solitary a life in the past, to the extent that when she discovered techniques in a book that could enable her to 'make' her own true friend, she threw all her time into it without hesitation, and the ultimate crystallization of these techniques is Annie herself. Not a single person in the Castle was surprised by the appearance of Annie; to them, 'everything in fairytales is possible,' yet she'd need an explanation if she were meeting anyone outside the Castle—\n'A doll' is the pretense Bena gives. Bena often needs to use Originium Arts and manual ability to protect Annie, and in this regard, there is no difference between her and a doll. That said, those who pay attention will note that the Caprinae and the doll's conversations seem more than anything to be another sort of 'act.' Both have long since understood the other's actions, they know the other's tastes, and making displays of communication is really just a way of relief during daily life, or to alleviate surrounding people's doubts and fears. That perspective is one reasoned through the lens of medical observation by the doctor that carries out Bena's scans. From it, we can infer that when Bena says Annie is 'another me,' she's not lying whatsoever.\n'We have queried the relevant Medical Department Operator with resulting testimony that the above speculation has no empirical evidence.

If it's daytime, the doors are always wide open for the residents, though very few residents would willingly make their way to the lighthouse. It was too close to the sea, and the adults all heard of the terrors of the sea from their ancestors, before passing them on to their children. Indigo's mother has taught her this many, many times, too. However, she was nonetheless captivated by the peculiar building. Whenever she had some spare time, the first thing that would come to her mind would be to run inside.\nThe lighthouse was where she met her teacher, a quiet, elderly Liberi who nonetheless showed the occasional sense of humor. At first, she refused to become Indigo's teacher and frequently feigned anger to chase away the girl whom she frequently found lying on the rocks next to the shore or climbing atop the lighthouse. In the end, the old Liberi was moved by her sincerity. The old lighthouse keeper needed a successor, and children who were interested in the lighthouse were few and far between. Year after year, the young girl learned much from her teacher. As she learned how to tend to the lighthouse and how to use Originium Arts to serve as its light source, she caught a glimpse of that golden age. She became obsessed with those sceneries of the past, none of which her parents, her neighbors, and her playmates could understand. Before long, she moved into the lighthouse to stay with her teacher and began to care for the lighthouse alongside her.\nOnce, when she pored over the records from those bygone eras, the girl spotted the term 'Guardian of Light.' She jokingly called her teacher one such guardian, and, upon hearing this, her teacher immediately fell silent. Enunciating her sentence word by word, the elderly Liberi told her: at this point, they were more like the guardians of the dark night.\nThe days went by much faster inside the lighthouse than the outside. After a rare rainstorm came and passed one night, her teacher forbade her from entering the lighthouse again. She told Indigo that she must leave her hometown, meet more people, and experience more things before she would be qualified to take over. From then on, Indigo has been on a journey, though she herself knows not how long this journey will last.\nWhat must she discover until she is allowed to return home?

Not long after, according to Pallas herself, she gained a deep interest in Rhodes Island during her treatment and excitedly applied to become an operator after her condition stabilized.\n'A glorious cause! The simple exterior of Rhodes Island can do nothing to hide the sincere hearts of its members. This sincerity holds true, for it shall surely turn into a formidable and solid, reliable strength.'\nThus, Pallas entered the ranks of the combat operators and became 'Operator Pallas.'

She's already become familiar with the various operators of Rhodes Island.\nPerhaps it's not just 'becoming familiar', but rather...... it's to the point of over-enthusiasm. A simple exchange of a few sentences will immediately make one aware of her tendency to blurt out anything and everything. Her life experiences seem to be the least taboo topic for Pallas. She was born to a prominent family of Minos, leading a sheltered life and resolving to become a great priestess. She studied medicine, and later trained her fighting skills to participate in the Warriors' Gathering when she grew bored. She even participated in amateur Formula Chariot racing to celebrate her coming of age... Basically, Pallas pursued a broad range of interests while keeping up with her duties as a priestess. Her open-mindedness allowed her to fully enjoy the spirit of entertainment that existed prominently in Minoan culture.\nThis carefree and fulfilling life continued until an accident occurred. Pallas's left ankle has an obvious wound, and the Originium crystals exposed by the scar tissue tell of her experiences. Pallas met with an accident while traveling during a vacation, unfortunately contracting Oripathy. By the time she arrived back at Minos to receive treatment, it was too late.\nFrom the heavy gazes of her family, Pallas was well aware of her fate. It is impossible for an Infected to remain as a priestess of the Hall of the Twelve Heroes. In fact, even the news of a priestess getting infected was to be covered up. Pallas's departure from her beloved hometown was imminent. Though her heart was heavy, she still presented her wish to 'continue her duties as a priestess in a remote area.' Under her family's arrangements, Pallas, priestess of the Hall of the Twelve Heroes, quietly disappeared from the public eye and became a nameless priestess in the remote Akroti Village.\nWhen questioned about her experiences in Akroti Village, Pallas appears to miss it greatly, telling of the many interesting things that happen in the village. For example, under her suggestion and guidance, the villagers built the Heroes' Square and began carrying out various performances and competitions, vigorously developing the local tourism industry to attract more visitors. Pallas did not go into detail about the effort or methods she used to push these plans forward, only the interesting events that happened then. However, one obstacle remained in the path of Pallas's plans to expand local tourism and culture——\nThe constant incursions into Minos by the bordering Sargon tribes.",

During the many centuries of occupation, the Sargon Lords Ameer pillaged much of Minos's resources and precious artworks, brutally ravaging Minos's culture. The Sargon colonizers were well aware that the key to breaking the Minoans was destroying their faith. Soldiers burned down many exquisite Hall of Heroes and temples, while forbidding the Minoans from holding any competitions or religious activities. At one point, even theatrical performances were outright banned.\nThe Minoans' spirit of resistance never died down. As Sargon weakened from day to day due to internal strife, resistance movements sprung up all over Minos, culminating in a grand rebellion that saw twelve renaissance leaders leading the rebel forces to victory in the 'Temple Reclamation' battle. The twelve heroes led the locals in liberating the Hall of Heroes in each city, and fully repaired each of them. From then on, the Minoans' spirits were awakened and the continually developing Minos lost all fear of the Sargon Lord Ameer's tyrannical rule, finally defeating and expelling the Sargon colonizers.\nHowever, even as the central regions grew ever more prosperous over the many years of recovery and growth, many of the border villages are still regularly harassed by some of the more barbaric Sargon tribes. Akroti Village happens to be one of them, and is the village that puts up the greatest resistance. When priestess Pallas arrived at the village, the resistance had already been ongoing for several years, but victory was often a difficult prospect and there was no actual solution to the problem of the Sargon incursions.\n'Her arrival became those villagers' hope. Everyone knew that she was a priestess of Athenius' Hall of Heroes, and this only raised their respect towards her. Not only did she proactively work to heal the villagers, she even joined in the frontlines and commanded many battles both large and small, with the intent of achieving a decisive victory over the Sargon forces.'\n'Those were not grand battles, and her tactics were rather rough, but... No matter how many times the enemy attacked, she would always persevere until the enemies were repelled. The more victories she claimed, the more people there were placing their faith in her. After a decisive victory, she negotiated the signing of the 'Non-Aggression Pact' between the Minoan border villages and the Sargon border tribes. This only further increased people's faith in her to fanatical levels.'\n'What you're saying... Could it be those stories from Minos...'\n'You've heard of these stories about the 'Goddess of Victory' and the 'Goddess of Wisdom'?'\n'So, you mean to say, Pallas is that...!'\n'Shh.'\nRegrettably, the Sarkaz bodyguard refused to elaborate further.

What she is truly concerned about is preventing the soldiers and citizens who had stood alongside her from gaining any doubts of their image of her.'\n'To maintain the status quo, the legend of a hero must not have any weaknesses that others may criticize. Pallas does not wish for the trust she painstakingly built up and the effort she tirelessly put in to crumble out of simple suspicion. And so, she willingly abandoned her identity and once again left in anonymity.'\n'But, to simply cover everything up superficially, just so that others need not accept her sacrifices and can just ignorantly cheer for the perfect hero of the story... Is that really fine?'\n'... Your thoughts are not without merit. Priestess Pallas must have considered this.'\n'However, this is the current state of Minos. If her infection were to be exposed, priestess Pallas's efforts would immediately be belittled. People are not willing to accept that an Infected 'Goddess' saved Minos. It is a terrible thing for a faithful believer to have one's personal tragedy clash with their own faith.'\n'Even so, by bravely leaving Minos, Pallas might come to find answers of her own. Her experiences on Rhodes Island will allow her to set down the burdens of her past self, and contemplate more profound contradictions arising from her encounters.'\n'Do not worry. She is both a martyr and a liberator. When she sees the rage born of those who receive unfair treatment, Pallas will surely wield her weapon once again.'\n'If she ever desires to join Rhodes Island, we should welcome her.'\n......\n\n——Part of a conversation between Kal'tsit and operators from the HR Department during a certain meeting",

Due to her mother's early death and the lax discipline of the True Bolívarians, she followed her father and grew up in the military. Because of her docile and charming personality, many of the soldiers saw her as their shining jewel.\nThe True Bolívarans is an independent government established by the locals to resist the coalition government and the Singas government. From Dobermann's perspective, their army is extremely rugged, but lacks clear organization and discipline. La Pluma grew up in this environment that emphasized the values of loyalty and rapport, and setting aside the big picture, she should've been quite happy - if not for the battle that claimed the lives of her father as well as three thousand other soldiers.\nIn regards to the specific details surrounding that battle, Pancho did not want to mention any more about it to La Pluma and Tequila, as they were not firsthand witnesses. Furthermore, Dobermann was still a part of the coalition government at the time. The three concurrent governments of Bolívar were not unified in their intelligence and they all regulated the relevant information as it could easily be used to discredit them. Therefore, it is difficult for us to collect accurate information. From the accounts of two individuals in tandem with the intelligence gathered by Tequila, we suspect that this episode was carried out to persecute Pancho, one of the heads of the True Bolívarians's hawkish faction at the time, and this persecution cost the lives of three thousand innocent soldiers.",

This inevitably reflects poorly upon Tequila as well as her surrogate father, Pancho.\nOf course, this is hardly true in reality.\nFrom the beginning, both Tequila and Pancho believed that La Pluma should be kept away from the conflict, so at least after they came to Dossoles, they chose to conduct their activities without La Pluma. However, as the three of them were still family, La Pluma would eventually discover all of these activities.\nAccording to La Pluma's own account, she gave them the cold shoulder for two weeks until they agreed to let her join. According to Tequila, this outcome was the result of his deliberation, followed by days of pleading Pancho.\nAfter all, as La Pluma's sworn brother, he knew that although his sister was obedient, her obedience was built on what she perceived as a mutually trusting relationship. She is willing to obey the words of those she relies on, but at the same time, she is unwilling to accept being excluded even if the other party was acting out of good intentions; even moreso if they were acting on good intentions, she would reject that even more. For her, sharing both happiness and hardship are most important than anything else, a mindset that may also be related to her childhood and her experiences becoming Pancho's adopted daughter.\nOf course, since she chose to join the plan, we can't ignore her status as a rebel against the Dossoles City government. Setting aside the fact that ignorance is no justification for her actions, if she simply sees her family ties as the sole criteria for the actions she takes, then she is perhaps even more terrifying than Tequila, who has full knowledge of what he is doing.\nLa Pluma is aware of this, and though she is kind-hearted, she has even stronger convictions in her views of Pancho's actions than Tequila. As a youth who grew up amidst the flames of war, she has not seen fewer wars than Tequila, and her views of war may not even necessarily be shallower than his. In fact, even Dobermann said that the youth of Bolívar notwithstanding, even she did not know how to stop war except with more war, until she left Bolívar.\nFor a young woman like La Pluma, the way Pancho did things was perfectly normal. Rather, we should see Tequila's ideology, which has become shaky as a result of Candela's influence, as an outlier.\nRhodes Island has no right or authority to weigh in on the political situation of Bolívar, nor does it intend to judge whether Candela or Pancho is correct. We can only learn what is truly happening in that land from the people of Bolívar.\nPerhaps nobody can cast that judgment, and only time will provide an answer.",

At these times, Pancho will pat her head while slowly explaining that she may not yet understand these things. She is willing to listen nevertheless, and these moments have become some of her most treasured.\nFurthermore, in conversations with the Doctor, La Pluma has mentioned more than once Pancho's disappointment as well as pride in both Tequila and himself.\nHe is disappointed that as his son continues to work under Mayor Candela, his ideals inevitably become tainted, and he can see his son wavering.\nHowever, he is proud that his son has undoubtedly matured and is doing well in all aspects, and feels happy from the bottom of his heart when others mention how his son is doing.\nHe even said that he actually hoped for Tequila and La Pluma to leave Dossoles before he began his plan, so that no matter what happened to Dossoles, his two children would have nothing to do with it.\nOf course, he may have never said these words to Tequila, or Tequila might have not taken such words seriously. Such is the nature of the father-and-son relationship. Inadvertently, they've become strangers who know each other better than anyone else.\nOriginally, La Pluma didn't plan to leave Dossoles with Tequila, wanting to stay behind to look after Pancho.

At the time, when the authorities were tipped and moved to apprehend the bandit gang, they discovered all that remained was a few, semi-conscious individuals, babbling incoherently while curled up in their makeshift dens. When pressed about the whereabouts of their fellow perpetrators, these people only stared back with horror, shouting broken phrases such as 'I don't have it' and 'Don't eat me.' As strange as this situation was, the trail went cold and the authorities were no longer able to track down the other perpetrators, leaving the case in limbo.\nNeither here nor there.

At first, the owner saw Mizuki as a thin and feeble country boy, but discovered that he was unexpectedly nimble with his hands and feet, and was an exceptionally fast learner, with an even greater knack for cooking. His savvy earned him the praise and acceptance of the head chef, and some of his suggestions to adjust the condiments and portions of certain dishes were accepted, to the great acclaim of customers. Unfortunately, the dishes Mizuki made with his own hands always went somewhat awry, and after many failures, Mizuki left this matter behind without regret.\n\nAs a matter of fact, we tried to get him to show us some of his handiwork, and well... how should I put this... The food itself was in line with his own self-assessment, the freshness and vitality of the dish's ingredients having been retained, any fishy odors eliminated, and seasoned to perfection. Yet despite the final product clearly being static, the food gave off the impression of life within it, which made it difficult for diners to enjoy... But for the more courageous colleagues who were able to try the food, they could only praise the flavor.\n\nThough I have no hard proof and this is just a hunch of mine, but — did he use some special method to lock in the freshness of the ingredients, and in the process, also fix a portion of the ingredients' 'vital force' as a form of 'nutrient?'",

In this regard, even my like-minded colleagues have vastly different opinions, and make great haste to confirm their views.\nAs for me, well, the older I become, the more confused I become, and the less I understand whether the things I've done to this point objectively move me closer to the answer. I've even come to doubt some of my original views, and I feel like I'm unable to answer with confidence— when confronted with calmly accepting one's demise, or struggling to live on at any cost, which option is true fortitude That is why I chose to go beyond the Church in Iberia, to embark on a pilgrimage, and to entrust this matter to the people that I would meet – to those people who had no choice but to make that choice. Of course, people tend to choose the latter option out of instincts, but most specimens have confirmed that instinct alone cannot give rise to true fortitude. Those who choose to swallow the contents of the box I give them in order to continue to live are easily crushed, easily destroyed, easily lose themselves. But at least they still survive, and have a healthier body and constitution that consumes fewer resources. However, these cases are not enough to answer my question — can this truly count as making their 'self' better?\nBut within the most unlikely of happenstances, there will be those like this child. Those who can attain victory through their own will and perseverance, and better their 'self.' I have neither the qualification nor authority to teach them how to continue improving in the future, as they should have their own answers after enduring their trials. The best thing for me to do is to leave quietly and wait to bear witness to their future.\nPerhaps I've long lost the resolution and tenacity I had when I first walked down this path until I became the Bishop. Perhaps the way I've explored this question has been but trickery, using deception and exploitation that cannot be refused.

This is also a result of the agreement we reached. As the guarantor and commander of this person, you are required to know more.\n\nIn fact, most of the subject's actual results on our comprehensive examination reach or even exceed the excellent mark by the evaluation standards, with the exception of Originium Arts assimilation. You should already be aware of this — yes, of the supplementary combat methods which he is unwilling to disclose too much. The methods that disrupt vision, hearing, and tactile perception, or even cause hallucinations, are not Originium Arts, but perhaps more biological in nature. Currently, we suspect some form of electrical signal or pheromone. Furthermore, the subject's performance on indices such as physical strength and fitness are likely not inferior to those of professional Operators who've undergone lengthy training, and these lofty results are just what he can achieve with his body.\nPerhaps you might not thoroughly understand what the implications of these test results mean, but I must remind you: he is not one of our operators, nor can he become one of our operators. The subject can only secretly exist as the subject of Rhodes Island Medical Department's cooperative observation project, because in all senses of the word, he is an anomaly. And from the information we already have, I'm afraid that there are at least twenty paranoid researchers permeating all corners of this world, tirelessly working for the same beliefs yet different purposes, increasing the number of cases similar to our subject - intentionally or otherwise. Though there are a few cases in which the subject has enough mental fortitude to not be overwhelmed by an overly powerful biological signal and turned into a thrashing Sea Terror, it doesn't matter if he's supported by his pure survival instinct or something altogether different.\nNow to get back to the point. The Oripathy problem is the chief focus of Rhodes Island, but humanity faces far more threats than just this, many of which have not yet made themselves visible. Therefore, we must ensure that our operators firmly stand with us, and with humanity, in facing the common problems of the future.\nAs for this subject, there are some prerequisite questions that must first be addressed. He may still have the opportunity to choose what he wishes to be, to help whoever he wishes to help, but he has not yet been able to make his own decisions. These are not simple matters, as we don't always understand ourselves correctly. Perhaps you'll be more than happy to provide him with some inspiration, or perhaps you'll want to give him the liberation of free thought?\nBefore you've found the answers to those questions, don't let him draw needless attention.

She is trying to improve in a different area.\nIn principle, Rhodes Island asks its operators to work on their existing talents first. However, we certainly are not against someone like Ch'en trying to explore her own potential when she has already mastered her first skillset.\nThat said, there was a little interlude to our weapon tuning process for Ch'en.\nPer her personal account, the firearm that Tequila provided for her in Dossoles is geared for mid-range firing. In Laterano, it would be classified as an assault rifle. Her time with the firearm in Dossoles has convinced her that this attack style does not suit her. So, after a week of fiddling and watching our operators from Laterano use their firearms, she came up with this idea—She will use a shotgun for close quarters combat and explosives for mid- and long-range attacks.\nI have to say, in a way, it's just like Ch'en to choose such a combat style. Compared to the swordsmanship that she is used to, this method of combat is even cruder. In addition, although Ch'en has a solid foundation, compared to other Sniper operators, her shooting can hardly be called exemplary. As a result, her Combat Skill evaluation on her exams has taken a slight hit. Ch'en doesn't mind, however. After all, she likely chose this weapon because she wanted a more effective way of fighting.

After all, she was always put in charge of the missions she was assigned naturally, and she always did a great job there, too.

              "storyText": "[Classified Log]\nDoctor, I have a favor I would like to ask.\nBecause of my responsibilities, I can't visit Rhodes Island often, and you are a very dependable person, so you are the only one whom I can turn to.\nIt's actually very simple, but the reason behind it is a little complicated, so I am afraid this letter is going to be a long one.\nI am certain that you already know about her trip to Dossoles. Thanks to Bolívar's unique circumstances and the political might of the city's mayor, Miss Candela Sanchez, Dossoles has become a truly unique city that stands out from its peers across the world.\nI'm certain you've noticed this yourself, but after her holiday there, Ch'en has clearly changed\nIt's been over half a year since everything that went down in Chernobog, and her trip has lasted almost just as long. I'm guessing that, during her journey with Rhodes Island, she's probably come to truly understand that she can't realize the objective she once had all by herself. But what of it? My guess is that she knew this in her heart before that as well. The only difference is that she probably didn't think the world was so terrible.\nIt was her time in Dossoles that really opened her eyes.\nCh'en has of course seen some bad things, but things can only get so bad in Lungmen when Chief Wei runs the place. Dossoles showed her that things can get much worse than she ever imagined. She found out for herself that this isn't something she can do much about.\nWhat can she do, then?\nDoctor, here's a sentence that I once read in a book, and it's fairly interesting: 'When the environment we live in leaves much to be desired, how could we say that we ourselves are good?'\nI'm not saying Ch'en had the wrong idea or was going about it the wrong way. She was right, but the world isn't nearly as beautiful a place as she thought.\nI'm not saying I want her to be like me either. As a matter of fact, I don't want her to be like me, but at the very least, I want her to at least understand that tactfulness is not the same thing as maturity, and that the turmoils of this world do not mean that everything is so harsh. She's not afraid of the shadows, but if everything is really so clear cut that they are either out in the light or in the shadows, then most people wouldn't be so afraid. A swamp that you can't pluck yourself out of is far scarier than a cliff from which you can't see the bottom.\nCh'en will need to take that step, and, to her credit, she did try to take that step this time. She consulted me on quite a few things, and I told her a few things about how I handle and view this city.\nI could tell she was pondering whether it was right to take that step, but she took it nonetheless.\nBy now, I'm sure you can already tell what it is that I'm asking of you.\nWhen an idealist finds out the world may not be so black and white, when they decide to try to understand that dark side of humans in more detail, to face some kind of fundamental problem, can they really change their mindset right away? No, they might instead lose sight of themselves. The more resolute a person is, the harder they fall sometimes.\nThis could be the only time when Ch'en's bluntness works against her.\nAt the very least, it could keep her doubting herself and question the way she did things for a very long time. You might even have already heard her mention how there isn't an answer to anything. I am sure you are aware that this is her hesitancy speaking, not her resolve. The contradiction between procedural justice and actual justice will forever torment her. No one can help her find the answer to this question, but, at the very least, we can keep her from straying off the right path.\nI ask you this sincerely. Please help her before that actually happens.\n—Hoshiguma\nThis letter was placed on the Doctor's desk when Hoshiguma paid Rhodes Island a visit.",

Yet, as soon as she returned to Rhodes Island, she spent a week writing a long, detailed report.\nHer report contained a detailed summary of her time in Dossoles, including her participation in the competition, her defusal of the crisis that emerged, as well as the assistance she provided the local police during her short stay and the lectures that she, Hoshiguma, and Swire held for the local officers to teach them how to better solve their cases. You will know everything you need to know about her trip to Dossoles as soon as you read this report.\nBut that's not all.\nCh'en also completed an excellent write-up on Bolívar and Dossoles, thanks to the many conversations she had with the locals about Bolívar, the three governments, and Dossoles as she worked her cases. This was no doubt helped by the fact she also kept herself well read on Bolívar's history, both during her time in Dossoles and after her return to Rhodes Island.\nTestament to her education at the Victorian Royal Guard Academy, not only was this an excellent, comprehensive write-up, her observation of their core problems was insightful and eye-opening. However, through this write-up, we can also tell that, the detailed research Ch'en has done has only given her even greater doubts about all the phenomena that this country and city represent. It is also apparent that she arrived at some conclusions prematurely. This perhaps has to do with that change in her mindset.\nAlthough her answer is definitely not entirely mature, that does not mean Ch'en herself is immature. Everyone has a path that they must walk. Some choose to give up before they reach the end, but Ch'en evidently is not one such person. This article is not a conclusion that she arrived at. Rather, it represents her musings, and she wishes to share her thoughts with Rhodes Island, whom she acknowledges, to work on this problem together. We at Rhodes Island are glad to see Ch'en place her trust in us, and we are glad to cooperate with her.",

It was not until Ernesto had finished taking care of his mother's funeral that Pancho Salas suddenly appeared at his doorstep.\nAfter that, his father took Ernesto away from his hometown and followed the army through Bolívar. He was sent to join a True Bolívarians prep team, receiving professional military training along with a group of similarly-aged youths. After suffering defeat on the battlefield eight years ago, the old soldier brought Ernesto and Rafaela to Dossoles after three years of drifting and laid dormant within the city, hoping to stage a comeback.\nCompared to Operator La Pluma, who is more pure-hearted, Ernesto has a substantially deeper and more complex view on many things. His five years of living in Dossoles allowed the young man to fully integrate into the city, and the ideas of indulging in freedom and the supremacy of hedonism have had a profound influence upon him.

In his spare time, he occasionally appears in the bar to introduce various wines to the other operators, finding something suiting their tastes. When a bartender is present, his sister La Pluma in particular, he demonstrates his knowledge of mixed drinks as well and introduces them to other patrons. After all, it is well known that though La Pluma is an excellent bartender, she seldom takes the initiative to talk.\nSecond, after joining Rhodes Island, he found that the company does not object to operators maintaining their own interests outside of work, and as such, he planned to continue operating his weapons shop on the ship — unlike the situation in Dossoles, the mobility of the Rhodes Island landship makes it easier to purchase high-quality equipment from various places. In front of the operators who come to his doorstep as customers, Tequila provides serious recommendations to each guest depending on their actual circumstances and needs. Furthermore, Tequila seems to have made significant inroads with the skilled craftspeople of Rhodes Island, and perhaps the modification and customization of weapons will soon be on the agenda.\n\nFrom the two things above, Operator Tequila clearly demonstrated an adept and ingenious ability to leverage his social skills, bringing his entrepreneurial temperament along with him, well-deserving of his former job as the deputy director of the Dossoles International Trade Management Department.\nHowever, there are certain individuals in Rhodes Island who he struggles to get along with, and Dobermann, an operator from Bolívar, is one such individual. The atmosphere between Tequila and Dobermann was rather tense when they first met. However, Dobermann, who hailed from the same country as him, had more convoluted experiences there than he did, and had a more profound understanding of Bolívar, ironically may have understood Tequila, who hides all kinds of complex thoughts behind a smile, better than anyone else at Rhodes Island. In fact, Dobermann easily saw through his facade and came to regard him as a young man from the same motherland, worthy of nurturing, and keeps a close eye on him.

However, Mayor Candela Sanchez saw the championship as a great boon for viewership, and as a result, granted amnesty to all the people participating in the plot with the exception of Pancho, instead removing them from their posts and exiling them, an irony not lost upon us.\nThe siblings, Tequila and La Pluma, were faced with an uncertain future, and Operator Ch'en, after great deliberation, finally decided to recommend the two of them to Rhodes Island. Ch'en believed that she was in no position to pass judgment on Tequila's actions, and also recognized that Tequila was undergoing his own internal struggle. As such, she gave Ernesto the option of trying to apply to Rhodes Island through the newly-established regional branch in Dossoles. In the end, Tequila and La Pluma came to Rhodes Island together.\nWhat must be noted is that if Ernest was the type of person who could disregard the lives of civilians in order to further his own ends, Rhodes Island absolutely would have turned him down.\nHowever, we can rely on Ch'en's pieced-together account of the incident to understand some of Ernesto's thought process. Old Pancho's plan was very difficult to execute, and in order to enable him to smoothly coordinate with the available outside forces, Ernesto, who was in placed in charge of directing the operation, had to attract the attention of the Mayor as well as that of other unexpected players. He had to instigate a certain degree of panic within Dossoles, and also needed to apply sufficient psychological duress on Mayor Candela. To accomplish these ends, Ernesto commanded his subordinates to place a considerable amount of explosives in residential areas... Ch'en's views on these actions are as follows: At that time, the residential area had been temporarily expropriated due to the championship being held, and all residents had been evacuated before the games. In theory, that area would've been the least populated place in Dossoles during that time.\nOf course, this is not to say that Ernesto's guilt should be lessened in any capacity, nor is this to defend him. However, after taking stock of the situation after the fact, we can at least make a definite conclusion:\nErnesto Salas was not interested in creating a moving heap of rubble. Nor did he want corpses strewn everywhere.\nPerhaps as a result of the wars he had seen in his youth and his knowledge of their cruelty, Ernesto did not want to become like the armies in his memories, treating corpses and destruction as trophies to be shown off.",

Obviously, Ernesto disagrees with some of Old Pancho's ideas, but nevertheless, chose to aid his father throughout the Dossoles incident.\nAs for Ernesto Salas, the turmoil of Dossoles and the failure of Pancho Salas was a turning point that helped him make up his mind. Now, the youth have convinced themselves that they've freed themselves from the will and control of the previous generation, and are determined to pave their own way.\nThis way may branch off in a completely different direction than the last generation, but Ernesto has always admitted that he belongs to Bolívar and will likely return there in the future. If there are more young people like him, the situation in Bolívar may experience new change as well.\nThis young man is trying to grasp his own destiny, and we are keenly interested in seeing where this leads him.",

I spent an age poring through reference material—I hope I haven't spelt anything wrong.'\nHer choice of spelling originates from an ancient language called Taran, and not the present-day Victorian she knows. Profile data shows that Saileach was born in a lakeside city to Victoria's south, completely unconnected to the area of Tara. Her own knowledge of Taran originates entirely from a friend local to County Hillock. Saileach tells us that in the region of Tara, on the spring festival each year, the people would take freshly budded willow branches to adorn the streets and statues. Every year she served at County Hillock, she would accompany this very friend to the agricultural plates on the outskirts, picking the best branches for the occasion, in the end completing this rather commemorative affair. Though Saileach hasn't spoken on where this friend presently is, judging by written records in reports on the County Hillock incident, the city was reduced to ruins in the fighting; it is exceedingly possible her close friend met with misfortune.\nSaileach's experiences in County Hillock have no doubt changed her outlook. The urgency she's shown in improving her own combat ability likely stems from her regret in being unable to prevent that tragedy. Good thing she did not sink into grief, let alone take to a path of revenge, but has transformed herself and taken the impetus to move forward. After all, in Saileach's choice of codename there lies the hope that County Hillock may rise from the ashes anew.",

From the moment she decided to leave the army, she never again held herself to be a Victorian soldier. In truth, she took to her new identity as a Rhodes Island Operator exceptionally well, and very quickly was proactive in throwing herself into all manner of combat/non-combat missions. She more than once mentioned the deceased elite operator Outcast's influence on her. Returning to Victoria, to her, is more of a calling. She holds a sense of justice deep in her heart, firmly resolved to spare no effort, looking to stand off against the evils that brought her such bitter memories.\nVery soon, once learning she also came to Rhodes Island, Saileach's first order of business was to find Bagpipe. The two of them had a discussion that lasted through the night, and by the next day, Saileach applied for short-term landship leave. She understands that the time to return has almost come.\n\n'From the County Hillock incident, we see that the Taran situation has already climbed to a tipping point. If their leader is not Draco, then the eruption of conflict may be deferred by a decade, but the situation in whole will not have changed.\nVictoria's centuries-old policies targeted at Tarans have made inevitable the present fires of war. Yet when we look back at history, after they were forced to split half of their authority with the Aslans, the Draco royal family, original rulers of the whole of Victoria, surely could not indulge another of their race peaceably governing a third of the country's territory. In the same manner, nor would the aristocracy—who begrudgingly shared their take with the new nobility—let the opportunity pass to press down on the area's indigenous peoples, so as to make up for losses.\nI don't at all believe that this will be a localized conflict. I can only say that this war may perhaps transform the nation of Victoria. Concerning if all this will grant us any advantage in our coming Londinium operations?

It means even more boring work's on its way.\nBut I'm thankful for my fame, too—it lets me start picking my clients, and it got me here now, living the easy life.\nYou think I've got a lot of sense? Lemme tell you how many 'auteurs' are built on sensible foundations.

There, she met the Doctor, who had left a dinner partway through, same as her, wanting to catch a breath.\nNeither moved to greet the other at first; they simply sat on different steps and stared off. After ten minutes, the door to the staircase was opened, and they both chanced to duck to the side, giving a 'shh' to each other, and upon seeing the other do exactly the same thing, they chuckled derisively.\nAfter they each returned to their respective parties, Roberta still remembered the figure who'd hidden along with her by the staircase, subsequently wandering around questioning everyone who was in the building that day, eventually managing to contact Rhodes Island.\nShe tells us her work at that time had hit a bottleneck. She thought, originally, that her own creativity had been whittled down by endless assembly line duty.

Though she moved to Columbia when she was very young, in her heart, Roberta remains a Siracusan.\nAfter a follow-up chat, we discovered that Roberta's childhood was by no means a wonderful one. Her family was based in a small Columbian town, working for a bigger family who, like them, came from Siracusa. This was not often decent work. She became used to seeing poverty, sickness and crime, and was aware from an early age that money could change a person's life.\nAfter entering the styling business, Roberta's situation didn't improve much. In Wrankwood, no one showed respect for this penniless Siracusan-blooded girl. Any random star with their fifteen minutes would be bossing her around, putting her through days in a row without even a break to sleep. She relied on her own skills, earned through blood, sweat and tears, and stubbornly climbed from the very bottom of the industry, up to its top. Money came rolling in along with the fame, but it never turned Roberta the slightest bit snobbish. Through years of Wrankwood experience, she never once forgot her old friends. But when she returned to her hometown, she found that of the friends she'd grown up with, several had lost their footing after contracting Oripathy.\nRoberta has never said it out loud, but her favorable opinion of Rhodes Island, we believe, is deeply rooted in the vision of 'true' Columbia reflected in her eyes.",

If required to serve as primary offense, her attacks are fierce and intense, but if other assault personnel are in her lineup, Fartooth will change tactics, as though she can hear the wind, seizing upon its tiniest whispers of information, providing agile and flexible long-range support to her teammates.\nAlso worth mentioning is that on first contact, Fartooth Knight's succinct and unique manner of speech led some operators to misunderstand her for a time.

Despite the prevalence of the Major and the old chivalric spirit gradually fading from Kazimierzian minds as Justyna grew up, her image of the knights wasn't badly damaged (an all-too-rare case), thanks to the Radiant Knight. When she finally met her knightly role model, both parties were far removed from where they started, but Justyna's feelings are known only to herself.\nHowever, bearing the dream of knighthood, the now-grown village girl who ventured on a journey to the Grand Knight Territory had never once imagined the utterly unexpected misfortune that might strike her. Before she could officially register to become a knight at Kawalerielki, an accident en route infected her with Oripathy, and in the time when the Blood Knight hadn't yet won the championship, it was no more than wild fantasy for Infected to become knights. Her dream snuffed out by unforeseeable circumstances, she had nowhere to go, and nowhere to return.

In the masses' eyes, past the living exception of the Blood Knight, there was no better outcome for an Infected knight than this.\nBut for Fartooth herself, all this may not have been so important. No matter if she wanted to found her own Knightclub, or agreed to join Pinus Sylvestris, it all went far in showing she wanted something more than simple fame or wealth.\nShe was now a knight. Had Justyna the village girl's dream really come true? She'd become Infected, then once again found hope, had narrowly climbed up on this thin, thin thread, but the higher she climbed, the more she came in touch with the other side of the knights she'd once yearned after. Now in the present, perhaps more than any riches or renown, more than any chivalric glory that once was her dream, Justyna simply wants to return home.\nIn her time receiving treatment at Rhodes Island, Fartooth spends most of her time on the upper deck, except when she's with her Knightclub fellows. There, she recalls how she used to work in the fields, saving the money to buy her first longbow, fantasizing about her gallant figure as she wielded it someday. She reminisces on the haystacks that smelt of sunshine, on the wind brushing past her ears, and her friends and family that would listen as she blew folk songs. Yet by the time she could be as gallant as she dreamed, she now only wanted to return to those simple, peaceful countryside days.\nWhen she sits alone high up, playing her carved recorder, she only hopes that somehow the wind will carry her flutesong back home, just as if she could return home with it.\n\nOf course, Justyna is clearer than anyone that for Infected, returning to past life is little more than a wild hope.",

She would range far from Kazimierz, fighting unlike a knight, or even a Kazimierzian.\nThe rules she was familiar with would no more be applicable.\nAnd so, at present, she is still bewildered, and still vexed.\nBut please don't worry. If you need her, she will step forth.\nJust as the ancient knight nobles of Kazimierz would have.",

Though both were Zalaks, and were born in similar places, their first time meeting came entirely by accident. Not long after the Infected Knights Act was passed, Greynuty was expelled from her family, arriving at the Grand Knight Territory to participate in brutal underground knight competitions. Right before a group melee, she first met Flametail Sona, who wanted a temporary alliance with her for the group match; Greynuty agreed. Just like that, the cannoneer and the swiftblade covered each other's weaknesses, standing out in the tumult of the melee. Once they were left alone on the field, Sona made a thrust at Greynuty, taking the points she had.\nAs a knight, Greynuty ought to have been angered, but in Sona, she found a long-lost trust and peace of mind, as well as Greynuty's own guilt towards her—Sona was once one of the subjects of the Kaliska family, but when a Catastrophe assaulted her home, the Kaliskas never fulfilled their duty as knight nobles. Ultimately, Sona's hometown fell into ruin, and she was Infected.\nAfter that, Greynuty, together with Sona, founded Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, competing in matches for prize money on one hand, and aiding the Infected of the Grand Knight Territory on the other. They've tried working by themselves, they've tried making deals with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi, and now, they've found an even better collaborator than before.",

She rarely participates in commercial activities, and she reads every letter from her supporters one by one in detail, writing a reply for each. When she's spotted out and about; fans gather around excitedly asking for signatures, which seems to put Greynuty at a complete, flustered loss, looking to quiet them down as quickly as she can. She then pulls the fans away from the crowd, asks in a stammer what they're looking for, and signs her name on the objects the fans hand her. Her antics have inadvertently garnered her a good number of fanatics; Sona even suggests on occasion that she ought to pursue the path of the idol knight, teasing that her prospects might be greater than as a competition knight. Of course, each time Sona says it, Greynuty sternly declines.\nGreynuty's combat ability is by no means lacking. Preeminent even in Pinus Sylvestris, many an opponent has fallen under her baptism by shellfire. However, she has her weaknesses too—heavy artillery and thick armor consume her endurance, and she moves relatively slowly when fighting the enemy in close quarters, plus the fatal gap that switching spent magazines produces. So long as these problems remain undealt with, and she doesn't temper herself as all-around as a Champion of the Major would, then there will always be a knight who seizes on her weaknesses, and she'll be unable to take the final steps to arrive at her goals.",

              "storyText": "Those familiar with Greynuty know she brims with hatred for the knight nobles. However, Greynuty once was one herself.\nGreynuty's family used to be quite well-known, but after her grandmother passed away, the elders in charge of running the family enterprise made a strategic blunder, and the whole business was left with a deep deficit, and set the family's decline in stone. It was at this time, too, that Greynuty caught Oripathy.\nAfter the fact, there was a change in the way her relatives treated her.\nHer siblings who she'd played with since childhood broke off contact, her few friendly uncles gradually fell out of touch, and her family's elders seemed to forget about her entirely.\nOne common voice held in the Kaliskas' hearts: 'The Kaliskas shouldn't have Infected. So long as Greynuty remains, our prestige will suffer.'\nIn the wake of the family's continued destitution, the way its members regarded her turned slowly from silence to anger. She'd seen how her elders shamed the estate's Infected, but never imagined that as a part of the family, Oripathy would subject her to such treatment.\nEven more unbelievable to her was that the Knight Primus seemed to want her, an Infected, gone from the family.\nIt was like she was no Kaliska, only some homeless commoner blighted by Oripathy, of a village razed in a disaster.\nThis doubt was quickly dispelled, but reality was more ruthless than her mind—she might have even lost the freedom to stay in her home.\nOne day, the Knight Primus summoned her to discuss how to resolve a certain matter. The one who passed it on was highly tactful, but she was well aware, she was that so-called 'matter'.\nAfter a knock on the Primus' parlor door, Greynuty found the Knight Primus of the Kaliskas—along with another noble Knight Primus.\nThey were presumably in talks; the atmosphere was utterly fractured, both sides menacing, trying to wrest more benefit from the other, and here in his parlor, it seemed Greynuty's Knight Primus had readily surrendered every last bargaining chip he'd held.\nThe other noble Primus flew into sudden fury on seeing Greynuty, denouncing the Kaliskas for harboring an Infected, and even bringing her before him. He tore up the treaty, and swore he would no longer work with the Kaliskas.\nGreynuty knew the other side had only used her appearance to wash himself of any blame for the ruined contract, but her Knight Primus, and her family's elders, lacked total awareness of it, going so far as to cast all their rage directly on her.\nIn the end, on a moonless night, the Primus convened a full meeting, deciding by vote whether Greynuty, the Infected, was to go.\n——It was unanimous.\nNo one present dissented; no one so much as abstained. Even Greynuty's mother and father raised their hands.\nGreynuty knew they had sorrows of their own, but in that moment, she felt her own teardrops as they ran down her face.\nThose who sympathized with her said nothing, those who detested her cheered, and the Primus sat at the head of the table feigning impartiality.\nThese were the Kaliskas, a microcosm of Kazimierz's knight nobility.\nSince then, Greynuty has left her home and come alone to the Grand Knight Territory, fighting upward from the underground arenas step by step. Through the knight competitions, she wants to recover her reputation, and thus return to that decrepit and hollowed-out family, give them a good long look at her accomplishments, make them admit they were wrong about her, make them wash off the stigma forced onto her.\nBut what comes afterward?\nSona has given it thought, but she still hasn't.",

Regrettably, before Greynuty finished this course, her grandmother laid on her sickbed never to wake again, and while her elders once solemnly vowed to finance Greynuty's studies, they never made good on their commitment.

Aside from a change in weapon-of-choice, her application of Originium Arts is no longer constrained to treatment. There's no doubt her swordspear wrapped in gold remains the ultimate deterrent to enemies on the battlefield.\nJust as her close friend Shining says, 'In the days she roamed with us, Margaret learned how to hold herself in, but upon her return to Kazimierz and reprisal of her charge, the Radiant Knight's learned how to blossom with all her heart.'\nIt's not just Shining and Nightingale; other operators who've worked with Nearl are shocked by her changes, but they all agree they suit her. Everyone understands clearly that in the application of justice to evil, so long as both reach the limit, the spotlight must shine. Immersed in the Radiant Knight's rays, evildoers are seared and burnt, while justice's allies continue supremely uplifted.\n\n[Weapon Evaluation]\nThe swordspear Operator Nearl now uses, like the warhammer before it, was given by the Nearl family to a Kazimierzian craftsman to design and forge, and has been strengthened by Operator Blemishine. It was at one point broken in a bout between Nearl and the Blood Knight, only for Operator Blemishine to mend it again.\nBy Rhodes Island's Engineering Department's evaluation, Nearl's swordspear goes beyond the strength of Kazimierzian campaign knight standard arms, making an incomparable fit with Nearl's own Originium Arts. Under ideal circumstances, it gives the Arts she casts an almost 10% increase in effectivity. By request of the evaluating engineer, Nearl obtained the consent of the weapon's designer, and authorized Rhodes Island to create a 1:6 scale model of this swordspear, residing in the Engineering Department, provided for any engineering operators and students to research.\nSupplement: Don't let Closure know how much a high-precision model of the Radiant Knight's swordspear could sell for in the Grand Knight Territory.

Still, she never refused a single time the Rhodes Island Kazimierz Branch Office sought help. In her heart, whether she's aboard the landship or not, she remains a part of Rhodes Island.\nThough admittedly, she has very limited time to stay aboard. For operators who admire Nearl, or perhaps miss their time fighting side by side with her, it really is a shame. At one point, many new operators full of hope sought out Instructors after finishing watching Nearl's Chernobog Incident battle records, mentioning wanting to learn a thing or two from this valiant operator, only to come back disappointed after learning Nearl was on long-term leave from the ship.\nIn contrast to Nearl, after Operator Blemishine confirmed her sister was on track with her undertakings in Kazimierz, she threw herself straight into the landship workshop, and spent a very long time without returning home. After several days in a row of Blemishine being unaccounted for, Nearl 'happened to' return to the landship, accurate in finding her in an experimental workshop working on the latest defensive materials, and seizing her while she was right into the middle of passionately hammering away with Eunectes. Nearl learned soon after that Blemishine had been hard at work on all-new form-fitted armor for her.\n'It's softer, and lighter, so you can wear it when you'd normally wear leisure clothes, or underneath your formal gear, and it's gotten a massive boost to defending against physical impact! I asked Mechanist and Sona to take a look, and they both said, if I just worked at it a little more, this armor would be able to block it the next time a Lazurite arrow—'\nSeeing Blemishine's brilliantly glowing face despite the circles under her eyes, Nearl didn't reprimand her for overtaxing herself, but instead hugged her close.\nBy Nearl's own request, this meeting was saved to this archive file. She hopes it'll serve to remind her that her every act in Kazimierz bears not just the weight of its manifold sufferers' hopes, but involves her most beloved family's future. The Radiant Knight now no longer launches lone charges against the great waves. She even extends her thanks to Rhodes Island, because she clearly saw the magnitude of the change that life aboard Rhodes Island brought to Maria and Zofia—'Just like when I had first joined Rhodes Island.'\n'Of course, we have to give our own thanks to Nearl! Without her, we wouldn't have pulled in such outstanding operators as Blemishine and Whislash, right? Not to mention Flametail Knight, and the whole other crowd of operators who came from Kazimierz... The Radiant Knight's personal charm really is the best recruitment ad!

The plots veiled and open, both on and off the stage, the glinting of blades from the city's tip to tail, and the blood and sweat that Nearl herself shed in the field, all recorded in fine detail in the Special Operations Records. Anyone who's read through these records, or talked with Nearl before, will have no misconception of Nearl's attitude to this competition. After the span of six years, two champions, a long and treacherous path, and all manner of hardship, the Radiant Knight of today, same as the one of the past who attempted to shatter the rules that shackled, has never recognized the honor of knight competition championship as true glory.\nHowever, in Nearl's eyes, there is another side to this farce.\n'In that arena devoid of any splendor, every heroic moment bursting forth is splendorous; in those streets lit by neon that fall short of truth, the fellowship that comes together to survive is true; in those video recordings lacking any honor to speak of, those thirsts to clamber out without relenting, to break through oneself, are honorable.'\nLate one night, Nearl wrote these words in her Rhodes Island cabin, imagining that once her friend in the City of Saplings and Artisans received this letter, they might ridicule how out of place her rare lament seemed, and let out a smile alone to herself.\nThe next day, she came across a young operator excitedly calling for 'the Radiant Knight,' to ask her her signature. The Radiant Knight's path to retaking the championship had been the focus of masses, and even Rhodes Island had its fair share of her fans. She'd keep running into similar situations each time she returned aboard, but these excited fans would be warned and kept in check by Dobermann and other Instructors most times, this being no exception. What Dobermann didn't expect, however, was that Nearl would accept that competition photograph, and wrote a line of text on the back.\nAnd this is what she wrote: 'Keep up the training—Operator Nearl'.\nIf the encouragement of her signature could inspire a young operator for a good day, then, well, whether or not they truly understood the significance of her charge at the championship, at least for that day, it wouldn't matter.",

Considering her experiences dealing with different people over the past few years, she had a clear recognition of the difficulties she did, and would soon face. In addition, her history fighting side by side with Shining, Nightingale and the other operators of Rhodes Island made her realize that the necessary amount of cooperation makes much easier work of things.\nWith the joint efforts of her and all of Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, Rhodes Island's Kawalerielki branch office was successfully established. At the same time, she set out on new work to settle the Infected. To progress her plans, she no longer operated in total isolation outside of Kazimierz society's mechanisms; on the contrary, separately with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and General Chamber of Commerce, she made collaborative strides in different places. As one of the legendary Nearls, and two-time Major champion, she had a clear and marked value at every Kazimierz conference table, just like every matter she wanted to bring to fruition, and every life she wanted to save. 'All things have their price'—the sole principle that modern Kazimierz pursues. Nearl was naturally disgusted with being shunted about as a weight on the scales, but she never minded how the Radiant Knight seemed in others' eyes. As long as she was sure, that sufficed: What she held fast to, what she brought back heart and soul to Kazimierz, were all priceless. No deals existed between her and the Adeptus or the K.G.C.C.; every cause willing to lend her a hand, she would grasp in turn, and every hindrance to her forward path, she would turn to face with swordspear in hand and no sliver of hesitation.\n'She's not like us. We'd have to look where we're going if we didn't want the wheels barreling our way. And her? She doesn't care about what turns at her. She'd opt to crash straight through it. No matter if we can't keep up, no matter if where she goes makes her presentable or not—once she smashes out of the cage, we all get to see the light coming in.' —Flametail Knight's stirred thoughts after several times cooperating\nIt's true. Without fear of danger, Nearl will forge on for the sake of a single, for a few Infected, but however many she's saved isn't her point of satisfaction. Countless idealists are ground to dust by the monolithic wheel of their times, forced to change themselves midway through changing others, but she is forever on the road, one time after another, launching her charge against the raging waves.",

This goes to show that as far as Kazimierz is concerned, the Nearl couple's whereabouts are classified to an untouchable degree.\nThrough discussion, we discovered Maria has near to no recollection of her parents, while Margaret's memories of them end at ten years old, give or take. From this, we understand that they went missing at least a decade ago. To Margaret's memory, outside of being cared for by her grandfather, she was often in the company of campaign knights. Clearly, following her parents' disappearance, the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi were considerably assistive of her family. This further shows with high likelihood, the Nearl couple went MIA in a major Adeptus-launched mission with close ties to Kazimierz.\nAre they still alive to this day? If they did give their lives, then what dangerous affair lost Kazimierz a pair of such outstanding campaign knights? Doubtless we could find some answers in Kazimierz's top secret archives, but raising this matter would have an adverse effect on our relationship with the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi.\nIf you wish, we could still continue looking into this.

It was one day when a Catastrophe changed the course of Sona's life, owing to the Kaliska knight family's neglect of their few subjects, leading to the destruction of Sona's home. Her family, friends and once peaceful life vanished like mist in a single night.

Unexpectedly, however, that city became part of the Kawalerielki Alliance, and through this, Flametail learned of another way out—Infected knighthood. It wasn't long at this time since Flametail had caught Oripathy, and she'd never gone through any training related to knight competitions, but she really didn't have all that many choices for a living.\nAt the start, independent knight Sona was thrown into a cage filled with vicious beasts and traps, and after that came an artificial jungle, and a sealed-off skyscraper. Sona realized what the Infected experienced was a world of difference to the immaculate, bright competition knights on TV—they were all voluntarily spectated playthings, and their own lives practically became the one worth they held.\nWhat definitively changed Sona actually was an official knight competition. Knight vs. knight, Infected vs. Infected. But whether Sona herself, or the Pinus Sylvestris members we talked with afterwards, no one would touch on what everyone went through during that period. However, what we can be sure of is that that blood sport of Infected knights thoroughly changed her. In the moment she held her riches and 'Flametail' title from the Knights Association high, the seed was planted in Sona's heart, waiting to root and bud.",

Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub used all the wealth they earned from knight competitions to house Infected—but in the course of things, Infected numbers began to exceed what Sona imagined. At first, she just wanted to try to unite the Infected knights, to find survival in the ruthless wipe out qualifiers. After they found their footing, they became aware of an enormous amount of Infected existing in poverty in the Grand Knight Territory, with no means to become knights, forced to live in the city's sub-levels. And the first to decide, to know she would help every Infected she could, was Flametail Knight Sona.\nShe didn't take long to go from founding Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub to rescuing the Infected of Kawalerielki. No speeches to stir the heart, no carefully detailed plan, it was practically by chance that Sona led the Infected knights to see today. She didn't come to Rhodes Island just for herself and Pinus Sylvestris's knights either. More than that, it was a hope that the vulnerable Infected they guided could seek Rhodes Island's treatment.\nThough the Infected experience in Kawalerielki is complex, the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi and General Chamber of Commerce remain in constant friction to this day. The city's neon shades and loud crowds have imperceptibly led people to accept a fact—knights are no longer what they used to be. The people have forgotten what glory the knights once stood for. And despite Sona never having truly treated herself as a knight, and never stressing any point of glory or justice, she undoubtedly, wholly fits the part of that romantic imagination of knights.\n'Sona is a true knight. It gladdens me that in the Kazimierz of now, I could still meet a fellow companion like her.' —Nearl",

However, the young, unwary Iwona caught Oripathy while training in the countryside, which threw off the path of her life. Raised for campaign knighthood, she held hope for a time, but couldn't imagine her family would immediately renounce her after she recovered.\nDespite her family's ruthless action causing her great disappointment, Iwona still resolved to press onwards. She would regain her spirits in her firm life's creed: as long as you're alive, you have to keep looking for a path to run. Iwona is a kind fighter, her passion and hot-bloodedness in battle innate to her, and becoming an Infected couldn't change that one bit. And so, she chose to become a competition knight, to achieve a knight's identity another way, to prove it for all those who'd been disappointed her to see.\nSpeed and technique are Iwona's advantages, and she puts them to nimble use, needing no theory of skill, able to respond to any move with nothing but her outstanding powers of reaction and observation, checking the opponent in one blow. Of course, combat tactics like this are a good fit to Iwona's own bodily makeup. Though the adulation of absolute power brought a sense of pressure, Iwona has inherited the family genes, along with a not-particularly-tall stature—fortunately, she keeps on growing.\n'Huh?

Perhaps deep inside, Wild Mane knew her own fated lot in life as an Infected. But in order to prove her strength, she chose to ignore these questions others would consider important, and selflessly threw herself into the battles of the underground arena. In this way, Wild Mane Knight 'numbed' herself with unbroken victory, in a perpetual search for the value of survival. However, when she finally entered an official arena, she was mocked and ridiculed by other competition knights in the lounge, and her anger gave rise to an intense conflict. It was Flametail and Ashlock who extricated her from that incident. Following her entry into Pinus Sylvestris Knightclub, she began to face her status as an Infected head-on, and approved wholeheartedly of what Flametail herself was busy doing for the Infected. To Wild Mane, having a clear objective made it a lot easier on her. So long as it was 'physical work,' she wouldn't shy from taking it on, no matter how dangerous or troublesome. And yet, the significance behind considering her actions gave her a headache. Whether the social happenings that all the booky types talked about, or the sense emblematized by her own conduct, the old Wild Mane chose to let it go in one ear and out the other. But once she'd left Kazimierz, separating from her knight identity, what new course she should take as an Infected was now, as things stood, a core question she had no way of avoiding.\nAt the very least, Wild Mane is satisfied with her current life. One certain day, she got a letter from Kazimierz, her family seemingly wanting to pass a message onto her. She only skimmed through it once, on break while training with Ashlock at the grounds, and then got back into serious training mode without any fanfare. Afterward, when asked if anything happened, she just shrugged.\n'They sent me a formal apology. Want me to give 'em a reply, let 'em know if I'm doing fine these days. Hah, I bet they saw their surname on the TV, finally remembered I existed, huh?'\n'So, Miss Wild Mane, how do you feel right now...'\n'What, me? I'm fine.

Wild Mane and the other members of Pinus Sylvestris need only be together, and they'll surely be able to accomplish much in this world.\nEven now, Wild Mane still keeps up with her former schedule as a 'knight,' each day persistently training, honing her skills. There will come a day when her power can help people, can play a role in saving lives, and for the sake of this future, for bringing hope to more Infected, Wild Mane never misses a beat.\nThere's some selfishness to it too, of course. The first time Wild Mane met the Radiant Knight, she promptly requested a duel. Even though to anyone else it was just an impolite slip of the tongue, Wild Mane was completely, sincerely prepared for it. Until the day her legs are mighty enough, sufficient to earn the Radiant Knight's approval, she'll look forward, eager, to the honoring of that appointed time.",

We have no right to reverse-engineer, and we might not even be able to.\nThis handling method unarguably elevates the product's safety and technological secrecy, and has effectively met the requirements issued by the buyers to Raythean: negate enemy equipment while ensuring enemy forces can be captured alive and intact.",

Contrary to what many of us imagined, it's more often devoted to anti-corrosion tech and raising of product lifespan and reliability. Moreover, things aren't as cut-and-dry as that.\n'Raythean Industries—no... any firm that receives orders for arms or equipment has to consider the issue of product durability, but no company would outright attempt research of anything 'long-lasting' or 'indestructible.' Granted, armies attached to higher authorities, e.g. Kazimierz's Silverlance Pegasi, don't fall under this. But in this era of rapid technological development, there's no motive for fighting forces requiring power to spend so much on custom equipment that can last for more than, say, three years. In my opinion, providing these projects with technological support is just a waste—project teams will even demand I appropriately lower the final product's durability, until it just so perfectly tips the line the stakeholders want, so they'll come and order something new next time. After running into these requirements time and time again, I stopped pointlessly squandering my care on those cheap things, and that, maybe, is why I didn't appeal to certain people. So it went until now, joining this 'Raythean Warbreaker' R&D team.'\nWhat Operator Corroserum brought up here seemed far from under any strict NDA or classification, and we can assume the company had no reason to treat it as such, even if Rhodes Island has hit walls running into similar problems throughout its medical manufacturing pipeline and sales fronts. After all, whether in its internal or external affairs, every firm as a matter of course has its troubles and schemes.

She's never had any systematic medical education, nor has she been any folk herbalist doctor's apprentice. In her own words, her knowledge of theory primarily comes from an old edition of the Victorian-published 'Complete Guide to Medicinal Plants.'\nHaving such a deep understanding of herbology based on just a single reference book is of course unimaginable; however, once we saw every page was crammed full of notes in the margins, and especially when we discovered these annotations weren't just decoding and organizing the book's contents, but a vast amount were records, analysis, and even correcting the print on the practical effects of herbals, our astonishment became admiration, and we couldn't help but want to pat this girl on the head and tell her she really was incredible.\nNeither Honeyberry nor her mother is Infected, nor do they have any other severe organic disease in particular; however, Honeyberry's mother has a minor chronic illness, bedridden at times due to a common cold or joint pain—plus living long-term in a forest rich with vegetation, this was what made Honeyberry delve so deeply into herbology.\nHowever, though herbology can alleviate slight ailments, her mother's physical condition has stayed unwell, and is even declining. After a whole month with a cold, Honeyberry finally talked her mother over, used half their household savings, and went to find treatment in a nomadic city.\nLuckily, they met a specialized doctor, and after carefully noting Honeyberry's oral account of the medical history, and completing a multitude of examinations, the doctor gave a precise verdict: what was overcoming Honeyberry's mother wasn't any organic pathology, but a lasting mental pressure. He recommended her mother stay away from any sources of stress, and ideally live somewhere different.\nAs a demand, it was far too excessive for the mother and daughter. Despite that, Honeyberry, now knowing the cause, immediately switched into studying psychology. At the same time, to bear some of her mother's economic pressure, she began delivering her own resume to every firm she could find, with her own self-written herbological thesis enclosed within.\nMany companies were very quick to express interest in her. Summing consideration for work details, settling family, salary and all other various factors, Honeyberry chose Rhodes Island, and after confirming with HR, brought her mother with her.\nBenefitting from better economic circumstances, higher medical standards and Honeyberry's untiring efforts, her mother's health has shown signs of improvement.",

With his attitude of responsibility to the village, and despite his wife and daughter being opposed, he informed the village people of this fact, but was immediately expelled, even his two family members forced into the forest with him.\nAfterwards, knowing his days were numbered, he went to the village to negotiate, hoping at least his uninfected wife and girl could live there again, but was outright refused, the reason being that even if his family weren't now, they might become Infected in the future. In despair, the man came home and informed his wife and child of this, thereafter disappearing into the dark forest, never to return.\nPerhaps we can imagine, supposing her father wasn't Infected, that with Honeyberry's bright mind, she could find work in some post at some mining firm's dispatch program, living a plain but stable life with her family, just like her mother once did.\nBut no matter the case, Honeyberry is here now at Rhodes Island, has proved her ability to the Medical Department, 'occupied' a tiny little conversation room, and occasionally even performs her jumping feats from high up on the deck, gracefully landing in a friend's arms—that friend is often Mint, and at times, the Doctor too.",

'filthy Infected family' and the like—her health got worse, and my dream got a little more practical: I wanted to become the best herbalist doctor in Rim Billiton, and let my mother be healthy.\nOnce I began studying psychology, I finally understood how my mum's illness came about. Even after psychological counseling techniques helped her, I just got more pessimistic.\nIf only my mum wasn't the family of an Infected, we wouldn't have to face all this harassment and discrimination. She wouldn't be flattened by life, and she wouldn't be as frail as she is now. But, you know, how brilliant a counselor do you have to get, before you can sweep the fear and prejudice out of people's minds?\nAfter I came to Rhodes Island, I finally realized, people can't be changed by a couple hours of discussion. But the thing is, so long as you have the courage to take that first step towards somebody Infected, most prejudice can be resolved in time.\nAnd helping people pluck up that courage, take that vital first step, that's my most important duty as a counselor.\n—Oh, Doctor, don't get me wrong, no matter what the reason is, you can always book an appointment at my conversation room. No matter if it's mental pressure or everyday hassles, even if you just want to chat, you can come by!

In the course of recruiting someone to be her electrical engineering assistant, Closure went through several rounds of filtering, ultimately personally selecting this young Columbian engineer, who sailed smoothly through the interviews and joined the Engineering Department.\nThis Operator, the first day she reported in, was promptly named 'Pudding' by Closure, and is now an indispensable electrical engineer for Rhodes Island. With Pudding's help, Closure redrew the complex, chaotic tangle of engineering prints into something leaner and cleaner, and after going through standard safety tests, put it into use. Having Pudding's assistance put Closure in a position to up the power transformers' efficiency by 12%, an enormous savings for Rhodes Island's energy consumption. Thus, for her excellent work ability and specialist accomplishments, Pudding earned an ample performance bonus in her first three months, prompting a grateful smile, followed up by—a request for a whole week off, cheerfully taking her first vacation.",

While conducting an on-site survey and investigation in the country, because of her own lapse in attention, she came into direct contact with Originium matter and came away with lacerations, hence becoming an Infected. After this, she had a considerable mental aversion to surveys in the wild, and her desire to go outside decreased to a minimum. Originally wanting to continue her school studies, she turned away from higher education, instead planning a professional path to treat her illness.\nFortunately, the knowledge she gained from school and the efforts she herself made didn't go to waste. Under Closure's guidance, she quickly grasped the complexities of electrical engineering's modern technical applications, and gradually became more proficient through engineering blueprinting and base station planning.\nPudding's changed very quickly since coming to Rhodes Island, and after getting her bonus, she fully enjoyed a vacation trip to the tundra to experience a theme park for herself.",

Thus, in Pudding's dormitory, at her workbench, and even in the recliner she rests in when working overtime for Engineering, there are spots exclusively for Pillow to go. See Pudding when she's eating in the cafeteria and you'll see Pillow sitting right in front of her, and she'll be cheerfully muttering away to Pillow the whole time... that comfortable yet unique atmosphere always makes operators hesitate before deciding not to ruin the carefree mood.\nPudding's grandfather migrated to Columbia long ago, but preserved his old way of life, meaning Pudding's taken sporadic trips to live in the frigid region of Sami since she can remember. It didn't just spur her love of skiing; apparently, the icy, snowy climate bolsters Pudding's energy, as though she's back in her true, most comfortable state. To be able to lead a better life, Pudding and her parents both chose to work in the city, in modern scientific and technological firms.

Pudding isn't merely without complaint; she even actively stays overnight at Engineering, and as time's passed, she's gotten her own exclusive tent to rest in. After work, she'll wrap up in the tent bedding with Pillow and take a breather for a while. Unlike Closure's bolts from the blue, when you ask Pudding why she spends so much time in Engineering, she gives the simplest reasoning: since coming to Rhodes Island, she's gotten more chances to get into modern technical products and complex electrical engineering projects. Someone's got to be in charge of the fiddly, dull parts of work, and Pudding esteems researchers like Closure with all their experience, so she hopes she can use her own simple energies to ease the pressure of work off of everyone, thus letting them delve into even more refined scientific developments. It's no wonder the people of Engineering habitually take special care of Pudding, always leaving her workbench full of all sorts of snacks and desserts.\nAt the same time Pudding humbly expands her own knowledge and experience, Closure seems to have a particular eye for Pudding, calling her to serve as her assistant on all manner of experiments.

He possesses the proactiveness and competence to transform his ideas into reality, electing to personally lead teams to obtain any necessary materials or tools that cannot be found at Rhodes Island. And once he concentrates on his research, he becomes a precise instrument—in the several experiments he's taken part in, he's never once made the slightest mistake.\nAt the same time, he's also rather apathetic regarding life and morality. We find it hard to call this a strong point, but it must be recognized that a portion of scientists hold moral stances different from an ordinary person, and prominent figures among these scientists often make startling breakthroughs not endorsed by common ethics. Rhodes Island by no means believes that ways of thinking that fall below our standards are needed to promote advancement in science, but we are unable to deny that the purer the scientist, the more likely they are to show deviation on moral issues. And for matters relating to the Infected, this goes doubly so.\nThis aspect of Gnosis was initially the focus of a high-level investigation, since a researcher of his caliber would undoubtedly be an asset to Rhodes Island, but if he was unable to identify with our perspective on the Infected, or was unwilling to abide by our policies, then we would be forced to part ways.\nGnosis did not disappoint us.

Thanks to his firm character and skilled finesse, Olafur was quite loved and respected in Kjerag, a world apart from SilverAsh's future situation. Of course, we know by now that there were reasons that SilverAsh could not avoid this.\nIn brief, while Olafur and his wife may have been the fiends that sullied Kjerag in the eyes of some its more obstinate people, to the majority they had always been a model couple that thought of the citizens as they led them.\nThe couple's death was first assumed to have been plotted by Gnosis's father, but was ultimately ascribed to an accident. This meant the Edelweisses were not directly put on trial. However, the fact that their passing occurred within the Edelweiss domain still inspired more than a little slander. In an isolated environment like Kjerag, one tiny mistake can be engraved in the collective memory for generations, much less the framing of a great family's leader. This hounded every member of the Edelweiss family, who chose in the end to leave.\n'You want to gain as full an understanding as possible of those working under you. I have no objections to this notion, and so I am willing to disclose the full history of my family. This does not, however, mean that I must tell you what went through my mind as I left Kjerag.'\n'I made an appointment with him to meet again in future?'\n'...How could that be?'\n'However, even if he hasn't come, I will still return.'",

Is he truly the same Gnosis who bore humiliation as part of SilverAsh's plans?\nOf course he is.\nThe Doctor never actually came into direct contact with Gnosis during the trip to Kjerag, nor could we learn anything about his personality from all the files we could assemble on the various angles of the Snowcap Incident after the fact.\nWe only know that a good deal of people were discontent with his first return to Kjerag while openly using the Edelweiss name, and that following that, when he and SilverAsh jointly founded Karlan Commercial, SilverAsh defied majority opinion by having him hold the post of CTO. He reciprocated this display of trust by bringing a wide array of technologies to Karlan Commercial. But just as Kjerag didn't welcome Gnosis, so they didn't welcome Karlan Commercial either. Because he only saw the ends, means be damned, the people who worked under him, while acknowledging his talents, had many complaints. This is without mentioning the rumors that his parents were responsible for the deaths of SilverAsh's, so it mystified people that he was willing to give him such a lofty position. As they wouldn't dare question SilverAsh, the blame naturally fell on Gnosis himself.\nThis is all fact. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, his personality is still disliked by many operators. However, after seeing his unconcealed obsession with science, we can now see why he took such a dishonorable role in the Snowcap Incident.\nBecause he doesn't care.\nThis isn't to say he's the kind who doesn't understand others' feelings. Precisely the opposite; he's exceptionally clear-headed on what he wants to do, and as such he can detach himself from any other concerns.\nResearchers are often quite indifferent to everyday routine. They have sufficient mental energy to treat scientific principles objectively, but not necessarily enough left over to deal with personal emotions. Thus, a good few choose to cut themselves off as thoroughly as possible. Gnosis is clearly one of these types, and to him, the joint founding of Karlan Commercial, and behind that, SilverAsh's concern for Kjerag's future, are the few fetters that exist for him. Aside from his work, that is the one and only thing he cares about.\nAnd just as he's willing to devote his heart and soul to his research, he'll actually do the same for Karlan Commercial's affairs. Even though he'll never admit it, nor will anyone else ever understand.",

The surface has additional Columbian cutting-edge lab-developed anti-corrosive insulative coating, ensuring that in exposure to Originium-dense surroundings, the shield and related equipment still operate steadily.\nThe shield also incorporates small-scale piledriver functionality, convenient for quickly pitching camp in icefield environments. After Aurora suspended her northern expedition work and joined Rhodes Island, she modified the piledrivers into their present state of freely retractable stakes. As seen in her performance in actual combat, these steel stakes can instantly pierce a vast majority of everyday surfaces, increasing the load-bearing ability of the shield by close to 280%.\nAnother set of components attached to the shield's lower half is the 'Artificial Snowfaller.' This installation doesn't affect the local climate in the true sense; its actual function is close to a conductor channel, assisting Aurora's Originium Arts, rapidly dropping the temperature within a 3m range of the front of the shield. Most enemies are unable to bear such extreme cold, but to Aurora, born in a snowy region, the ice crystals that form in the air aren't just harmless to her, but let her feel the 'warmth' of her home.\nSupplement:\nAfter witnessing Aurora's modification of her equipment, we very much admired her. She doesn't just have a firm knowledge of engineering and ingenuity for planning, but a formidable and hopeful heart on top of it. When a healthy, robust person catches Oripathy in a sudden accident, changing their life's course, and even if they aren't discouraged by it, they often require a period to adjust mentality and accept themselves, adapting to a whole new life. Aurora, however, leapt past this step. She turned up at Rhodes Island immediately after her infection, joined the Engineering Department, spent a month talking things out with us, settled her plans, made prototypes, adjusted, officially began work, and little by little turned this originally northern exploration gear into a weapon of remarkable performance. Soon after, she took part in an immediate evaluation, and became a deploy Operator. All throughout, she never hesitated and never rested, just as if her illness didn't affect her in the slightest.\nWhether in work or in life, Aurora gave one hundred percent of her energy, and after becoming an Infected, she chose to give two hundred.",

              "storyText": "Aurora was born in Kjerag's lake region, practically spending her entire childhood on the ice. She played games of 'build-a-house' with her big brother and neighbors. They would first dig out a thin chunk of ice, cut it into rectangular bricks, and then build a small house on another part of the ice. It's certainly not easy for children to do, and they typically worked away at it from dawn to dusk. The final house would only fit three or four people, and there'd be no roof; while inside, one would simply have to look up to see the clear night sky that blanketed Kjerag. They'd sit in a circle, counting stars and cooking a fragrant, piping hot fondue. Once the fire burned out, the children would each go home. They didn't care if their little house might be knocked down tomorrow by the grown-ups fishing, because before long, they'd build another one.\nThis life didn't last for long at all. Following her family's move to Silverash territory, Aurora had to leave her playmates behind without a goodbye. Soon after, her brother who'd accompanied her day and night went with her father, into the mountain mines to work. Aurora missed her brother greatly, and ultimately, she followed him and her father one day in secret, wanting to see just what the place they worked in was like. Sadly, she quickly got lost in the bleak white of the snowy mountains. By her account, she doesn't remember how long she was out there for; it may have been three to four days, perhaps seven to eight. In the end, her brother found her in a little house she'd built out of snow. She clung to her brother's back on the descent, faint and dazed, listening to her brother tell her about the advanced machines that ran all through the night in the mines, about the future they saw as the youth in these snowy mountains.\nAt the time, Aurora couldn't make sense of a lot of what he said, but the words never left her. Some years later, after graduating from secondary school, she applied first thing to the Silverashes' talent program. She wanted to take a step ahead of her brother, travel out of Kjerag, and look back at the snowcaps from even further away. To this day, there's still a little house inside her heart, but she hopes it'll let her build even greater ones by her own hands, so that it won't just fit her brother, mother and father, but that one day it may even become a firm fortress, built for all Kjerag to withstand the raids from afar, and the coming snowstorms.",

During her time in Kjerag, this wish never became reality. Afterwards, she left the country, arriving at an engineering college in Ironforge City, Columbia. After hearing her wishes, her classmate amicably yet carefully reminded her that with Kjerag's geographical situation, it would be far from easy to see the aurora above the mountains. If she wanted to see one, she'd need to head all the way north, up to Sami. Aurora herself was very aware of this, and afterwards took the initiative to sign up to a school-organized northern icefield exploration team. Finally, on this exercise, her dream would be fulfilled.\nIn that moment, more than 'beautiful' or 'magical,' what Aurora felt most deeply was how 'exciting' it was. So the thing she'd yearned for could come true, all along, though it had nothing to do with Kjeragandr. 'I came out here with my own two legs, and so I saw it.' Aurora hasn't revealed what was on her mind then, save for that. She had been carrying the whole time, in her toolbox, a well-worn copy of 'Kjeragandr,' but we can tell that her desire to see the aurora had changed somewhat, compared to its original form in her childhood.\nTo this day, Aurora still hopes she can see it again, even as many more auroras as she can. This, in spite of her accidental infection cutting off that journey of exploration midway. At present, she's far from the icefields, far from school, and doesn't know when she can return to Kjerag, but she still hasn't given up.\nSupplement:\nAfter learning about Aurora's wish, we introduced her to Magallan. Magallan enthusiastically invited Aurora to join her the next time she went on an exploration mission in the icefields. The following request may be somewhat presumptuous: Though unknown when this next journey may ever take place, if Aurora submits an application to you, we hope you'll take into account how rare her requests for leave are, and approve it.",

What this means is she has great familiarity with both the lake and mountain terrain. We need to be prepared for the conflict that may arise. An operator who knows both sides' positions and situations well, who can provide our squad more comprehensive information, will raise our chances of a safe retreat from any danger.\nAdditionally, I'm willing to trust her.\nI'm not doubting Operator Cliffheart, or any other operators from Karlan Commercial or the Silverash territory.

I heard her footsteps, but... when some fowlbeasts perched on her shoulders, that really startled me. Who brings fowlbeasts with them hiking? ...Oh, yeah, she said she'd moved up to the mountains long ago. I was really curious how she managed to live in the mountains for such a long time. Don't you get restless being all alone up there...?'\n'Her room was filled with unfinished herbal pills. Uh-huh, she said she usually went into the mountains to collect fresh herbs, and she'd worked out a special way to make herbal pills. She blended Yanese tea leaves and local ground herbs and made a pill from it, and it had a faint tea flavor when you ate it, and it wasn't too strongly bitter. No, don't worry, it was just a pill to help with health. Hey, don't look at me like that! I don't just eat anything I see, I swear!'\n'There was a clinic in the village at the mountain's base, where she'd take the pills she'd made to the patients. The clinic seemed to have worked with her for a long time, and she'd provide them with herbal medicine free of charge... really, it really was free! Why would I be lying to you? When she first gave them medicine, the doctor had doubts about the quality. When does something just land in your lap for free, after all? So at first, they went without using any of it. It took until a doctor came across Nine-Colored Deer treating a villager who tripped and crashed onto a rock, and they saw her medical skills, before they realized they were that close to letting someone so able slip away. Yeah, the doctor there told me! Afterwards, they even went to compliment her for her medicinal knowledge and knack for treatment. And, you know, there's never enough medical resources in remote areas like that, and the fact the patients there could get her treatment really did feel heaven-sent. Oh, yeah, she barely ever gave treatment directly at the clinic, she just gave them herbal pills. She'd only lend a hand when the clinic needed the help. Makes you wonder too, right? I thought she was a little frightened of human contact, but it seemed like she'd gone through something before, and I didn't want to dredge it up.'\n'After that, I thought it wouldn't do much harm if I stayed a few more days, so I chatted for a while longer with her. She wanted to improve her own medical skills, and go save more people. So I gave her an invitation, hoped she'd come to Rhodes Island for a kind of skill exchange. Whoa, the clinic doctor and the patients there really wanted to hit me when I suggested the invitation. They didn't want her to leave at all. I completely understood the feeling, so I stopped running my mouth there...'\n'After that, she spent a long time talking it over with the patients, and in the end proposed she'd come to Rhodes Island for a week or two at a time to communicate and study... I just need to go and fetch her.  Can we get her set up in my dorm when the time comes? ...Alright, I guess that'll do it. Huh? I have to submit my reason for overstaying there on paper? G—Gimme a sec and I'll go write it.'\n\n—A certain Operator's field voice recording",

Rescuing the dying and wounded, asking for nothing in return, those were her principles. When passing through a village just recently struck by Catastrophe, she stopped in her tracks and stayed to aid the casualties. She treated people with the greatest kindness, but sadly never received their goodwill in turn. Communications in the village had been cut off at the time, and stockpiled medical supplies and drugs were critically insufficient, more and more patients being bedridden due to lack of medicated treatment. She and the one doctor left in the village were forced to search for herbals in the nearby mountains, in order to make up for the deficiency. She firmly believed she could pull this village with nothing left away from the brink. But contrary to her hopes, rumors began spreading among the already feeble populace, and within them, Nine-Colored Deer transformed from a physician to an evil, a herald of calamity.\n'This woman only stays here so she can promote her cures, and gain our trust!' 'Look at her Originium Arts! She's the one who brought the Catastrophe!' She had to face not just the bitter cries of the sick, but the unguessable human heart. Though she never took notice of the villagers' slander,  these rumors rotted some of the people inside. Finally, a few brute villagers assembled in front of her, forcibly demanding the 'Elafia who brought us disaster' leave the place.\nIn the end, she entrusted her books filled with methods to treat illnesses, her methods for making herbal pills to that doctor, and walked far to the closest town, to inform the outside world this village still needed aid. Following that, she left that place, headed for the mountain forests to find somewhere secluded.\nHowever, the mountains were by no means always so peaceful, and the clinic at their foot always had patients in need of help. After hesitating again and again, she delivered her herbals to the doctor after all. Fortunately, this time saw no reprisal of the last.\nShe still maintains her principles, and she firmly believes, treating the heart of the people is more important than treating the body.",

Secondly—before that, her elder brother, Enciodes, had already become a Rhodes Island interim collaborative operator—SilverAsh.\nIf Enya and Enciodes' relations weren't apparent by the end of the Doctor's journey to Kjerag, then they were crystal clear by the time Kjera handed her application in. The siblings' reconciliation had already turned out as a false start. They chose their own respective positions, and hence simply acted on them, nothing more.\nAnd Enya still decided to join Rhodes Island even after knowing the basis of our and Enciodes' relationship; we're hard-pressed to believe her objective really was as simple as Kjera claims, that she wanted to give herself a moment of reprieve from the bustle of government affairs, and reunite with her sister. Or, perhaps, this truly is her mind, but given her identity, just the slightest carelessness and Rhodes Island would become another battleground for her and Enciodes' game, even if that's not what she wants.\nBut in the end, Rhodes Island still approved her application. After all, taking a step back, Kjera joining Rhodes Island as Enya's surrogate already gave rise to ties between us and Enya, and refusing at this time would be like sticking our heads in the sand. In another regard, Rhodes Island has always been capable of maintaining its own position, and as Enya and Enciodes are both willing to accept Rhodes Island's terms, acting as operators under certain restrictions, they would have to honor Rhodes Island's policy in that case. At Rhodes Island, she is Operator Pramanix, and Enciodes is Operator SilverAsh, with nothing on top.\n'...Speaking as a bystander, I'm very happy Enya and Enciodes have separately made their choices. The answers they've submitted are both brilliant, and I have high hopes for the future. But I'm no more than an observer, in the end. I'm Enya's head maid; I've seen her anger, bewilderment and tears. During the Snowcap Incident, I could say I couldn't interfere in the process of their giving their answers, so I'm not willing to directly act—in reality, if I really can't avoid it in the end, I will act to save Enya—but what about the future? Will I just fold my arms and watch then, too? Doctor, to tell the truth, I don't think I can do that.'\n'That's one big reason I came here, Doctor. These siblings make their own choices, and the barrier crossed between them will grow larger and larger, but given you could conclude the Snowcap Incident so, I trust that you also have the ability to find them another way in future.

Actually, Shalem himself hopes he'll lead this sort of life to his biological end, unable to stand recalling his past, his intermittent dreams reminding him his nightmares are still in this world. Thus, he painstakingly avoids any relation with others, hoping that he won't embroil others in it when misfortune descends.

Yes, they handed people money to seek local aid; yes, they carefully selected, adopted many children who were without claim, now their parents had vanished or been lost. Numbering one of them was the young Shalem.\nWhen Shalem and the great huddle of children first saw the troupe's tent, and were taken to their quarters in familiar manner by the butler, given bread from the old man's hands, listened to his cordial questions, their hearts were filled with a hope for the future.\n'You are children of the arts. Now, you may rest well.'\nSo the old butler promised, and so Shalem believed.\nSoon after, his life became a play.\nModest and gentle was the label the troupe gave to Shalem, and ever since then, it has become his 'true personality.'\nWe shan't dwell on the daily physical training and rehearsal of lines. Understudies as excellent as Phantom would be led upon stage, given verbal motivation and material reward in front of them all. And of course, those children not fit for the troupe's demands would be correspondingly denounced.\nEveryone wanted to be the lead on stage with the support of all, and not the failures rebuked before them. And so, on all of their shoulders sat an incorporeal burden.\nNot every child could bear this burden, and though no worries of nourishment nor sleep were had, some still had not the physical power to last upon the stage. Or, perhaps, they were encaged in a role, unable to recover themselves.\nThe children who entered the troupe together one by one disappeared, and those left were completely changed in temperament, not a speck of the innocence of their years left visible.\nAs they grew in years, Shalem had convinced himself to accept one fact:\nWe were only brought into this troupe to offer our lives to the arts. If we are unable to perform...\nThen we have no right to live within the troupe.\nWhether voluntary or not, so long as you joined the troupe, the script you were given would be written long in advance.\nTo run until your life's end.\n......\nIn his dreams, Shalem watches the traveling troupe's performances with his parents, and their performance is of a one-of-a-kind vast flood, submerging everything. Only a few survivors remain, pulling through atop the mountains. Survival drives all to the brink, and they who ought to have worked together past these difficulties began to slaughter each other.

Their digestive glands can secrete a special substance which has a soporific effect on nearby organisms.\nThe practice of catching long-snouted slumberfoots goes back a long time. After capturing them, people would extract the digestive fluid inside their bodies, separate the active agents, and create all manner of hypnogenic drugs. In the last decade, wild slumberfoots have gradually vanished from around nomadic cities, and more often than not can only be found deep in the barrens.\nWasteland long-snouted slumberfoots are docile and timid by nature, with keen hearing, quick movements, and a tendency to be hard to approach. They habitually avoid large animals, especially humans. Many merchants have thought their cute appearance suitable for domesticating into household pets, but all have ultimately failed.\nTo keep multiple wasteland slumberfoots as pets, and to successfully train them to complete multiple complex tasks, is without a doubt extremely difficult. Blacknight possesses a strong interest and extraordinary talent in beast-taming, which has led her to succeed where many ethologists would be hard-pressed.\n'A little diligence when you approach, a little patience when you mingle, a little care when you catch them, and you're done, aren't you?' When talking about her own experiences in training beasts, Blacknight comes off as laid-back, as if she were describing how she brushes her teeth in the morning.\nBased on observations, the way she and her slumberfoots interact is less like an owner and her pets, and more like a family. Perhaps, that is Blacknight's trick to raising wild animals.\nAddendum: To prevent further unintentional 'abductions,' please remind all operators to take good care of their own pets the next time Blacknight reports back to the landship.\nFurther addendum: This goes for all inanimate 'pets' resembling small animals too.",

At the time, she thought him merely an 'unjust moneybags,' and kidnapped him without thinking. The storyteller had no fear of the bandits whatsoever, even telling tales to her and her companions. She was very fond of these stories filled with accounts of Yan's sights and supernatural legends, and came to see him as an honest person, hardly the scoundrel she imagined. Not long after, she actively let him go.\nOut of curiosity, she looked into the origins of the merchant caravan after parting ways, only then realizing that they'd provoked something much larger than themselves, and only escaped unharmed thanks to the storyteller not following up on them. After that, the young bounty hunter had not just respect for the storyteller, but a great deal of appreciation too. She enjoyed both the stories he told and the name he gave her, and has used the callsign Blacknight ever since, whether traveling the country or taking contracts with Rhodes Island.\nBounty hunters are always on the move, and Blacknight thought she would never meet him again. Not once did she imagine that she'd find herself catching wind of him many years later. This time, Mr. Bai was commissioning her to go to Shangshu City and retrieve an item. Blacknight only briefly asked for details on the location and appearance of the target before quickly heading on her way. She didn't ask what significance the item had, not only because of her professionalism as a bounty hunter, but also because of who was requesting it.\nIn no way did Blacknight consider working for Mr. Bai as returning a favor. She'd much rather say it was 'out of friendship.' Though she did refer to him as 'Tianshi Bai' in her conversations with us, we're inclined to believe that she pays no mind to Mr. Bai's true identity whatsoever.

Life on the barrens, far from the shade provided by a nomadic city, is extremely dangerous. On top of evading the Catastrophes that might descend at any time, wastelanders must also endure encroachment from all manner of wild beast. Their greatest challenge, however, remains food and water. Long-term crop farming in the arid soil is practically impossible; a single gale or rainstorm will ruin any farmland with its accompanying Originium. People may be forced to starve for days at any moment. Under her parents' upbringing, Blacknight mastered many a wasteland survival skill. She can easily discern relatively safe terrain, the most filling fruits, the easiest beasts to catch, and the several warning signs of impending Catastrophes. But among all the knowledge her parents gave her, there's one thing she recalls most firmly: the most precious thing in the wild isn't water, food, or shelter from the wind and rain, it's companionship.\nClever wasteland beasts are never alone, and the people are the same. One person is weak in the face of the barrens, yet a group can traverse them. From the time she was thirteen, Blacknight led a group of the settlement's children to make a living as bounty hunters to survive. Relying on their familiarity with the wastes, they were able to take on missions that even adult hunters couldn't dream of seeing through, and quickly made a name for themselves in the region. This period of her life might seem a miserable plight to some, but Blacknight speaks of it with only pure joy, and a little pride.\nWhen Blacknight registered at the branch office, recommendation letter in hand, it was apparent that the only ones accompanying her were her slumberfoots. Where did her companions go? This, she never told us. Following simple investigation, we found out she was presently carrying a tremendous debt. Combined with her past experience in the wasteland, we surmise that she and her companions most likely failed a job, offending someone they could not afford to. As the leader, there's a high probability that Blacknight took full responsibility for it, and left the team that had given her so many warm memories to avoid burdening her friends.\nWhenever we see Blacknight huddling with her slumberfoots, talking to them or just staring off into the distance, we know that she misses her past companions. On one hand, we believe Blacknight and her partners will reunite sooner or later. On the other, we've all been very happy to observe Blacknight gradually dropping her guard, becoming willing to consider other operators as new companions instead of potential enemies. After all, who wants to step on any traps Blacknight leaves next to her seat at lunchtime?",

Not only does she speak the language fluently, she has given her slumberfoots a host of rather Billiton-style names. When she first called out for 'Drill' and 'Pick' in front of us, some operators genuinely thought she was going to be using those tools, which caused quite a few laughs.\nFrom Blacknight's own descriptions, we've found that both her parents were mine workers in Rim Billiton. Miners catching Oripathy is not infrequent, and her parents were both unfortunately infected in a small accident. Not wanting to be bound by work contract to the even more arduous Infected mines, they took their young daughter and left with a caravan headed for Columbia.\nFor the entire trip, they kept describing to Blacknight what their new life in Columbia would be like: they'd get fairly priced medicine, freedom to open up the land, and a stable, happy life on fresh soil. Even as they both became critically ill, they never once despaired in front of their daughter. Though they were unable to reach Columbia alive, Blacknight will forever remember how her mum and dad's eyes shone when they discussed their future.\nMany years later, Blacknight learned the reality of Columbia, and realized that her parents' dreams may not have been feasible. As she unfolded the map that came from her mother's hands, passed through her father's, and finally arrived in her own, she saw the marks drawn onto it one after another, plans written down line after line, and had an epiphany—what truly mattered back then was not Columbia, but the journey itself.

Aside from the standard greetings and expounding on the household's latest developments, there was (between the lines) a repeatedly emphasized concern. She was scared that her daughter, out on her own and Infected to boot, might be up to something dangerous. Especially given that she'd suddenly acquired a respectable sum of money. To lift her mother's worries, and considering Rhodes Island just so happened to be near Victoria's northern border when she sent her second remittance, she wrote a letter asking to either drop in back home, or, if her mother was just too worried, she could bring her brothers and sisters along to Rhodes Island, and the money this time would be their travel expenses, paid by Goldenglow herself.

After Goldenglow inadvertently gave her mother a shock, yet was then embraced tightly, she lost the last of her self-control and fell to pieces, crying on the spot, not at all noticing that with the whole family all clumped together, they'd completely blocked a entire corridor of Rhodes Island.\nOn returning to the dormitories, she gave her mother a simple rundown of her situation at Rhodes Island, who remained skeptical of the organization. However, thanks to how they'd been treated so far and hearing it from her girl's own mouth, a weight finally fell from Mrs. Glitter's mind, and she immediately instructed her other children to bring out the local specialties they'd brought. Since Mrs. Glitter had eight children with her (not counting Goldenglow herself!), and each one had brought plenty of gifts for the journey, Goldenglow's dormitory was practically filled with a mountain of boxes. At her earnest pleading, HR made an exception and accepted some of the gifts themselves, until they too were drowned in boxes, and all the dormitories' operators became new targets.\nAs evening fell, the riot the family created finally wound down. Rhodes Island provided temporary dormitories for its visitors, and Goldenglow finally had time for a heart-to-heart with her mother.\nAfter her daughter's departure, Mrs. Glitter had found a higher-paying job, and as all her children gradually came of age, they'd properly begun to work and supplement the family income too. Though still far from well-off, the family finally had some money set aside, and could support their daughter's treatment costs. Before leaving, Mrs. Glitter contemplated bringing Goldenglow back home—after all, the two had a deep mother-daughter bond, and she wasn't going to see her daughter suffering out there. However, after taking in Rhodes Island's practical circumstances and hearing her daughter recount her experiences over the past few years, Mrs. Glitter decided to respect her daughter's wishes, and let her expand her horizons freely aboard Rhodes Island.\nMrs. Glitter is fully aware that Rhodes Island can provide what Victoria cannot, and that her daughter is unwilling to abandon this opportunity.\nAnd so, after obtaining her family's approval, Goldenglow officially decided on her own goals. She would work and study aboard Rhodes Island, and with that as the crux, imagine her future prospects with vast, wild abandon.\nThough this land remains grey, at least what Susie Glitter sees in this moment is a clear, sparkling future.",

However, when Rhodes Island obtained her Special Forces combat history during a background check, she spoke openly about a conflict that broke out in a Victorian enclave, clearly reciting the full names of every young soldier under her at the time.\nShe made no attempt to turn away from the fact that she would go on to lose all her comrades-in-arms during the ensuing battles, an all-too-common experience. In her own words, she was already well acquainted with death, being the only healer in her hometown. She is even glad she managed to survive to the end, and was thus able to sing lamentations for each and every one of those children, sending them off in a foreign land.\nWhile she did not explicitly admit to any regrets during the conversation, before she made the decision to join Rhodes Island she displayed an extremely cautious attitude, carefully inquiring about Rhodes Island's philosophy, course of action, and what we fought for. Presumably, she did not want to be deceived into taking up arms again. As for the young soldiers, who Quercus called 'children', they had apparently taken her rallying cries to heart, plunging into the conflict with full faith. While she returned home bitter and angry, they did not return home at all.\nIn response to her frankness, the HR operator answered her questions as thoroughly as possible. However, after signing her preliminary contract, she slyly asked the staff in charge of her onboarding: 'Since you don't need an army, what's the use of knowing that I was a soldier before?'\n\nWhile Operator Quercus has been genuine with Rhodes Island, her statement also rings true. As a mere commander of a squad, there was no way for her to understand the internal political struggles in Victoria underpinning that conflict. Rhodes Island can trust her, but also needs to avoid thrusting her into certain subjects of investigation.\n—HR Operator",

Nor does any harm ever come of her fits of drunkenness; her sole offense once inebriated is improvising songs at the top of her voice. Compounded by her writing the lyrics on the walls with her tail, the inkwork unrestrained, this resembles some sort of performance art. However, compared to others who shoot giant impromptu SFX-laden movies, or who throw operators into paintings at the slightest offense, Ling is far from registering on the scale. As such, Closure hasn't placed any special restrictions on her.\nThat said, other operators show considerable interest in the songs Ling writes, copying down and collating the lyrics. Her phrases overflow with archaic flavor, her sense of meter is classical and complex, and her forms are most tastefully chosen. Her couplets may finely mesh, but the meaning bounds about without order. Her sentences vary vastly in scope, narrating at great, torrential lengths... It's reportedly a classical literary form in Yan unifying 'poetry,' 'speech' and 'essay,' and having gone through several centuries of development, is now of notable artistry. Of course, the unfamiliar ancient toponymy of Yan and certain fearful accounts within her verses, blending fact and fiction, no doubt deserve further research. However, everyone has clearly underestimated what it will take to comprehend them, and achieving an understanding of said interpretation and patterning in a short span of time is far from practical. HR has received many forms to the effect of 'We hope Ling will stay aboard the landship a while longer.'",

As for Dusk, Nian not hassling her has left her more content with staying inside her own paintings. Operator Hibiscus, a veteran at negotiations between sisters, attributed the whole phenomenon to 'the law of the eldest,' and specifically went to consult Ling about it.\n'They simply find me vexing, and no more.'\n'It's not nagging, necessarily, that does it.

Hm... when summarized in modern language, it is a question that can be no simpler...\n'Who am I.'\nHeh. Truly a clumsy, immature question! But to seek that question took us an age, and to seek its answer an age more. So seas raced and ice broke, waters in time turned to fields.

This great land did not yet bloom as it now does; all the world was a sealed kettle, yet we felt only torment, knowing not our bodies even lay within. We could not help but vie with each other... The senseless slaughter continued past all remembrance. Some fled, some slumbered, and the ones left sorrowfully awake, in the end became perplexed... And how one found the answer was down to oneself. Painting art, playing chess, sowing seeds, forging swords, composing poetry. All each to their own, all found their own happiness, and within each one's joy was their answer.\nAs to the present... We held together once the name of Sui. It is soon to awake, and Its own dream has run far longer than mine! Nian and Dusk have felt it, but Nian is too rash, Dusk's taboos too numerous, and all have their own ways about it and their own minds on it, yet we cannot help but gather in the end...

Even out of us all, she's still the most elusive one.\nRight... unfettered. She likes that word. Unshackled, free. This is my own opinion, but people have broken that word's back with ideals... plenty of which aren't realistic, yet real is exactly what she makes them.\nJust what could stand in her way? What could twist her will, keep her from going forward?\nMy paintings? She comes and goes however she pleases. Those things Nian forges—prisons? Restraints? They'd be nothing to her, she'd shake her tail and wander off just for a pot of wine.\nI think, probably, even the months and years couldn't hold her back. She dreams in millennia, and nobody knows what she's been doing in those dreams—nor who she's become.\nObviously, dreams aren't real; no need to panic. But, if she does one day stop believing in the falsity of dreams, in any of the laws of this world having meaning, then not even I know what she might become. Before our reunion in Shangshu, the only impressions I still had of her were 'keeps out of business' and 'no mind for worldly affairs.' It seems the years she enlisted and held the border, in place of our eldest brother, changed her considerably, though...\nIn short, stay somewhat wary. After all, that basket of blunders is up to no good now. It seems he's plotting something as great as the heavens, and Ling's one of the few who can deal with him... so whatever his next move is, I'm sorry, but Rhodes Island can't shake its responsibility in this.\nDon't ask me.

There, wine was incredibly sweet, wares were held precious, the grass was rich with nature's cries, winding streams hosted parties, and the sights and sensibilities were thoroughly entertaining.

Often do I revisit that city in my dreams, mountains stretching far, spring breeze ever blowing. It stood flat before the great desert, as if a lone titan... Yan's elite forces laid in ambush in distant meadows, and the city's tower gate was strung with lanterns at night, a din filling the skies, the whole city become as bait. Already it is unclear to me the number of people lost, the number more of battles fought so bitterly. Mist laid long across the desert, a lone city to hear the drums of war. The soldiers, they with their roughened faces, accents of all their homes, gazes at whistle's sound to where their native lands laid on the eve of that deathly fray, all were swallowed. Who spake that generals willed to die—old bulwarks birth new willows year on year... At the time I left the sun of Jiangnan, I had toured Yan for centuries, and felt I saw clearly through the ways of the world. I have seen all great people before, yet this world still holds sights I have never before experienced, emotions never before felt firsthand. Could you claim to know that? That day I stood upon the gate of Yumen's wall, it was only then I realized this realm was so vast.\n......\nAs for what transpired in Shangshu, you all are plenty aware...

At the same time, they also hoped to learn a thing or two from the living legend of Lungmen's street food scene. Lee has only shown off his skills at the Rhodes Island Cafeteria a handful of times, and it is not an overstatement to say that the entire cafeteria was bursting with excitement.\n'I really don't get why he opened a detective agency instead of a restaurant.

As a private investigator, all your techniques and whatnot come second. The most important thing is knowing how to really size someone up.'\nLee is never stingy about sharing his pearls of wisdom. According to him, the way Lee's Detective Agency handles its cases can be boiled down to two sayings: 'Knowledge is power' and 'give peace a chance'. Lee also claims to lack any mastery of martial arts, and his Originium Arts are even more of a mystery.\n'He said he doesn't know any martial arts and he's terrible at Originium Arts? What a load of crap!'\nAccording to a field Operator who worked with Lee's Detective Agency in Lungmen, Rhodes Island once found itself in a conflict with the local triads.

It would not have been at all strange for the two parties to run into each other during the Reunion incident, especially considering that both are on good terms with the L.G.D. Yet it wasn't until Lee realized it had been three days since Jaye last opened his finball stall, and was concernedly looking into the boy's whereabouts, that he first heard the name 'Rhodes Island' from the Rat King. That was when the two parties learned of each other and began building a working relationship.\nDuring their collaboration, Lee's Detective Agency has displayed a range of astonishing intelligence capabilities. This includes not only his uncovering of the trustworthiness and even the financial situation of each company working with Rhodes Island, but also his grasp of the occupational makeup of the downtown Infected. He even singlehandedly helped resolve the medical inconsistencies that arose while treating patients there.\nThe assistance he provides has undoubtedly been enormously convenient to Rhodes Island in its assistance of Lungmen's Infected, though naturally he is also suspicious and as such we have done our own investigation of him through other means. All the evidence uncovered by our investigators led them to believe that his organization is just your average private investigator agency, and that it only deals in minor cases involving locating missing persons, tracking unfaithful husbands, or investigating financial statuses. Of course, Rhodes Island couldn't accept this result, though it chose to maintain its partnership with the agency due to its relationship with the L.G.D.\nAs the partnership continued, the parties came to trust each other more, and Lee himself told Rhodes Island of the hidden truth about his agency that so few are aware of. He explained in detail how his agency gradually found itself having to navigate both the lawful society and the criminal underworld. Simply put, the agency's intelligence capability is entirely the result of Lee's personal network of relationships formed over the years. This implies that Lee himself must maintain reasonably stable relationships with all kinds of characters throughout Lungmen. It is not hard to imagine how hard it must be to keep a neutral, unbiased position with all the different opposing sides, let alone the ones in direct conflict with each other. At the very least, it is definitely not as easy as he made it sound.\nOn a related note, despite Lee's resourcefulness, he rarely intervenes with anything unrelated to his cases, and his agency is really just a small office in the corner of a bustling city district. As for the rumors that he is a 'kingpin of the Lungmen underworld' or an 'influential man who secretly controls Lungmen's criminal society', these are simply rumors. Nonetheless, everyone seems to suspect that he might just be able to pull it off, if he set his mind to it.",

              "storyText": "Although Lee is often called a living Lungmen encyclopedia, he isn't actually originally from Lungmen. Naturally, everyone who is acquainted with him knows about this. We've also heard Aak mention that Lee's name is actually a surname, not a given name. This particularly uncommon name is directly connected to a certain illustrious merchant family. Lee himself never attempted to hide his background, though there are also very few who know why he left his hometown and fumbled his way to Lungmen. 'It's strange. Don't most people change their surnames when they have a fight with their families? How come he kept his surname and got rid of his given name?' commented Aak.\nDuring our conversations with Lee, he very rarely used the words 'past' and 'present.' While Lee has already very much proven himself in a variety of situations, it is also true that he is exceedingly lazy with many tasks. We have met many who live in the moment to escape from reality, but it seems there is more to Lee's attitude towards life than dejection and withdrawal from society. After all, Lee is keeping his agency running, and he is also taking proper care of the youngsters who work for him. While he may claim everything to be a pain in the rear, he always has their back when they truly need it. This is why the three of them have full trust in him despite their frequent grievances. You will likely feel the same as you work side-by-side with him. He is aimless, but there is no doubt that he brings those around him a concrete sense of security.\nTo this day, there is little we know about Lee's past. As bystanders, we can only hypothesize from Lee's attitude towards others, and the look in his eyes during occasional moments of contemplation, that he might once have been a spirited young man from an exemplary background who ended up in the city after becoming disillusioned. However plausible this conjecture may be though, it certainly doesn't match Lee's own account. In the end, no matter how much we guess about his background, Lee is still the same easygoing man who jokes about how busy others are as he sips a cup of tea. Perhaps it is only when he correctly points out minor mistakes in complicated financial accounts, or when he talks about the Great Yan's history, literature, and martial arts that you will ever see his eyes light up.",

Learning all the tricks to gain someone's trust is like Detective 101... Oh? Don't look at me like that. The trust between us is no trick at all.

That's how they become part of the trap themselves, one after another. Can completely numb the enemy's senses, or alert teammates that they're coming. But not all that practical, on account of all the alarm clocks you'd need. Switch out for appropriate substitute based on the battlefield.\n\n'Invisible Warning Tape'\nThere's a lot of fun to be had with a roll of clear sticky tape. Most classic's when you stick strips all across a doorframe and lead a good friend into it. Watching them get stuck or even trip really brings a smile to your face!\nNotes: Target must however be chosen with care, and watch the mood they're in. If it doesn't turn out funny, apologize straight away.\n......\nAt first I used tactical rope, but nowadays this purpose-developed tripwire has the edge in concealment, weight and price. Based on real combat testing, this see-through thread gets exactly the effect you want, and even marries well with other traps. Gives you a level of lethality from the materials alone, and can be wound in a pinch to work as tactical rope. Considering how all-purpose it is, I should apply for a reel with Logistics next time I'm out on the field. Majorly useful.\n\n'Hollow Cake'\nPreparing this one's a pain in the rear, but especially funny. Hollow out a hole in a cake, fill it with other stuff and then re-cover. Wait for everyone's looks when they come to eat the cake and find 'something nice' inside.\nNotes: Some people don't have very good teeth, so make sure not to stuff anything too hard in.\n......\nYou're not just limited to food when you pull this one in practical combat. Kettles, cupboards, supplies. Just use your thinker, and the world's full of stuff to use against your enemies.\n\n'Me'\nMy mates have always loved showing up next to me from out of nowhere to scare me, which got me thinking: if I use myself to draw their attention, won't it be even harder for them to notice all the little shadows where I've tucked my pranks?\nNotes: People have all their focus on you when they scare you, so you'd best not make any moves and give it away.\n......\nWhat does the enemy most want to see? Me, of course. Me, hurt. Me, dead. The instructors said: 'No hunter hunts forever.' There'll always come a day when a Sniper Operator becomes someone else's prey. So why not... treat myself as bait, and give the other guy a 'nice surprise?' Right, no hunter hunts forever, but there are some hunters who'll disguise themselves as the prey.",

She also said something pretty ominous about how this is a kind of 'price' that he would have to trade his life for. I didn't want to dig too deep into that. Everyone's got their obsessions.\nWhat's really messed up, though, is that I know this gun. Back when I studied in Laterano all those years ago, I read about it in a book. This is a heritage gun. Or at the least, a very fine replica of one. I can't say for sure. It's been maintained very well. There's a high chance that the internal parts have been replaced before, but it likely isn't used very often.\nThe gun's original owner was very famous. If this is this real deal, it was once held by the saints themselves. The saint that wielded it was known for his generosity and piety. It was supposed to be sealed away under the Lateran Basilica after he passed away, but its whereabouts have been unknown ever since for whatever reasons. Until today, that is. Assuming it's real, I can't fathom how its owner found this old boy, or how Fiammetta got her hands on it, but I feel compelled to at least leave this on record.\nI just hope this isn't some kind of stolen artifact, since it definitely belongs in a museum.",

None of us could have predicted that incident, or her choices afterwards, but I still think you're a little too worried nonetheless. This isn't necessarily a bad thing. We were never going to be able to keep an eye on her forever.\nI still support Lemuen's proposal of dispatching her to the pharmaceutical company. She's proven over the last several years that she can take care of most things herself. The best way to assuage your worries would be to give her greater support and a reliable guardian angel. Don't forget. She overcame her racial handicap and became a Gun-Knight candidate solely because she's one of our finest students. We should trust in her, and I hope you can reconsider and retract your opinion.\nYou should rejoice. We would've let her parents down if she'd grown up the way Laterano had intended. We must repay that favor, of course, but not this way. Give her time. She will surprise us both. We're old, and she's still young.\nAlso, you should pick her next codename. Something badass.

Consisting of four of Laterano's elites, this tactical squad should've easily completed its objective. They followed the trail left behind by the bandits and tracked them down to the remnants of a building. The bandits were clearly using the ruins as a bunker, or perhaps some kind of defensive structure. Yet the team was unable to find any sign of the enemy there. The place was much more eerie than they expected. There were a large number of corpses present, at various stages of decay. The bodies were all in front of a sealed door, as though they came seeking something, only to never find the answer they sought. The deceased were of different races, ages, and even eras, but they all had one thing in common. In Fiammetta's words, 'They were all frozen in their own moment in time.'\nThere isn't a reliable report as to what happened afterwards. Fiammetta herself claims to have left the scene because of a fake transmission—later found to be a trap set by the bandits—and therefore wasn't present at the crucial moment when events unfolded. What we do know is that squad member Lemuen was bedridden in the hospital until recently, while Mostima became a fallen angel and left Laterano, followed by Fiammetta herself. Relevant intelligence suggests that the squad was led by a Sankta named Andoain at the time, but no information on such a person is contained in any official Lateran documents.\n[Classified Log]\nThere is a rumor that once circulated among the gossip peddlers of Kazdel: somewhere in the barrenlands, there is someone who has exceptional insight into the past and future. His forbidden power and knowledge can guide you beyond the door of the truth, so long as you can pay the price.\nAfter a certain point, this rumor abruptly stopped being spread. Evidence suggests that its source was very likely a certain Sarkaz gang that was suddenly annihilated.",

At a classic movie night held by Nian, Lava, and Robin, Fiammetta—who was just passing by—had some really strong criticisms and unkind words for these movies. Still, it was pretty obvious from the conversation that she had a deep understanding of the genre and had seen an impressive number of films. Her disdainful insight into these trashy films is on another level. She could be complaining about how this kind of cultural filth is having an immeasurable negative influence on people's taste one minute, then reciting classic movie lines the next.

Though she'd entertained the idea that coping with hopeless days like these wouldn't kill her per se, there came a day when the wind blew over a flowerpot on her way home from work, and she completely failed to detect or dodge it in time.

After a whole night discussing her objections with the household, she proposed her own idea to the head, and the young lord gladly gave his consent.

She herself undertook training from the age of five, and the merciless and peculiar-sounding exercises helped her to fulfill mission after mission with flying colors.

Maybe even work out a thing or two in the fashion field.

Of course, not a word of the discussion can be clearly made out.\nConversely, Rhodes Island's children eagerly anticipate such days, for the nice Feline who can make paper things run and fly is about to bring them origami toys more novel than ever.\nThe truth is that Kazemaru isn't playing along with these children of her own initiative; her identity and training up till now wouldn't permit her to do so. But by chance, after the children found out her origami could move, they hounded her, pleading her to teach them how.\nThough she was initially flustered by this, she was quick to brandish her mastery, rapidly taking on the role of a close, big-sister-type friend to the children, a dedicated origami expert, sweets-lover, and enthusiast of play. However, while Kazemaru may have been subconsciously disguising her identity at first, you can imagine from the hints her face lets slip now and then that she really is enjoying herself.\nThe children are delighted on the occasions they meet her, but at the same time worry whether this Feline seemingly not much bigger than them—so short, with fingers so soft—might have gotten hurt outside.\nOn more than one occasion, HR operators have seen this and sighed to themselves: 'they all think Kazemaru can't be more than a few years older than them.

The council nobles think nothing of the employee forever taking down notes in the corner, and as they wage their war of interests, her pen rarely ever pauses.

She didn't originally have too much of an opinion on it—after all, as a shinobi, the first thing she was trained to do was loyally carry out her lord's orders. However, through completing missions for Rhodes Island, she's gotten to know several Infected friends and noble daughters constantly busy helping the Infected. She's gradually started to shift from her former, rigid, shinobi way of thinking.

She no longer considers herself just an agent of a family, but an agent of impetus, hoping she can do something with Rhodes Island to change the land, and she has long been willing to offer her loyalty to this work.\n'People are scared of the Infected, but they don't know that the corrupt who duck behind the issue, out to achieve nothing but their own goals, are the ones they should fear most.'\nThese are the words she spoke to the operator receiving her, following full handover of her tasks, when she returned aboard one time to report her work.\nShe's all but clear about what it is she needs to do now.",

It is hard to imagine that Executor and Enforcer, both executors from the same Laterano Notarial Hall, have such dramatically different ways of handling people and situations. From this, we can infer that Laterano may have various ways of protecting their citizens' civil rights. Enforcer prefers a more diplomatic approach of listening and mediation, rather than resolving disputes through physical means. He tries to fully understand the intentions and arguments of all parties, before finally resolving the conflict by finding a solution everyone can accept.\nHowever, this does not mean that Enforcer is incapable of fighting—far from it. During his operator exam, Enforcer displayed stunning combat prowess, particularly in close-quarters. Though he may lack experience in emergency situations, as far as his skills are concerned, he is very likely more than capable of dragging everyone to the negotiation table, one way or another.\nGreat, the Notarial Hall even has enforcers like him! The kid even offered to help me whip up a cup of coffee!\n—Closure",

              "storyText": "As we understand it, Enforcer recently completed his training period as an executor of the Notarial Hall, certainly no small feat for someone so young. Under normal circumstances, when a citizen of Laterano receives their patron firearm at the age of twelve, they still need an extensive period of study to truly master using it. After passing a number of examinations and obtaining the corresponding qualification certificates, including the Laterano Firearm Carry and Usage Permit, they formally earn the authorization to use their gun in self-defense, escort duty, ceremonies, and other purposes. Additionally, every few years, gun-owning citizens of Laterano need to bring their patron firearms to the relevant branches of the Notarial Hall and complete gun inspections before they can continue to legally use their 'partners'.\nHowever, the education and training required of a Notarial Hall executor goes far beyond that.\nWorking in the Notarial Hall is a difficult task, and each official requires a deep understanding of several layers of laws, regulations, and rules. In other words, it can be said that many in the Notarial Hall are profound legal scholars. On top of all this, an executor must also have excellent gun-handling skills, and most difficult of all, must deal with situations where they might be forced to point the muzzle at their own kind. This is not something that can be learned from a textbook.\nDue to both the Sankta's laws and their own empathy, it is inherently difficult for one to harbor hostilities towards another, or even to hide their hostilities. Even if it would not violate the law, one still needs to overcome massive psychological pressure, as well as a sense of moral condemnation, to lift one's hand against a fellow Sankta. Perhaps Operator Executor represents the ideal state that skilled, experienced executors should aspire towards. However, Operator Enforcer still managed to pass his Notarial Hall training, all while maintaining his gentle demeanor.\nWith a smile on his face, he told the HR operator that he had no special secrets to accomplish this. Simply a bit more patience.",

Even though she won't be here for long, she has already become good friends with almost all the other children here, and they all look forward to seeing her again. This came as a surprise to us. From what we knew, Cecelia grew up in a very unique environment. Isolated at home for a long time because of her identity, she never had any contact with her peers, and was not given a chance to get along with them or develop bonds. However, Cecelia did not exhibit any social impairments, personality flaws, or psychological problems usually present in children growing up under similar circumstances. Her deceased guardian must've painstakingly nurtured her emotional growth. Undoubtedly, she has been given more than enough love and companionship.\nAccording to Operator Enforcer's explanations, Cecelia's health is not in stable condition, and, following Dr. Kal'tsit's judgment, Rhodes Island will provide her with as much medical assistance as possible. Unfortunately though, there really is not much we can do for this lovely young lady. Dr. Kal'tsit can only provide a few bits of basic medical advice on diet and rest. Given that Cecelia will travel to areas near Kazdel, it will be difficult for Medical to conduct follow-up health monitoring. However, Cecelia assures us that she can take care of herself, and we have little choice but to trust in this precocious girl. After all, Enforcer will be accompanying her along the way. An executor should have the skills to handle whatever challenges may arise on the way.\nIt's worth noting that in the period before leaving for Kazdel, Enforcer often spoke with the operators in charge of educating the minors at Rhodes Island, consulting them in great detail on all the recommended textbooks and supplementary materials from primary education through secondary education, and downloading everything onto his terminal.",

Unexpectedly, Operator Enforcer seems to have a deeper understanding of this than we do, perhaps due to what they experienced during Laterano's Summit of Nations.\nThat's right. The girl named Cecelia has a mix of Sankta and Sarkaz blood. Despite the deep hatred between these two races, there are always those who can overcome the barriers built over thousands of years. To be honest, this girl is not alone. Emotions have a lot more power than one would expect.\nThe truly remarkable thing is that even as a mixed-blood, Cecelia's halo still shines bright above her head, though somewhat unstably. Children between Sankta and foreigners can never be Sankta, and this should have been ironclad law. Their haloes and wings of light are proof of their acceptance by the law, which shuns all else.\nWhat, then, does Cecelia's existence mean?\nWe have too little information to work with.\nNeither Cecelia nor Ezell seemed insistent on asking this question, which is likely the wisest course of action. For us, what truly matters isn't the meaning given to one's existence, but what meaning that existence can go on to create. The journey ahead of them is destined to be rough, and there will be no shortage of trials and tribulations. They may well tread a thorny path, and even come home empty-handed.\nBut their journey will never be in vain, and we wish all the luck in the world to these two youths.",

In his own words, his choice of black coffee is only to help him focus on his work.\nYet when he finishes his work, Enforcer will pull out a separate coffee brewing set. He often spends hours at a time comparing the differences in flavor caused by varying degrees of roasting, configuring the perfect blend of coffee bean varieties, optimizing the proper ratio of cream and sugar, and even subscribing to the Bolívar Agricultural Magazine just to read the coffee planting columns—even though the magazine is often delivered months late. If Enforcer ever invites you to try the new blend of coffee he whipped up after work, be sure to accept his offer: you won't be disappointed.\nHowever, if you ever accept a cup of coffee from him during work hours, be sure to determine whose cup it is.",

Her customary weapon is a specialized shield, with an arming mechanism able to burst up to ten rounds in an extremely short time.\nJust as with Bagpipe's piledriver spear, Horn's shield displays the terrifying might of Victoria's standard ordnance. Londinium is currently in a unique phase, and being in cooperation, we've performed repairs on the weapons borne by Horn and the Victorian soldiers she leads. In the initial stages of work, even the mechanical structure of her shield eluded us.\n'Jeez, no wonder Victoria's got the most advanced mechanical engineering on all of Terra. I can't even picture how I'd develop these weapons any further,' were Closure's words, demonstrating even her awe.\nFortunately, Horn assisted us in disassembling the most difficult parts. Her past military exercises had given her a considerably professional grasp on mechanical technology. With her knowledge, she and the city defense force soldiers fashioned their crossbows and grenades by themselves during a period when supplies were extremely scarce. It's no exaggeration to say that Horn has once again made us find how outstanding the professionalism of Victorian soldiers is.\n'Are you SURE the Royal Guard Academy teaches mechanical engineering? Then what about all the control terminals Bagpipe's wrecked on the ship?!' Addition of this remark has been strongly requested by Closure following perusal of the above paragraph.\nAlso, while this should probably go in the armament evaluation logs, I'll add these battlefield observation records below too, considering we have a shortage of hands on deck for Londinium operations.\nHorn's performance on the battlefield is extremely professional. On top of an all-round, comprehensive combat capacity, she has rich experience in squad command. This completely matches our first impressions, and is a strong fit to Bagpipe's descriptions.\nBut in a few, extremely challenging battles, I and a few other operators witnessed a shift. I might not have been exact under such tense circumstances, so it could be that any change in eye and hair color was my misconception. But it was difficult to ignore her sudden rise in speed, and how vastly different her destructive fighting techniques were to her former restrained and controlled combat style.\nOut of curiosity, I asked the other Victorian soldiers if they knew anything, and heard a few rumors about the White Wolf who was active in the Victorian Army. A white Lupo went mad in Sargon on a moonlit night and tore an entire army to death for an Aslan pasha however many thousand years ago, the White Wolf Count ripped a Vampire prince to shreds with his bare hands however many hundred years ago, and so on... I mean, they just sound like stories that get spread through the streets.\nBut a Medical Department colleague got back to me, and in their view, that kind of combat style would still put a heavy strain on the body, regardless of if she used some unique Originium Arts or activated some hereditary ability in the moment. We're fully aware of how far Horn can go to protect her soldiers and Victoria's civilians, but we hope she won't go that far so lightly.",

Formerly known as the Paragon Army of Victoria, its main duty is to carry out special missions assigned directly by Parliament, with traces of its activity covering all of Victoria, including her enclaves everywhere.\nStructurally, the current Tempest Platoon is still attached to the Victorian Army, and is deployed to the frontline for assault duties in times of war, but is in reality relatively independent. The Platoon is divided into six sections, each section incorporating two operational groups, each operational group typically consisting of five members. The Platoon's members are typically selected for excellence from either other special forces units or the Royal Police, and undergo extremely harsh training. By and large, they possess all-encompassing combat abilities and exceptional intelligence analysis capacity, and are outfitted with the technological cutting edge of Victoria's equipment.\nDue to the Members who first founded the Paragon Army themselves being Royal Guard Academy alumni, the Tempest Platoon has always had inextricable ties with this prestigious military school, from the day of its founding to present times. Every so often, some of the most outstanding graduates will receive recommendation letters from their instructors, which serve as the door to training and evaluation. Nobody on the outside is able to find out anything regarding the ratio of people who pass. Given the standards of the two Tempest Platoon soldiers we've already come into contact with, we imagine that even should one have graduated from the RGA, becoming a formal member of the Tempest Platoon must be considerably challenging.\nAs for Horn herself, anyone who's met her will know that she represents the Tempest Platoon of Victoria's ideal essence. Bravery, loyalty, tenacity, wiping out all that blocks the way as a tempest does. She will fight with her life on the line, for Victoria, for every innocent life of Her people, until the last blood is shed. You know, it's obvious she's of noble birth, isn't it? The child of a prestigious family must've had her pick of options, even if she didn't happen to be the favorite child. She could've served as the trusted aide of a Londinium VIP, or had a cushier time as a commander high up in the Army. Wouldn't anything have been better than joining the Tempest Platoon, doing nothing but the most wearisome and dangerous work?\nThe White Wolf Count... If she's the 'White Wolf,' so to speak, then maybe I can guess. Since the upheaval two decades or so ago, nobility loyal to the Royal Family, especially those in the military, went through harder times. Count Skamandros had been nestling in the border city of Caladon for years by that point. The 'White Wolf's' prowess in the military still remained, and many a Duke feared crossing him, but any of the slightest indication from him could wipe out his whole family then and there. I hear Horn hasn't been back to see her father in years, too. If her choice to join the Tempest Platoon right after graduating is any indication, she likely doesn't approve of her father receding away in self-protection.\nVictoria's future certainly isn't held in the hands of the old nobility entering their elder years, unable to uphold even their past splendor. Whether Victoria becomes the next Gaul will ultimately be seen in the choices made by the young, those like Horn and Bagpipe.\n\n—Personal log of Rhodes Island intelligence personnel stationed in Victoria",

Between him and the dukes' forces, they're keeping each other gagged.\nAs for the power which killed Outcast, Dublinn, you guessed right. They were cozy with a couple of nobles after all.\nSeems now they're trying to get a message to Theresis. Maybe they want to wrangle a partnership.\nGoing by the intel we picked up, odds are rock-bottom that Theresis allies with Dublinn at this stage. He's not going to trust any promises from a mysterious organization who wasn't there yesterday, and he's not going to be arrogant enough to set sights on any city beyond Londinium.\nBut we have to consider worst-case.\nVictoria might just be torn to pieces. The dukes could be provoked into action by Theresis, Dublinn, maybe some other schemer from out of nowhere, and the whole nation would fall into civil strife.\nObviously, Theresis had everything planned, from the moment he got the one Duke's invitation to enter Londinium and put down the rebellion. He had under ten thousand Sarkaz with him when he left Kazdel, but now? Londinium's military factories are producing arms for Theresis day and night. The Nachzehrer's got whatever secret channels he's found, and they're funneling Sarkaz soldiers in from every surrounding nation, straight to Theresis.\nWe still don't know what exactly Theresis is planning, but if this enters all-out warfare, what percent of those soldiers convened there do you figure are leaving Londinium alive?\nAnd after the war's over, even if Victoria can't help itself, it's not like the Sarkaz'll get anything good out of it either. You've seen the way Theresis retaliated against Victoria. Will Kazdel once again become the target of every nation in the centrum? Will we bring a new disaster?\nI don't know, Kal'tsit. You and Blaze always tell me I think too much, but there's only so much I can do. So it's always been.\nAs for Theresis and the Military Commission's plans. I believe Logos and Ascalon are more impatient than I am. All I can do for now is keep going with this Dublinn unit, figure out just what they intend on. If any intel of worth shows up, I'll send it back immediately. I know you've brought up the Draco before, Outcast's rescuee from County Hillock. Once she's ready, she'll give us more info, even help us figure out the truth of Dublinn. In which case, I hope the intel I get will help her make the decision to, ASAP.\nRight. One more thing—I discovered a young Victorian officer in the Dublinn unit's camp. Dead ringer for Bagpipe's 'Leader.' Her commander she described.\nI've been keeping visuals on her for a time, out of caution. You know and I know that there's no looking at how Theresis went uncontested into Londinium without seeing the support from the Londinium army's top echelons. I trust how Bagpipe feels strongly about her leader, but just the same, I firmly believe a cruel war can reshape anyone's sense of wisdom.\nShe wasn't looked after kindly by Dublinn. County Hillock—Mandragora and her subordinates—they insulted her, mocked her, constantly. They didn't put her through excessive physical torture. Maybe they still saw worth in her as a bargaining chip. Actually, no. Let me state this right. For an officer in the prime of her youth, there is no punishment more cruel than having to watch on helplessly while your comrades-in-arms are slaughtered, while you fall into enemy hands with no way to resist.\nI've seen a lot of POWs before. Most lose the will to fight. Life with an interminably long sentence does that to you. Maybe they let hate swallow all their reason.\nI didn't expect her to still be sane. But she was.\nMultiple times, I saw her fall asleep reading out her deceased comrades' names, then bolt awake shouting those same names, but I never saw tears in her eyes. There was still fire in them. The longing to survive and change it all. It was a fire that burned away her sorrow, led her to triumph over despair.\nI even doubt myself, owing to that. Am I too pessimistic? Maybe enough to forget I can lift my head, and behind Londinium's dark clouds, there are still a million morning stars waiting.\nI'm convinced, tomorrow, or this evening, she'll attempt to make her break.\nKal'tsit. It's my belief I should help her. \n\n—Misery",

The catalog appears clearly brand new, used to rest her feet on, while Military History of the Empire has been read to the point its spine is half-cracked.\nThough quite a ways from her current dress style, I can still tell at a glance that this girl with her eyes half-shut is our very Horn.\nJust who was it that sent this letter?\n'To my darling Rita'—a single line written on the reverse, in resplendent but unfamiliar handwriting.\nWho learned of Horn's partnership with Rhodes Island so quickly? Our Messengers were just dispatched, and Bagpipe might not even know her leader's still alive, let alone that we've been active in Londinium.\nWhoever it is, I anticipate them to have known Horn well, and kept a watch on her all this time, as well as Rhodes Island.\nI'll take this letter as means to launch an investigation. I can only hope its sender has no overbearing ill will or more troubling motive.\nBut no matter the case... when I saw this photograph, I couldn't help but think, deep down, about how such a lovable aspect existed to the ever-stern, proper Horn.",

Unlike Feist, who was born into high-tech, Rockrock's background in light industries rendered her ill-equipped to handle mechanical technology, but most of the retrofitting suggestions she put forward were fairly feasible. After Feist implemented these suggestions, the drones demonstrated a remarkable capability in reconnaissance and long-ranged attacks inconsistent with the quality of material used to make them, despite lacking the boon of cutting-edge technology. \nRockrock's weapons demonstrate her staunch determination to protect her family, just like the resolute stance she took during the Londinium crisis. \nShe was outraged by the invasion of the Sarkaz Army and sees all the members of the Self-Salvation Corps as her own family, which is why she was so upset with Feist after he agreed to let Rhodes Island join – her own father was beaten to death by a band of Sarkaz mercenaries for refusing to sell out the city's defense forces, and Rhodes Island happens to have many Sarkaz operators. \nHer father's death was also one of the reasons Rockrock decided to form the Self-Salvation Corps along with her companions. \nRockrock's performance on the battlefield cannot be considered professional, yet also is a far cry from a youth's fearless bravado. She is nothing more than an ordinary civilian forced to step onto the battlefield, and she refused to shy away from it because she did not want to see the Sarkaz hurt any of her family members ever again. Even so, it was too hard for Rockrock to achieve everything she wanted to do herself. Bill was one of the people that Rockrock's father saved back then. Rockrock once resented him for leaving her father behind, but after she came to terms with that critical piece of news herself, she also came to understand the costs and sacrifices that adults spoke of, and made her own decision. Though Rockrock did not give us a detailed account of her mentality following this incident, the captain of another team would be sacrificed right in front of hers eye in a battle just a few days later. Rockrock already knew how to handle that situation – she did not continue to hesitate, instead suppressing her own emotions in an astonishingly short period of time, assuming command of the operations, and successfully seeing it to completion.",

She even has a very puzzling habit - whenever she finds herself saving up any small sum of money, she'll casually give it to her friends. \n'Isn't it natural to give things to friends and relatives who can better put them to use because you have more than what you need at home?' \nJust like how an ordinary family would give things to friends if they had an extra basket of fruit or an extra set of clothes at home, Rockrock sees money in the same light she sees fruits and clothes. She can't even comprehend the difference between 'money' and other objects, or what's so special about it. \nAs a young adult, it's not as if she's never been asked questions such as 'if you don't hold onto any money, what are you going to do when you need it in the future?' In regards to the idea of saving for a rainy day, Rockrock's viewpoint is that she is hesitant to change the way she lives today to account for possible risks in the future, plus... 'Even if you can buy yourself a few extra months with the money you've saved over decades, what's the point of living a few extra months?'\n'Hmm... So in other words, just like if you have too much of something, you can also have 'too much' money. You hate superfluous things, and see them as a hindrance to you, because they get in the way... of you experiencing things like a peaceful life or human warmth. Does that sound about right?'\n––When Heidi received this present from Rockrock for the first time, her interest was piqued, and the two of them had a chat in which she spoke the above words. Rockrock herself didn't have any particular reaction to this statement, replying with an indifferent 'maybe' before going to find the next target to give money to. \n\n'Rockrock gave you money? Hehe, I thought she didn't think much of you, but turns out, she already sees you as a friend!'",

              "storyText": "Sudean's old industrial area was once the pride of Londinium. Steam billowed and gears grinded day and night like an indefatigable giant, continuously exporting all sorts of industrial products throughout Victoria and even countries beyond. However, with the advancement of technology and the shifting structure of industry over the last few decades, the status of old industry has been steadily declining. Victorians used to dub the large-scale assembly lines of traditional industries as the prized cornerstones of society, but in contrast with the development of new technology, their bulkiness and bloat gradually become more obvious, and the steam that once covered the sky became festering scars that the same empire came to see as eyesores. \nAs the times changed, more and more factories became abandoned. The machines that used to run throughout day and night gradually ground to a halt, workshops started to empty out, and abandoned spare parts became battered and rusted after being left unattended for long periods of time. Population gradually began to thin out in the industrial areas, with more and more young laborers searching for a way out while the children and the elderly were left at home, the abandoned factories becoming the children's new playgrounds. \nIt was in this backdrop of old industry's decline that Rockrock grew up. In her eyes, ever since she was very little, everyone around her was like family. Everyone was tight-knit. They would visit each other, give each other gifts, and make small handicrafts together. The factory had a free movie screening room. If her parents didn't come home in time at night, she could knock on a neighbor's door and enjoy a fresh, hot dinner. \nBut everything was slowly changing. One day, she suddenly realized that her playmates and the people she knew were gradually leaving. The adults fought amongst themselves more, and the areas that used to be freely accessible were closed off one by one. Nobody could replenish the things that could once be taken freely. \nInstead, the streets became quieter and quieter, and more and more places were abandoned. New products and new stores occasionally popped up to try to revitalize this aging district, but perhaps because of the dwindling population, perhaps because of the inexplicable sense of decay in the atmosphere, these things all came and went. They would rush in and try to promote their wares and become trendy, but when nobody cared, they would withdraw, leaving only a jumbled mess behind them. \nFrom an outsider's perspective, we can lament the inexorable wheels of history trampling over the warmth of the past, or the advancement of technology leaving outdated people behind, but we have no way of knowing what Rockrock felt. She never tells others about the way she sees the past, so the only glimpse we can get is through her peculiar way of life. \nShe did not care about this kind of 'change.' \nRockrock was the daughter of a train boiler worker, and as such, her father personally taught her the Originium-powered train boiler technology he was so proud of, but this technology is rarely used today. Just like all the other workers' children, Rockrock also liked running to the factories when she was a child. One day, she and her playmate found various spare parts from an abandoned factory and crafted her first product that could hardly be considered a craft. This event flung open the door to her own craftsmanship. \nBased on Rockrock's own account, her previous residence was full of things she built herself. From small combs and scissors to large wardrobes and bedframes, everything was made with her own hands. Even if the cabinet's wooden board might've been split unevenly, or the iron sheet from the scissors is poking out from the handle, all of that was of little concern to her. It's not that she didn't have the ability to make these things more refined - but they were already 'good enough.' \nThough these things may have been shoddy and sometimes difficult to use, the sense of intimacy that they brought to Rockrock was irreplaceable. \nOf course, not everyone around her understands her way of life. It's not as if she doesn't understand the benefits of industrial goods. She simply enjoys these things, and is willing to spend a lot of her time and energy in order to fill her surroundings with her own creations. Rockrock understands that this is just a personal quirk of hers - she never gives what she makes to others, simply continuing her own way of life, silently, steadfastly, and without fanfare. \nJust as with the era she had grown up in, time will slowly take away the prosperity of the old industrial area. In the end, the only thing people can hold onto is what they are most familiar with. \n\nOh, by the way, if you absolutely need her to fulfill an order for you, make sure to explain the reason clearly. Otherwise, she can easily reach the misunderstanding that you're trying to poke fun at her, thinking that the stuff she makes is too shoddy. She WILL get mad at you. ––Logistics Department Operator \nOne more thing, she really won't put more precision in her work just because somebody else ordered it. ––Subsequent addendum from the same operator",

              "storyText": "'As stubborn as a rock' –– this is the unanimous opinion that people around Rockrock have of her. \nEven in this modern city, she has adhered to her traditional way of living for many years. Naturally, many people tried to persuade her that 'this is not good' or 'that is not right,' but Rockrock has never been persuaded. For example, even if you try telling her a thousand times that an air conditioner is a good thing since it's not good for the body to be too hot or too cold while inside a room, Rockrock, like a curmudgeonly old man, will still stick to her own ideas and view you as a nuisance, even if you install an air conditioning unit for her. \nBut, every rule has its exceptions. \n'Viewpoints and experiences shape the human shell, while thoughts and feelings form the human soul.' \nWhile returning to the landship to report in one time, Rockrock picked up this sentence from a book that the Doctor was reading. The other operators present at the time thought nothing of the Doctor's choice of literature, but Rockrock took the initiative to ask: 'What are you reading?' \nAfter that, she carefully listened to passage after passage of the Doctor's soliloquy that most ordinary people would find esoteric and inscrutable. \nNot long after Rockrock returned to Londinium, the Doctor received a letter from the Londinium branch. The contents of the letter basically expressed gratitude for the Doctor's teachings, saying that Rockrock had grown a lot since going back. \nThough neither the Doctor nor the operator who wrote the thank-you letter knew what exactly the Doctor did, these changes were plenty evident the next time they interacted with her. In the past, if she encountered people or things she could not understand, such as Rhodes Island being able to regard Sarkaz as their teammates, members of the Self-Salvation Corps not being able to fully trust their teammates, or teammates who still harbored selfish thoughts on the battlefield, she absolutely would never try to understand their motivations. But since the last debriefing, Rockrock began trying to actively reach out to those people. Even if the process was bumpy at first, she at least no longer shut down those lines of communication altogether and began to seriously consider the situations of people who are different from her. \nThe girl has changed the way of doing things that she uncompromisingly retained for so long. \nFrom this we've learned that profound ideas and philosophy may be the right tools to influence Rockrock. Though isn't particularly well-educated and normally describes herself as 'not very literate,' she seems to have an innately acute understanding of more obscure ideas. \nGive her the wisdom of philosophers. Let her think, debate, and absorb. Then, it will be possible to move her. \nHaving that said, the change in Rockrock's attitude towards the Sarkaz race did not come from books or philosophy, but rather from fighting alongside everyone in Rhodes Island, especially Closure. During the process, she came to realize that not every Sarkaz, or every noble, was responsible for the collapse of her homeland, but rather, only the Sarkaz and nobles with dark intentions. Therefore, the people standing at her side, regardless of their status or identity, are her new teammates and family. \nEveryone has something they cling to, and we have no intention of forcing her to let go of those things. However, seeing this girl with resolute ideals decide to walk down the same path as us has undoubtedly been a monumental source of spiritual encouragement and support.",

She tried to jump out again and again, and Bill had to restrain her each time. I was there watching them fight. Stubborn. That little runt was so damn stubborn.

He claims to be a fully grown adult, but like all Durins, there's no way to tell for sure just by looking.\nFrom what Chestnut told us, the Druins often use all kinds of crystal lights for lighting, and he has long had an interest in these colorful crystals, even hoping that he could one day mine these beautiful rocks himself. Dreams are always the best motivator, and even though most Durins are lively in nature and dislike confinement, to make his small childhood wish come true, Chestnut learned every last detail he could from the adults in his tribe about these ores. When he dug his first crystal out of the ground and unleashed its colorful radiance, he excitedly made a small lamp out of this ore. Even though this small crystal lamp isn't particularly well-made and its light's color isn't especially vivid, it is still one of Chestnut's favorite possessions.\nWhen they spend their entire lives living underground, it is very important to the Durins to continue to build and expand their underground cities. They must first survey the geological features of their destination to determine whether it is suitable for habitation. The adults who taught Chestnut his geological knowledge became his teacher, and in this underground world where there isn't a clear concept of occupation, they formed a close relationship built upon knowledge and enthusiasm. Whenever the city had to be expanded, Chestnut and his teachers would put all their knowledge and power to use to repay their homeland.\nAfter Chestnut made it to the surface, he changed course and instead walked the path of a doctor. Although his teachers and friends couldn't understand his fixation on the surface, they took notice of how he persisted down this path quietly and decided to support the boy who's so fond of researching his interests. After all, there are many ways that one can live. As long as you are happy and you aren't affecting anyone else, who could say that's the wrong way to live?\n\nHe gave me a small ore as a present and said it's unique to the Durins. That's so cute!\n—Note from the writer",

The Durins need to regularly trade with tribes that live elsewhere, and so they generally have friendly relationships with each other, and large scale bloodshed is extremely rare. Which is why he thought of war as something very far removed from him.\nOne day, a Catastrophe occurred on the surface directly above Chestnut's homeland by coincidence and triggered a larger scale cave-in, which destroyed a substantial portion of the underground city. Although the situation on the surface was unclear, the underground structure had already been altered. Chestnut understood that his homeland needed his help. He traversed the fissures opened by the Catastrophe, collected samples and ores, and recorded data that could affect his homeland. By the time he was finished with his work, half a year had passed. His tribe repaired much of the rail tracks and elevators thanks to the data that he and the other prospectors collected, and the only things left could only be healed with the passing time and continued effort. Having seen everything turn out so successfully, Chestnut finally had the time to explore the question he had at the very beginning: 'Just what happened on the surface?'\nWhen he was still a kid, Chestnut was already struck with admiration of the surface, having heard how vast and wide it was on the surface from adults that had been there. He was perhaps even more of a fan of the surface than the unique landscapes underground. Chestnut worked on his plan to climb aboveground day after day, and even though reality wasn't quite how he imagined, he didn't let it get to him. Ignoring the fissures that led aboveground and the glimpses of the blue sky above during his geological surveys, Chestnut instead turned his attention to the ground under his feet.\nWith the way things are now, Chestnut decided to take the chance to do some traveling. He rode the newly repaired elevators traversed layers after layers of dark but differing geological cross sections, and finally made it above ground for the first time. He kept going, and aside from that narrow blue above he ignored during his surveys, he saw a lot of landscapes that even the tribesmen who returned from surface never saw: a large, bottomless valley; a wide, calm lake; and strange, wind-eroded rocks. Yet he also saw something that's the furthest away from beauty for the first time: the land-dwellers' blood-soaked wars. After everything came to an end, Chestnut asked them about the cause. Apparently, a group of bandits attempted to steal the farmers' harvest, leading them to fight back. Born and raised in the underground where items are traded peacefully, he didn't understand why this happened, but he felt there was something for him to do, and so he raised his staff and offered this group of men a helping hand.\nAlthough his hometown is habitable after it was repaired by his tribesmen, Chestnut has already made the decision to remain on the surface. He chose to follow his childhood dream. What's more, there are a lot more people here who need his help.",

He started to take field operations one after another, upholding his responsibility at each and every meaningful and meaningless conflict along the way. Most of our operators are very fond of this calm doctor, and Chestnut himself also treasures everyone's trust greatly, leading him to devote himself in his work to save his patients more rapidly and attentively.\nThat said, the operators and Chestnut himself both overlooked one thing during his onerous missions, and that's how humans must, aside from work, also pay attention to how they feel in their hearts. Chestnut encountered a problem that almost every doctor encounters at some point during their practice: It seems that simply being a doctor doesn't affect much.\nOne day, after the field operations squad had completed all the preparations for their evacuation, they found Chestnut standing on a patch of muddy field when they called roll. He didn't respond to their calls, even casting his Originium Arts into the sky in a retaliatory way.\nAfter he got back to the landship, Chestnut told our Medical Department's operators his misgivings: With pain caused by sickness, he believes that as long as he keeps putting in the effort, even the most stubborn of diseases can be defeated. But after he came to the surface, he realized just how many of the injured were wounded by conflict. Their pains weren't caused by disease, but something much more complicated that he is unsure of. He can treat them, but he cannot stop those more complicated reasons from happening. In particular, through his work in Rhodes Island, he has had much more chances to see for himself how ugly war is.\nChestnut started to crumple.\nHe looked at this strange, beautiful world and began to reminisce his homeland.\nAnd so, Rhodes Island approved his leave request.",

Everything was the same, only that, this time, he was the adult that came back from the surface, yet he didn't feel he deserved the children's admiration with the way he was.\nDuring his vacation, Chestnut started to work his old job of geological prospecting and crystal ore mining again. On his free time, he visited the waterfall he used to visit as a kid and compare his height to the fluorescent mushrooms there. This slow-paced life gave him more time to think: What is it that I wanted to do in the very beginning? What am I so distressed about? Is the thing that's giving me all this anxiety something I can solve if I put myself to it?\nJust like when he worked as a geological prospector to help his tribesmen, although a Catastrophe striking his homeland was vexing, he knew there was nothing he could do to stop Catastrophes. In that case, saving others as a doctor should be no different. He knew there was nothing he could do to stop the conflicts between people, and he must accept that.\nChestnut spent over a month to carefully think about all this. He didn't know if this was just a fake sense of optimism for self consolation, but he felt he couldn't let what he had no control over to drag him down any longer. He chose to return to work, as only then will he be able to find the right way to solve these problems.\nWhen Chestnut returned to Rhodes Island, it was obvious that he now had a much firmer conviction. Although psychological scars cannot be completely erased within such a short amount of time, everyone at Rhodes Island is happy to see him moving forward once again.",

Pay just a little attention when you're in Victoria, and you can find the name Heidi Thomson crop up from time to time in newspapers' literature and arts columns, or maybe on a romance novel bookshelf. However, should you ask the bookshop's owner about it, you'll find her few novels have hardly sold well; they've sat there piling up forever. By her very same sincerity, perhaps, Heidi did not do with Rhodes Island as she does when visiting noble residences, bringing her works with her as a meeting gift.\nThough she never made it big as an author, it was in fact her maiden work that got her foot in high society's door, and from there mingled with the aristocrats wherever they gathered. This can be principally attributed to her family name already having enough renown in the Victorian literary sphere. Plenty of the gentry are old friends with her father, and so they show every courtesy to the young author continuing her father's work, often bidding her to appreciate works and publish commentaries, so as to keep up her appearances. The vast majority commend Heidi's talent in succeeding her father on the literary front, believing her book sales are simply laid low by misfortune; a small portion are frank to point out that 'she's unable to escape her father's aura.'\nHowever, Golding, whom Heidi frequently exchanges letters with, scoffs at these evaluations.\n'How do others see Heidi? That's hardly important, nor does she mind. She herself chose the position of third-rate novelist. She deliberately covers life up with fictitious writing. What you see is hardly the end of her talents. I know where it is she's set on pouring her true works and ideas. It's a shame how one's private letters are forever bound to be made public posthumously, no earlier.'\n'Why is this the way she does things?

Through several months of arrangement and bribery by Heidi, the Rhodes Island landship gained the ostensible status of 'organization for scrap reclamation,' and swiftly passed all border checkpoint inspections, staying incognito under Theresis' surveillance, all to enter Victoria and approach Londinium.\nFor many years, the network of contacts Heidi and her father have built in Victoria has relayed info precisely as such. The Messenger accepts intel to be entered into information storage equipment, delivers it to the resident Dr. Kal'tsit at Rhodes Island, and then launches into action based on the reply.\n—Those Operators who've heard of this Messenger's activities prefer to imagine Heidi as cunning and sharp, easily all things to all people, but the reality is that, onboarded at Rhodes Island, Heidi seems unexpectedly relaxed.

I think it'll be far better to make her your student, rather than let her keep using you as a character template in all her childish stories.\nShe's at the proud, arrogant age now, and won't take a single word of advice from me. You'll see once you receive her own letters. I say that of it all she knows precisely the half of it; she postulates and conjectures far too much about the facets of the great land you unveil in your letters, not to mention the extravagance of her ambitions.\nWe aspire wildly so in our younger years.

She showed a great deal of sharp wit when we took up the Duke on his invitation; she adopted an ignorance appropriate to her age as a cover, to inquire about a great deal quite ingeniously.\nMoreover, she's shown quite the timely talent for endearing others. Not that I can say it's been deliberate of her—only that she's had quite the words for me about my methods ever since I changed professions, so every time a stranger greets me on old literary circle business, she's there lukewarm, and insists on giving her own opinion or two.\nYou know my views. I'd rather she not write a word, speak not a thing about this, and I don't like her using 'literature' as her stepping stone into the noble circles.\nMost of it is to spite me; she's at the stage where she willingly has me read all the gibberish she pens. She hasn't yet truly set foot into these lands, hence how feathery and hollow most of her writing is. I say gibberish with no exaggeration.\nBut there is a redeeming quality.

It is not my wish that these phrases constitute homesickness for her some day in the future, let alone for the Victorians one and all.\nPerhaps more practical terms will do. How long until we no longer have the written word to read?

After chatting with her, many operators got their first glimpse into this mysterious deep-sea country. \nIn Specter's own words, in the ocean far from land's shores lies a utopian country: there is no Originium, the people do not have to worry about survival, and citizens are assigned to work where they are best suited according to their personal abilities. Light covers the bottom of the sea, and each transparent dome carves out a small piece of paradise. Everyday life is filled with various automatic equipment, and almost all mechanized manual labor is completed by high-end technological products. As a whole, the society is even more ideal than the images conceived in Terra's most cutting-edge science fiction novels. \nSpecter's descriptions undoubtedly satisfied most operators' conception of an exotic, far-flung country, and they naturally ignored the things she mentioned far less often: the immense pressure that the Seaborn posed to the survival of the Ægir people, and the destruction wrought upon Ægir by the Seaborn's followers. \nThe Abyssal Hunters invariably face the same problems on land that they did beneath the waves. \nBut due to their lack of manpower, the Abyssal Hunters are unable to change anything. In the face of the scourge of the seas that cannot be completely driven out even with the Ægir's science and technology, what can the land-dwellers' puny technology accomplish? \nThis is the Abyssal Hunters' status quo. Gladiia has long been concerned about this, and Specter is well aware of it. \nHaving that said, she has no reservations about cooperating with her friends on land. This is not due to some calculus based on ability or practicality, but rather because on an emotional level, she feels that fighting with these soft, vulnerable companions might make miracles. \nThat is the reason she leads the charge into enemy lines, her chainsaw's battle-dance opening up the slimmest of chances for her friends. \nAfter all, she already created a chance for Skadi's team to kill a so-called 'Him.' \nWhy can't she do it again?",

Thanks to the nature of her parents' work, she had access to Ægir's bountiful art collection since a young age. Among the various art mediums, sculpture left an indelible imprint within Specter.

Because of this, citizens generally do not refuse when summoned by state institutions such as the Abyssal Hunters. Specter completed her metamorphosis with ease, quickly mastered what she was trained for, and officially became an Abyssal Hunter, hunting Seaborn along with Gladiia. Thus, her obsession with beauty turned into a deep hatred of the Seaborn. It may be the case that Seaborn evolve into striking forms that leave people awestruck, but this cannot be considered beauty - rather, it is more of a byproduct of evolutionary needs. The Ægirians' most ingenious creations are useless pieces of artifice in these creatures' eyes, a perspective that Specter could not tolerate. The 2nd Abyssal Hunter team to which she belonged was once responsible for clearing out a large Seaborn lair: an entire city that had fallen into the sea, its various buildings turned into breeding nests. When she saw the colors bleeding from torn oil paintings and the desecrated stone statues covered with nests, she no longer had any reservations in her heart about slaying the Seaborn. \nNow that civilization has encountered vermin, Specter is more than happy to play the role of exterminator. \nThrough their deaths, Ægir's survival is forged.",

Or perhaps it would be more accurate to say that she very quickly accepted her change in identity.\nAll of Irene's files were personally handled by Kal'tsit herself, and she was quickly registered as a Rhodes Island Operator without going through much of the cumbersome steps the process normally entailed. Afterwards, Irene was assigned to the Iberian Special Task Force and, for the time being, she will not participate in regular missions. Outside of work, however, Irene continues to live alongside other Operators and proactively studies tactical techniques she has yet to master. She is stricter than anyone else in upholding Rhodes Island's rules, and she spends all her down time at the library. Occasionally, she muses that it reminds her of her time at the Inquisition as a student. Much deservedly, her efforts bore fruit. Her internalized knowledge aside, the improvement in her combat skills and overall physical tests' results were more than enough for her instructors and other reserve Operators to see her in a different light.\nEverything that Irene is doing is her following through with her belief: 'It's not my identity that determines who I am. It's what I do that does.'\nLikewise, after a lengthy period of time, many of Rhodes Island's Operators finally realized that although she may seem overly serious and taciturn, Irene isn't one to refuse the friendship of others.

This relationship began to wane with Iberia's rise during its Golden Age. After the Profound Silence, a dozen men, including Carmen, reformed and expanded the church until it reached its enormous size today. The Inquisition's main responsibility remains responding to the threat from the sea, but, at the same time, the Inquisition is also an organization that can truly determine Iberia's politics. This is information that we already know of, and Irene has nothing more to add to that end.\nThe lantern and handcannon that Operator Irene carries around with her are both standard Iberian Inquisition equipment. They are modeled after the ones carried by the statues of saints that date to the Iberian Church era. The lantern is in reality a special kind of staff through which any Originium Arts cast can affect a person's nervous system, which can be used to deter normal foes as well as protect allies and the user herself from the Sea Terror and Seaborn's attacks. Similarly, firing a handcannon is also fundamentally a kind of Originium Arts. When Irene fires her handcannon, the strength her weapon unleashes exceeds even that of normal handguns. However, according to Irene's own testimony and the relevant mission logs, that hardly even scratches the surface of what this weapon is capable of. The only thing holding it back is Irene not being able to wield it freely at the moment.\nWhen our Engineering operators asked to study these special weapons, Irene immediately agreed.\n'Nowhere does our lawbooks say that we can't hand over our weapons. If that will help us better fend off the threats of the sea, feel free to study them however you want.'\nHowever, the Engineering Department's efforts to research the weapons were quickly abandoned.\n'We can't analyze the weapon any further without taking it apart and irreparably damaging it in the process. That goes to show how this difficult this technology is to attain,' concluded Weedy of the Engineering Department with a displeased tone.\nWe have noticed that certain Ægir operators from Iberia display varying levels of discomfort or stress whenever they see Irene and her lantern. Although they have no reason to be afraid of Irene, one can imagine that there must be a reason behind the way they react. Her Inquisition standard-issue equipment is, in a sense, a symbol of the Inquisition itself. From what a few Ægir operators have told us that, overtime, Ægir carrying swords and lanterns have become a common sight in Iberia.\n'The Ægir brought evil and calamity.' Many Iberians have that impression, and Irene once shared that view as well, but after the string of events that unfolded before her eyes, Irene began to see them in a different light. Although, the treatment Iberian Ægir receives remains a difficult issue just like that of the Infected, at the very least, Irene is making amends for this strange relationship by being friendly to all of Rhodes Island's Ægir operators.\n'Until today, the Inquisition has been a vital part of Iberia's defensive power. There is no greater burden than the responsibility that Inquisitors shoulder when they lay down judgment as just the slightest mistake can lead to terrible outcomes that no one can take responsibility for. Which is why, most of the time, the Inquisitors' top priority is to prevent the worst outcome from happening... but that's no excuse for the Inquisition's sometimes trivially-made decisions. The judgments of Inquisitors must answer to everyone on Iberian soil.'\n—Brief excerpt from Irene's mission report for the 'Stultifera Navis' incident.",

Do you think it could understand our language?'\n'It could... or at least that's what it felt like. I couldn't see its face, much less its eyes, but it seemed like it knew my maestro, and it seemed to know that we had never met. When I took a step forward, it responded. Not by making any sounds, but rather by twitching its whole body. It was like a different kind of language.'\n......\n'Just by being in the same room made me feel like my brain was about to collapse. Everything I could understand was being sucked away from my body. But my maestro encouraged me to talk to it and ask it questions nonetheless... In the end, all I could ask was, 'Who are you.''\n'It definitely heard my words. After some twitching, it faced me and stretched its body as wide as it could, almost like it was introducing itself...'\n'I saw it twitch—It didn't struggle; it just twisted and wriggled around. Just by looking at it, what it was trying to express just seemed to flow into my mind directly.'\n'It told me that it wanted to leave.'\n......\n'My maestro told me that this is a path that all students must walk to become a High Inquisitor—facing the truth.'\n'This is what the Inquisition had been hiding the whole time—that the greatest threat Iberia faces that people know of, the threat that is written in our scriptures, the most vile, wretched things... might perhaps be a different kind of civilization.'\n\n'Finally, I want to ask you one more thing. How did you treat it after you witnessed all of this?'\n'I saw it as an enemy.'\n—From the encrypted audio recording of the conversation between Irene and Kal'tsit at the HR Department",

              "storyText": "The natural disaster that engulfed Irene's hometown when she was a child was quite a cruel joke that came to have a sacrificial meaning in the religious sense to her. She lost all her family members and her peaceful life in the disaster. All she had left in her life after that were the scriptures that shielded her from the collapsing roof and Dario, who rescued her from the ruins. It's not hard to imagine just how important the scriptures' faith and Dario have become to her after such unfortunate events.\nYet Irene has never mentioned just how regrettable the sudden goodbye she had to bid her master was to her. The noble warrior was more important to her than anything. Perhaps, he was even more than a teacher or a father figure to her, although he was more often a distant shadow that stood in front of her than a teacher that was there for her at her side. Irene often says that she had a long way to go to reach her maestro's level, but we have reason to believe that aboard that golden ship that day and under that great lighthouse, the blaze she gave rise to was no less radiant.\nNow, aboard Rhodes Island, Irene is no longer a member of the Inquisition who merely defends her nation. Instead, she is now a warrior who represents the will of Iberia and works with the Ægir and Rhodes Island to fend off the threat that all of Terra faces. The burden that Irene shoulders in silence is unfathomable to most. When most people look at her, they only see a slender girl studying tirelessly in the library and training room, and occasionally her figure on the deck as she gazes southward.\nFrom Sal Viento to Gran Faro and then to Rhodes Island, Irene very quickly accepted the change in her identity and her growth. The familiar figure that once stood in front of her is now gone, and Irene now gets to see the full scenery of the path ahead. Even if what awaits her up ahead is an endless, turbulent night, Irene will continue to walk forward without fail. Perhaps she will one day realize that it wasn't the scripture that led her down this path. It might not even have been Dario. No matter what kind of twists and turns they must take on their path, those who possess true virtue and a love for others will always find themselves on a righteous path.",

They tried to build a fort here and once again challenge the unknown dangers of the depths brought about after the Profound Silence. Lumen's biological parents as well as Mayor Thiago, who would later look after Lumen, were all part of this project. According to Lumen's onboarding documents, his parents participated in this project as lighthouse engineers tasked with rebuilding the connection with the 'Eye of Iberia,' a lighthouse stranded in the ocean, in order to pave a way back to the ocean for the people who were unwilling to relent to calamity. They continued to believe that their work would bear fruit, even giving their lives to the cause. In an operation that was later deemed to be too reckless and ambitious, the two engineers and an entire operation team disappeared into the thick fog. \nHowever, after countless investments of time, faith, and blood, this plan was eventually abandoned. On one fateful night, the Inquisition cleaned out almost the entire town, taking away most of the Ægir Islanders. In a report that followed, the Inquisition claimed that some of the Ægir workers in the town had been corrupted by the Church of the Deep, that their foul conspiracy had been sundered, and that that just punishment had been meted out. \nLumen said that he was too young to be able to provide us with more information about this part of Gran Faro's history. But according to our information, Mayor Thiago's wife, an Ægir named 'Marin,' was taken from the town during the turmoil and never returned. \nIt may well be the case that nobody will ever know the full truth of that incident, now sealed away in some file cabinet in the Inquisition; it may also be the harsh reality that the truth no longer matters. Be it any of the witnesses of this event, or Lumen himself, only one choice remains: continue to live on, and try to prove that there is still a purpose to living.",

He thoroughly enjoys watching operation records and shows great reverence and enthusiasm towards the Doctor, as well as the operators featured in those records. Those experiences that we take for granted are legendary tales for Lumen, who stayed exclusively in his hometown since he was born. \nLumen always describes himself as an ordinary person, and seems to harbor a hidden fear in his heart about becoming an operator of Rhodes Island. Despite that, just about every operator is more than willing to work alongside Lumen. Indeed, Lumen's body and spirit are no different from ordinary people. He cannot release powerful Originium Arts, and is not an expert in any academic field. Beyond that, however, he still possesses certain qualities that are less obvious, but no less important to us: for example, extending kindness to all irrespective of identity, a determination to always keep moving forward, and courage in times of desperation. \nRhodes Island is not, and should never be, a place reserved for the 'elite.' While some of our operators do have incredible abilities, and others hold prestigious positions, our cause is not just driven by these people. Every single person who aspires to make this world a better place, every little bit of power they can contribute, enables us to stand up to this hardship-choked land. \nSo, when you find Lumen toiling away in the training grounds, or hard at work delving into the complexities of Originium Arts to no avail, it won't hurt to bring him a bottle of water and pat him on the back.\nAfter all, every little bit of progress he makes is apparent to all of us.",

Could you answer my question first, then? Is Pallas here or not?'\nWhen Erato arrived at Rhodes Island after her long, weary travels, her first question was, 'Is Pallas here or not?' Common sense tells us that those who harbor ill will against Pallas wouldn't come knocking on our door directly, but considering the sensitive issue regarding Pallas's status, we immediately verified Erato's identity.\nErato was born in a village in southern Minos. She is skilled in archery and harpistry, and she participated in Minos's war against Sargon's invasion, going on to achieve many great feats on the battlefield. All of the above information was verified to be true after a thorough investigation by the HR Department.\nJust like Pallas, Erato participated in the war against Sargon, but the two of them fought on different battlefields. After the invaders were chased out of her homeland, Erato, who has grown weary of living a peaceful life, heard rumors of the 'Goddess of Victory' and wanted to meet this heroine in person. After she asked around, she learned that Pallas is undergoing Oripathy treatment at a certain medical company in secret, and after an arduous journey, she finally found Rhodes Island.\nHaving confirmed with Pallas and found that she, too, has a strong urge to meet this warrior from her homeland, HR arranged for the two to meet. As the two came from the same area and share similar interests and senses of aesthetics, they naturally hit it up with one another very quickly, but they also went their separate ways just as quickly after a long night of conversation.\n'If Pallas wishes to go into hiding here, then let her, but even if all of Minos and the Twelve Heroes accept that image of a perfect 'Goddess of Victory' she tries to maintain, I will never accept it myself!' Pallas, on the other hand, simply lamented regretfully: 'If only Erato had a little more tolerance for alcohol.'\nIn the end, Erato found herself fascinated by the epic adventures and tales of Rhodes Island as recounted by Pallas and decided to stay, eventually becoming a Field Operator after passing the onboarding exams.",

This is particularly visible in the villages near Minos's borders, which still see Sargonian aggression from time to time. The Minoan people banded together and formed a guerilla force to fend against the Sargonian army. Erato was a member of this guerilla force, and her performance as an Operator during missions shows us that her archery skills were truly battle-tested on the frontlines.\nErato's techniques as a harp player are no less impressive than her archery. Setting aside the issue of her past performance history, her regular harp and minstrelry performances at the Convalescent Garden quickly became a popular entertainment mainstay at Rhodes Island. Erato is also able to disturb her enemies' neural systems with her unique Originium Arts by playing her harp. Some Leithanian Operators believe that this type of Originium Arts is fundamentally the same as the musical Originium Arts frequently seen in Leithanien. Although Erato keeps her Originium Arts education background a closely guarded secret, one thing that is certain is that her mastery of this form of Originium Arts still has much room for improvement. This is especially visible in her ability to put her enemies to sleep with her harp as it just as frequently puts her audience to sleep too. It seems Erato herself doesn't seem to mind that at all, however.\n'They are about to have a nice dream. Let the story continue there.'\n\n[Addendum]\nThe Hymnic Games, alternately known as the Warriors' Gathering, is a time-honored sporting event held in the Hall of the Twelve Heroes in Athenius. The Games promote the strengthening of the body and maintaining a proactive mindset. Indeed, the Games are very popular among the populace and attracted talented entrants from all over Minos to participate in its competitions in Athenius, and the Games have also had many new competitions added over the years.\nAside from Athenius, many other cities have also held competitions of a similar format that are also named the 'Hymnic Games.' The Games that Erato participated in were actually jointly held by a few smaller towns in the southern part of Minos. Given their scale, the competitions are definitely nothing to be scoffed at, but they simply do not compare to the Hymnic Games of Athenius. That being said, Erato's gold medals are indeed all officially certified.\nGiven her skills, perhaps we can look forward to her scoring big at the next Athenius Games.",

Rather, searching for Pallas was never the sole objective of her journey. From Minos, she traveled to Bolívar, Columbia, Kazimierz, Leithanien, and at last found Rhodes Island at Victoria. Although Erato saw this as a fun little trip, all of us know that such a long journey required extraordinary willpower and determination.\nDuring her journeys, Erato kept a notebook in which she detailed her travel experiences. She did so in all manners, from long epics about her travels to mere scribbles describing the nameless sights she saw. Sometimes, she even wrote a few poems spontaneously. She didn't take much care to organize these records, but the culture and customs of each region she visited were more than adequately captured in her chronicles.\nAside from the sights she saw on the way, the notebook also included many mythologies and heroic legends that Erato collected during her journeys. Although she is unaware of it herself, these mythologies from these many different regions reflect the locals' values and historical views to a certain extent. 'Survival is the force behind all human intelligence. With time, they become experience, and through legends and mythologies, they become the truth.' With the large array and variety of stories Erato collected throughout her journeys, one could say her notebook itself is worthy of folkloristic study.\nErato is certainly enthusiastic when it comes to collecting the legends and stories of different regions, but she is a bona fide expert when it comes to Minoan folklore. Throughout the centuries of Sargonian invasion, Minos lost much of its cultural literature, and all the stories passed down through the word of mouth became the only records of many historical events. Despite how their conversation ended on an unpleasant note, Pallas frequently talks to Erato to record the Minoan legends she has heard of.\n'Why are you sorting out these stories now? Are you going to take them back to the Hall of the Twelve Heroes with you?'\n'If you don't mind, I would actually rather you bring them there yourself...'\n'I knew it! You boring, perfectionist priestess! Very well. I'll write down all your drunken mishaps at Rhodes Island and bring them there!'\n\n[Classified Log]\nAfter Erato, a lover of botany and flora, discovered the Rhodes Island Convalescent Garden, she quickly became one of its most frequent visitors. However, it seems there is more than just flowers on Erato's mind. We have received reports that, on several occasions, Erato stared at Perfumer as she worked, awestruck. She seemed like she wanted to strike up a conversation, yet she always held herself back. As requested by Pallas, this record will be kept hidden for the time being.",

I think of myself more as a character of a story. I hope that many, many years later, there will be people telling my story, and it'll be a story that will fill its listeners with love and hope when they reach its end.'\nMany Minoans seek the glory of heroes, and Erato is no exception. However, Erato also has her own understanding about heroes and glory beyond that.\nHeroes should stand with the people and be spiritual leaders to them. They need to be able to inspire later generations to pick up arms against their oppressors like the legends of the Twelve Heroes. They must also be able to guide the masses with their songs of beauty and poems and benevolence, and embrace the lands with a gentle heart. In Erato's songs, the main characters are in general not particularly strong, and sometimes they even have very obvious flaws, but all of them are optimistic and kind-hearted without fail. The main characters go through many trials and tribulations, and in the end always reach a satisfactory ending. Perhaps this is the concept that Erato has of heroes: through some gentle way, they inspire the masses to live with passion. The pursuit of love and beauty can become a belief for people to live by. Perhaps that is the source of Erato's interest in everything and her seemingly endless enthusiasm.\nThose who don't have a firm understanding of ugliness do not deserve to discuss beauty, and those who have never experienced hardship should never speak of hope. Having visited so many places and seen so many sights, the beauty that Erato sings of in her songs and poems indeed has that kind of inspirational power.",

Neither of his parents are Infected, but as they were unable to keep up with the rapid progress of technology, they could only keep working the most basic kind of work at the old factories' assembly lines. Windflit's parents had pinned their faith on him: they hoped he would break away from this cycle and not become a workman. Following their wishes, Windflit and his parents scraped together the tuition to get him enrolled in the city's affluent district's high school, though he transferred to another high school about half a year later and finished his studies there. Windflit is a fast learner, and he quickly got the hang of any mechanical assembly line when he helped his parents out at the factories, to the point that he pointed out areas of improvement. He also received excellent grades while he was in school and entered a famous Columbian academic institution to continue his mechanical studies.\nAfter he graduated, he was hired by Rhodes Island after sending us his resume. However, when he first came onboard, he showed some minor introverted tendencies as well as obvious animosity on an emotional level against operators from affluent backgrounds. The Doctor and HR operators should keep an eye out to prevent any internal strifes.\nCurrently, Windflit is assigned to the Engineering Department, where his main responsibilities include designing and producing Originium mechanical devices as well as providing our operators support during combat via mechanical devices.",

Even an impoverished family like Windflit's wouldn't live among the Infected if they had the option not to. Windflit, who has always been focused on his own life, rarely ever turned his attention to this group of people that seemed worlds apart.\nIt wasn't until he moved to the dormitories that he first truly understood what the equality promoted by the onboarding training truly meant. Having been treated harshly because of his family's situation, he knows better than anyone how it feels to be ostracized and discriminated against, which is why he is unwilling to make anyone else feel this way, even if he isn't yet entirely comfortable around them. And so, when Ethan welcomed his new roommate like an old buddy, Windflit simply accepted his goodwill. After the two got to know one another overtime, they started to have a decent understanding of each other's past.\n'As a non-Infected, is my existence itself unfair to the Infected?'\nOne time, Windflit asked Ethan during one of their everyday conversations.

Whether the biography is on a political, literary, military, or civilian figure; whether the experiences written therein are from told by the subject himself or recounted by others; and whether the philosophies that can be derived from it are deep or shallow, Windflit will always quietly judge the decisions these historical figures made at the pivotal points of their lives. He once read the story of a scholar who persevered through seven failures before finally achieved success, and we found afterwards that the corners of those few pages of the book were particularly worn out by his fingers' frequent back-and-forth flipping.\nWhen he first came to Rhodes Island, Windflit mentioned he did not have any concrete plans for himself. The reason he decided to work is very simple: his parents are getting older in age. He said that ever since he became an adult, he had always felt a kind of pressure for spending all his time studying instead of helping his parents with their livelihood, even becoming their burden. Which is why, instead of continuing his studies, he opted to look for a job that paid a decent wage so that his parents didn't have to worry about money again.\nThat said, as he continued to build experience, he's slowly become a professional and dependable engineer.\nLately, Windflit also put together some minor technical patents from our automation technologies and a report on them, both of which Closure has already examined and approved. Windflit is hoping to send these to his parents to make their jobs easier.\nEverything is gradually taking a turn for the better, and Windflit also began to wonder whether he should continue his education. The reason that he had a change of mind is that not only has he slowly found the ability to help improve his parents lives, the experiences of the person in the biography also led him to look at things from a broader time scale. The operators of Rhodes Island, with their wide array of experiences, also showed Windflit how everyone never gave up no matter how quirky life gets. All of this encouraged him to take on the challenges he might face and pursue his dream.\nRhodes Island will sail to many more places, and there is much more for Windflit to experience.

During an unfortunate incident, Ebenholz became infected with Oripathy and had no choice but to withdraw and seek medical help at Rhodes Island.\n\n[Classified Log]\nUnfortunately, that document from Leithanien bears little resemblance to the truth.\nEbenholz was not born in Vyseheim. He lived much of his life in Urtica, a small town in disrepair.\nHe is no commoner either, at least not in Urtica. In truth, right up until he left for Rhodes Island, he was Graf Urtica. His appointed guardian issued orders as his representative, even after he came of age.\nLike other children of his social class, Ebenholz received an education indispensable to a Leithanian noble: etiquette, literature, Originium Arts, and—inseparable from and oftentimes even more important than Originium Arts—music.\nMany parents will do their utmost to hire the best music teachers, and these teachers can have a decisive influence on their charges' upbringing. There are even nobles who will judge a person's character solely by the reputation of their first music teacher.\nHowever, according to Ebenholz himself, his guardian was not very keen on following this tradition.\n'The teacher laid out a few instruments in front of me and asked me with a friendly voice which one I was interested in.\nI picked up the violin and played a little bit. He was so overjoyed by that, and kept calling me a genius, but I didn't respond to his compliments. When I saw the instruments, a barrage of foreign concepts and knowledge of how to play them flooded into my brain, as though someone was there ordering me around.\nEven so, I was pretty happy about it. It was the first time since I came to Urtica that someone showered me with praise so enthusiastically and actually meant it. Heh, even though I'd already heard so much insincere praise. Guess I never learned my lesson.\nThe next day, I met that teacher again, but he looked at me with nothing but scorn. Clearly, my representative had told him part of the truth.'\nThe HR Operator in charge of recording these logs is not familiar with the situation in Leithanien and nonchalantly asked, 'What truth?'\n'That Urtica is a territory passed down in the Witch King's lineage. In which case, what does that make Graf Urtica?'",

Those who were fed up with the Witch King's massacres turned the flames of their fury on anything and anyone related to the Witch King. Ebenholz's parents died during that period due to their distant blood relationship.\nIn turn, a minority were unhappy with the end of the old era. They resorted to all kinds of methods to resist the Twin Empresses' reign, and the most extreme of them became known as the 'Witch King's Remains.' It was they who saved Ebenholz from meeting the same fate as his parents, but in doing also dragged him into a greater maelstrom.\nIn a single sentence, Ebenholz explained what they had done to him: 'They force-fed a verse of the Voice of Mundane into my brain.'\nThe Medical Department has examined Ebenholz's brain on multiple occasions, but are as of yet unable to determine how and in what form the Voice of Mundane was implanted into it. What is certain, however, is that the Voice of Mundane is real, and causes him intense headaches. It is closely linked to Ebenholz's natural-born talent in both music and Originium Arts, but we have been unable to determine exactly what it is.\nThrough Ebenholz's introduction, we obtained copies of a research manuscript from Operator Czerny, and according to its inexact descriptions, the Voice of Mundane is a melody improvised by the Witch King and transcribed by his court musicians.\n'Then shouldn't the Voice of Mundane be sheet music, or some kind of tape?'\n'What do you think? Did they cram paper or plastic into my brain?'\nIn the end, the Medical Department had no choice but to tentatively accept Ebenholz's own explanation:\n'It's a melody, a great melody. A melody so great that it makes me worry that I'll be swallowed whole without even noticing.'\n'Can a melody really swallow a person?'\n'All I can say is... I'll do my best to prevent it from happening again.'\nEver since, Ebenholz has refused to discuss the topic.",

Most operators only know him as a quiet yet courteous Leithanian operator new to Rhodes Island. Back then, Ebenholz wasn't very keen on talking to others. When by himself, he often spaced out, looking only at the cello that he always kept near him. Some operators, worried, have asked him if he needed any help, but he always simply shook his head.\nEbenholz changed after his first field operation. The operation itself could not have been more successful. Rhodes Island rescued a dozen children from extremely poor conditions in an orphanage, resettling the non-Infected at trustworthy organizations, while taking in the Infected among them.\nIt's worth noting that Ebenholz was key to the entire operation, from seeing through the orphanage manager's subterfuge to providing Originium Arts support during the actual rescue operation.\nAfter he made it back to Rhodes Island, Ebenholz began to change for the better. He started to proactively talk to those who approached him, to learn everything he could about Rhodes Island, and also to assess acrimoniously the things he could not bear to even look at. Of course, this applies only to the Doctor and a very few other operators.\nOnce, he even attended an operator-organized book club and started to exchange emails with several of them afterward.\nMost of Rhodes Island's operators did not notice this change, but there is one thing that's caught everyone's attention:\nEbenholz has stopped spacing out while looking at his cello.

Having acquired enough medical knowledge over the years, Hibiscus has been attempting to synthesize a systematic theory of healthcare based on her initial field of expertise, nutrition. The value of her current research results has been recognized even by Dr. Kal'tsit. Guided by her theories, Hibiscus has directed a gradual upgrade of the Medical Department's ward facilities. And judging by the recovery of the patients afterwards, these measures have shown clear results.\n'The idea of medical treatment isn't just to bring patients out of life-threatening situations.

Everyone came from different backgrounds, but their shared experience of 'we have to do all we can before we can put down roots here' was enough to bring them together.\nAs Hibiscus paints a picture of the peace and harmony there, colored in nostalgia, we can't help but wonder—could such a neighborhood truly exist? Especially now, years on, with the chaos Londinium has been through, we fear that even if that block was once reality, it's long since been reduced to ruins.\nPerhaps she's seeing these things through rose-tinted glasses. Perhaps she was simply lucky, and this Sarkaz girl with no concept of prejudice found friendly faces in her first contact outside her household. Regardless, these earliest memories have become the simplest, yet staunchest grounds Hibiscus has for believing in goodwill.

His fingers are unusually long, allowing him to span 11ths with ease; thus, many of his pieces tend to be quite taxing to perform. Even so, this doesn't stop the people of the Afterglow from playing his magnum opuses with full enthusiasm, day after day.\nLate night in the Afterglow, when babes in the cradle refuse to sleep, it is his lullabies sung at their sides. When lovers embrace in gentle dance under the streetlamps, it is his serenades that guide them. When old faces pass on in serenity, it is his requiems sounding by their coffins. Being ill with Oripathy, Czerny only infrequently goes outdoors, but when he does, every note he inks flows in the steps of traveling singers, crossing endless rolling mountains and rushing rivers, to places further and further beyond.\nIn the bright-lit ballrooms of the Afterglow, ensembles played Czerny's dances all throughout the night, but he himself had no interest in such venues; his focus was mostly spilled into sheet after disorderly sheet of staves. At times, he'd do nothing all day, simply sitting at his desk in silence. Nobody could blame him for it, for everyone knew that that was everything sustaining him.\nDuring the Vyseheim incident, Czerny's life was at one point gravely endangered, but it was that near-death experience that changed his mind and had him join Rhodes Island, which gave him the opportunity to leave Leithanien. Ever since, a land far wider than the Afterglow, than Leithanien herself, has been slowly unfolding before his eyes. Henceforth, no longer has that cramped little desk contained his thirsts, the yearnings for faraway lands roaring through Czerny's mind without abate.",

              "storyText": "Before analyzing any piece of music, we must also conduct an in-depth analysis of the composer's experiences achievements. As we all know, William Czerny was born to a renowned family of musicians from the Afterglow. His mother Hayley Czerny raised him alone after his father passed away while he was young. As a pianist well-versed in musical theory, Hayley tuned pianos for a living following her husband's death.\nAs she had no one to take care of him, she often brought her son to work. Although many of her customers were talented pianists, all of them without exception were amazed by the young Czerny's extraordinary talents. And as he had yet to formally study piano, many of them taught him everything they knew.\nHayley died of illness when Czerny was fourteen, and he became infected with Oripathy by accident while dealing with her funeral arrangements. He had no choice but to abandon his plans to attend a music academy in Leithanien's capital, and instead studied under a famous local composer in the Afterglow. There, he met his teacher's eldest daughter. Her name is unknown, and all we know about her from our interviews with him is that Czerny sees her as a lifelong friend, and that she possessed great musical talent as well, but not only did their rivalry never get in the way of their friendship, it made them all the more inseparable as they appreciated each other's talent.\nThose wondrous days lasted six years, and Czerny had already become a performer of great renown by then. However, no amount of being in the spotlight could have illuminated the dark fate that shrouded him at the time. When he was twenty, his dear friend died of her worsening Oripathy symptoms. Shocked, the great musician was unable to recover from this setback and turned to the creative process to release the pain in his heart. After shutting himself in for a year, the world was introduced to his magnum opus, 'Morgen und Abend'—the piece today's lecture is on.\nThis 'Morgen und Abend' elevated its composer to the top ranks of Leithanian musicians, yet behind it was a pain so great that it swallowed the composer whole. This great pain tore open a deep, deep fissure in his iron-like body, and it is through this fissure that his soft, inner self finally caught a glimpse of the true face of the outer world.\n...I suppose I should leave it at that. Let's listen to this piece ourselves.\n—Excerpt from the lecture records of Leithanien's top music academy's music appreciation course's fourth session.",

Using myself as an example, I ran into quite a but of trouble when I first studied Originium Arts during my formative years. I spent months making no progress at all. However, I later realized that Leithanien's Originium Arts system goes hand in hand with its music, and my musical gifts were like a rich mineral deposit waiting to be mined. Which is why I immediately adjusted my study plan and banished from my thoughts all the basic theories I'd read in the books. Instead, I applied the music theory I had mastered directly to my Originium Arts, in the end greatly improving my learning efficiency while putting in only half the work.\nSecondly, a person's Originium Arts education is of great value to our research on the role music plays in the Leithanian Originium Arts system. Leithanien's top Casters are almost without exception great musicians, and monumental musical works often led to breakthroughs in Arts development throughout Leithanien's classical Arts development history. It is also evident when looking at their history that the two's developments closely align with one another. Whenever Arts development reached a high point, a golden age of music occurred at either the same time or shortly after. Likewise, whenever the development of music stagnated, so too did the development of Arts.\nMy research has progressed far enough for me to draw the conclusion that the results our young operators achieve every step of the way are closely tied to the breakthroughs in their musical education. Further research should be able to illuminate the specific role that music plays.\nFinally, I would like to note that music has widespread applications in the Originium Arts across all of Leithanien. In particular, in the Afterglow we have a unique medical Arts system for dealing with Oripathy, and its effectiveness has been proven by my protracted experiments. Naturally, if you are able to provide me with more funding, I can immediately put this research project on the agenda.\n\n—Excerpt from Operator Czerny's 'Research Funding Application'",

The sandy barrenlands became her most familiar sight during childhood, and her mother's fellow Pioneers became the people she was closest to besides her parents. She liked to write about each member of the Pioneer Team in her diary, and saw them all as irreplaceable family members.\nAs the descendant of Pioneers, Dorothy's mother also became a Pioneer who worked in the wastes, but evidently she did not want her daughter following in her footsteps. Dorothy had demonstrated extraordinary talent since childhood, with her grades in school far exceeding those of other children her age. Her parents were elated, and they worked hard to pay for her schooling and save for her college tuition so she would never have cause to worry financially. In today's Columbia, as long as someone has enough talent, they have the opportunity to leap up the social ladder, even the children of Pioneers. There is no way but up for the gifted. Of course, this also means that those without the qualifications already have their lives set in stone. However, at the very least, her parents truly believed that she had a much brighter future than theirs ahead of her.\nDorothy went on to meet their expectations as she grew up, her excellence obvious to all those around her. Her family celebrated when she received Ironforge Polytechnic's invitation to participate in its summer camp, not knowing that this would be the last time they would all be together. Dorothy's mother was killed along with many of her Pioneer Team members when a Catastrophe struck the temporary base they were in.\nDorothy's father tried very hard to console his distressed daughter, but was largely unable to do so.

So even while she is looking out for others, she is often in pretty bad shape herself.\nThose who've worked with her before at Rhine Lab have long since gotten used to how worrying she can be. Operator Astgenne often proactively takes on the responsibility of caring for her, which Dorothy always seems a little embarrassed about. But sometimes, she drops her big sister-like facade and opens her eyes wide like a little girl, making all kinds of tiny, inconsequential requests of Astgenne.\nThat said, based on Operator Silence's observations and reports, it is also worth pointing out that Dorothy can be somewhat biased in her viewpoints, especially when it comes to ideas like 'protecting everyone' and 'making everyone happy.' When these topics are brought up in conversation, she can sometimes suffer minor emotional breakdowns. This deep-rooted obsession grew out of her family's situation and is not so easy to defuse.",

It was not until she jumped ship from a government research institute, along with her projects, that the tech company heavily supported by the Columbian government formed its Originium Art Section, thus creating its ten-section structure.\nAt Rhine Lab, Dorothy's relationship with the other section directors is not bad in general. At the very least, they are able to stay amicable enough on the surface. Even Ferdinand, generally known to be difficult to get along with, has given her plenty of assistance with her research. Although she was aware that his help came at a high price, no price was too high when she was about to achieve her dream.\n\n[Voice Log]\n'Yes, I was the last one to join. Kirsten, Saria, Ferdinand, and Parvis were the original members.'\n'Oh, I guess that might cause confusion. It was Kirsten and Saria who started the company. Ferdinand and Parvis were the first ones to join them.'\n'Just like me, they brought their projects with them. Rhine Lab has always been taking in members like us. All of us have stable, workable projects. Kirsten gave us a platform, and we gave back to the company with our results.'\n'It was Kirsten who approached me back then. She understood my research, and was willing to give me the support I needed. When they hired me, the project that Parvis handed to Olivia had just gone wrong... Oh, it's not as bad as it sounds. An experiment had failed, that's all.'\n'The company was in a huge mess because of Director Saria. That was the first time I saw Kirsten like that. Perhaps that was when Ferdinand started coming up with his plans.'\n'As for what happened this time... Ferdinand's got his own ideas, and I'm not in a position to judge his actions when I was also involved.'\n'Parvis? Hm...'\n'Most of the time, he's very easy to talk to. He doesn't offend anyone. You could have tea with him, listen to music, and it's all fine.'\n'But Parvis is a researcher, too. So is Ferdinand, so is Kirsten. And so am I.'\n'Well, I really didn't want to put it this way, but...'\n'Doctor, I'm sure you know what I mean. We're so alike, after all.'",

Nonetheless, behind that sincerity lies an element of danger, which we must not underestimate simply because this researcher possesses a warm smile, an attentive gaze, and genuine concern for others. Even though the crisis caused by the experiment has died down and Operator Dorothy has not displayed any dangerous tendencies, we must be aware of the fact that she never has and never will stray from her purpose.\n—She truly wishes for everyone to equally find happiness.\nEven during her college years, she was already paying close attention to some of Loken Williams's research. From this, we can surmise that whenever Loken gave lectures at the university, Dorothy was likely sitting there in the audience, and was thus influenced by some of his ideals. In particular, her similar attitude towards experimental ethics can be seen in the recent incident. We can only guess what kind of role Rhine Lab had in the 'Loken Watertank' incident, and moreover what kind of part Dorothy herself played. However, none of our guesses are particularly optimistic.\nIt's also worth noting that it was Operator Saria who first expressed her opinion on Dorothy's onboarding even though she had interacted with her the least during their time at Rhine Lab.\n'I know people like her.'\nSaria reminded us, 'Be careful. They're the kind of people who will do whatever it takes to achieve what they consider beautiful.'",

While this is nothing unusual, it's not all that common either, given how strenuous the elite operators' missions are.\nMechanist simply dismissed it as a natural turn of events, though.

This breakthrough single-handedly solved the problem of the high cost of Originium Arts conductors and accelerated the economization of Originium energy, while also improving its safety and ease of use.\nThanks to this technology, a wide range of products that require a stable supply of Originium energy have become available on the market. These include lighting equipment that has no risk of explosion and no need for high maintenance costs, something that we now take for granted.

              "storyText": "The Urbicas descend from a long line of Gaulish astrologers who emigrated to the Columbian South after being ostracized by the orthodox astrologers there, and thus unwittingly escaped the destruction of Gaul. They are now an enormous family that possesses significant social prestige, and the sisters Astesia and Astgenne are among the family's newest generation.\nTheir parents had an arranged marriage, but nonetheless loved each other deeply, and it wasn't long after their marriage before their mother became pregnant. Their father then used his astrological research to predict their future, and found that they might only have a single child in this lifetime. As such, he picked a grandiloquent name for their only daughter: Astesia.\nWhich is why he was completely blindsided when on the day his wife gave birth, they ended up with two baby girls. Regardless, he was overjoyed, and named his unexpected younger daughter Astgenne in the hopes that, just like the stars, she would come to be the genesis of the family's good fortune.\nAstgenne has been fond of learning from a young age. Although she does not possess her sister's ability to intuit and learn by inference, she made up for it with hard work and diligence. Because of this, even during their childhood her Originium Arts were far more radiant than her sister's, and her mastery of astrological lore flabbergasted even their father. In his words, she 'could've become a pillar of the family's bright future alongside her sister.'\nBut she didn't.\nAstgenne first started to change because of a broken astrolabe. She came upon her parents, two experienced astrologers, throwing out an astrolabe that could still be repaired in favor of buying a new one. That was when she discovered how impractical the knowledge she had been studying truly was. She couldn't tell her parents, 'we can still use this if we get it fixed,' so instead she brought it back to her room, poured over a few instruction manuals and assembly guides, took it apart, talked to the craftsman who made it, and finally repaired it after tinkering with it for a few months. She then showed the globe to her sister, who happily took it, praised her handiwork, and shared candy with her. But when she showed it to her parents, she was met with only cold, harsh responses:\n'Why did you waste your time on this hunk of junk?'\n'Astgenne, I want you to spend your time on things that matter.'\nShe quietly went back to her room and looked at the rows and rows of astrological literature on her shelf. Then, she looked out the window at the endless nomadic city plates, and that was when she finally realized.\nIt didn't matter how well she knew the stars' periods, or how confidently she could tell those around her about their distant, impractical changes. This field of study does not benefit the lands whatsoever. If she continued to study her family's pointless chicanery, she would simply become a stargazing con artist who couldn't even fix her own equipment. What she really wanted to master was the thing that could truly make the world a better place. What her father saw as useless trash.\nScience.\nFrom that day forward, Astgenne lost interest in the astrology lessons from her parents and teachers. Instead, she shifted her focus to her classes at school. She tried to use her good grades to prove that she made the right choice, but her parents' disdain toward this only made her more stubborn. Considering her temperament, if it weren't for Astesia calming her down, she probably would've immediately left home without a second thought. In the end, after she received an acceptance letter from a university and made sure that she had enough savings and a stable source of income, she moved out for good, never to return to the home that had tormented her for so long. To prepare herself for a new life, she also gave herself a new name when she enrolled at college: Elena.\nShe didn't want to be an illusory, insignificant star. She wanted to become a shining light.",

              "storyText": "As the land's leading tech company, Rhine Lab's hiring standards are stringent enough to discourage most would-be applicants. Even Elena, with her double degrees, wouldn't be worth mentioning in that corporation full of people with master's degrees and PhDs doing odd jobs. Fortunately—or at least some would say so—she had a good teacher. Even in college, she had already been participating in Rhine Lab Energy Section Director Ferdinand's experiments. Seizing this opportunity, Elena worked and studied under the industry groundbreaker for years, at last becoming his proud protégé. It goes without saying how painstaking and laborious this process was. Ferdinand had several dozen researchers working under him, and the students he taught as a guest lecturer likely numbered in the thousands. Naturally, Ferdinand took notice of Elena due to her academic accomplishments, but what really made him take a liking to her was her decisiveness and quick response under extreme circumstances.\nA few years prior, a disastrous liquid Originium leak occurred in the Energy Section's laboratories. At the time, the main Energy Section members were working away from Rhine HQ, and the Defense Section dealt with the incident according to their contingency plan. However, the leak affected other departments, and there were multiple experiments that, once shut down, had to have their materials disposed of lest they become an even more dangerous problem, which greatly slowed the rescue process. If it weren't for Elena, who was merely an intern at the time, taking on the responsibility to explain to Defense Director Saria the situation at the accident site and even leading the rescue, Ferdinand would likely have had an even greater mess on his hands. Of course, thinking only of saving others, Elena headed into the high-risk environment without a full set of safety equipment, and this left her infected with Oripathy. As for her sister Astesia, Elena brought her into a safe house when the accident occurred, but after they made physical contact, Astesia began to show signs of developing Oripathy. They were then transported to Rhodes Island for treatment together.\n\n'We have yet to understand the specific causes of developing Oripathy. It's only in recent years that we've even identified cases of this exceedingly rare form of infection. We have managed to narrow down a few commonalities though: the patients are all the identical twins of an already infected patient, with whom they've learned and used the same kind of Originium Arts since childhood. They also all shared a close emotional bond, and experienced a strong emotional fluctuation when they came into physical contact with their newly infected twin. And, speculatively, time and space may also play a factor, as in all cases the patients had physical contact with their twins within hours of their infection. So far, we have not found any cases where this occurred after more time had passed, or where a patient suddenly became infected from afar.'\n'How many cases have there been?'\n'Just one on the landship, and two reported from our branches across the lands.'\n'That's way too few. Even trying to speculate based on that sample size may be overzealous.'\n'This sort of infection is rare to begin with. We can only work with the data we have.'\n'I know you're in a hurry to get results, and to give the people suffering out there a treatment plan, but please. You're not usually this reckless. Look, we have plenty of cases where an Infected infects others with Originium Arts because of their emotional outbursts, and we also have cases of patients becoming infected after prolonged exposure to their family members.'\n'Well, that just lends credence—'\n'It means that every single guess of yours can be accounted for by other special cases.'\n'...... (Annoyed sigh)'\n'Oripathy is not a normal disease. The kind of logic that works with other diseases doesn't apply here.'\n'...I won't give up.'\n'Of course you won't, but before that, I want you to come up with a treatment plan for these patients.'\n'All done. Three files on your desk, all ready to go.'\n'Thanks, good work.'\n......\n'Anything else?'\n'I'm just thinking that if science and logic can't explain these patients' Oripathy, then maybe it's time for a different approach.'\n'What do you mean?'\n'I heard the Rhodes Island case comes from a family of astrologers. Maybe common logic won't work here, maybe we need to appeal to the supernatural. Their father once predicted that he would only have one daughter. What if his prophecy wasn't wrong?'\n'You're still just making wild guesses... but if you're so sure about this, do as you please.'\n—Selected excerpts from a meeting between high-clearance medic operators, Medical Department Meeting Room",

However, during the 'Site 359 Incident' she began to see her parents in him—a distrusting control freak who uses his position to harass others. Once, she'd done everything she could to escape from people like that, and now, after drifting about for over a decade, she found herself in the same hole as before. Which is why, at that very moment, she decided to cut ties with her boss/mentor and later requested a transfer to Rhodes Island, back to where her sister was. Only here could she calm down and think about her future. She is very lost right now. Her research had all come to nothing thanks to Ferdinand's sudden disappearance and the changes happening to the Energy Section. Her ten years of hard work have been frozen with no hopes of restarting anytime soon. She must feel like an Originium slug breeder who opened the door one day to find all the slugs missing. She may remember all the technical details, but even if it's replicable, Rhodes Island simply does not have the resources she would need. Besides, she is an operator now. She has new responsibilities and missions, and so much more to do...\nBut from another perspective, Elena also feels that life isn't as painful as it used to be. Her new life, new encounters, and the diverse array of personnel aboard Rhodes Island will support her in her many insignificant but productive research projects. Rhodes Island's administrator also seems very efficient and professional. This time, she's made sure that <i>this</i> Doctor is trustworthy. And most importantly, she gets to live right by her sister in the dorms now.\nShe's finally home.",

Sometimes, she can be so critical that she gets flicked in the forehead by her sister. Yet there is one thing she has to admit. The training she received as a child did benefit her a little.\nThe Urbica twins' Originium Arts may originate from the same source, but nonetheless unfold quite differently. Astesia's Arts emphasize complexity, while Astgenne's focus on simplicity. Sometimes, all she has to do is wave her staff a little, and the silk-like energy beams can lift your spirits for an entire day. With such a flashy baseline, naturally they can also paralyze wrongdoers. What's less obvious is that as long as she adjusts the parameters correctly, even the seemingly harmless energy beams can immediately become intensely focused, enough to send a stalwart Forte to the hospital for half a month.\nAstgenne loves hanging out at the workshop. She may not be a professional artificer, but as someone who often makes use of their services, her professionalism is beyond doubt. Sometimes, she also uses the workshop to tinker with her own things. If she's not fixing her own staff, she's usually adjusting her sister's astrolabe. In the past, she used to do this for her in exchange for pocket money, but now it is a symbol of their close relationship. They may walk different paths, but the sisters continue to encourage and depend on each other. Without Astesia's prudence and thoroughness, Astgenne can be reckless. But without Astgenne's decisiveness and perseverance, Astesia can be quite indecisive, too. They are different, and they depend on each other. Perhaps that's the best way to sum up these twins' relationship.",

Although the origins of such absurd rumors cannot be ascertained, Operator Tomimi seemed to really take a liking to them, and added her own fuel to the fire as the story mutated.\nTomimi's personal interests aside, the fact is that it was Operator Eunectes who forged Gavial's new equipment. When the two of them received Tomimi's message that Acahualla could be facing a disaster, Gavial made the request for new gear. Eunectes then quickly fabricated the entire set, from the weapons and armor to even the accessories, out of the finest materials, yet it is the imposing yet easy-to-wield battleaxe that Gavial instantly took a liking to.",

Fortunately, thanks to the combined efforts of the local residents and the Rhodes Island Operators present, the Zeruertza citizens were all able to evacuate to the surface before it was too late, and no lives were lost during the incident.\nIt's worth mentioning that Gavial played a pivotal leadership role during the handling of the crisis. She was the first to propose having the Durins evacuate to the surface, persuaded the plan's opponents, was one of the last to evacuate, and even maintained order when the Durins built their settlement on the surface, ensuring that the construction would be completed on time.

Not that she's become more melancholic or moody or anything like that, but she's now more confident and talkative than ever, and enjoys talking about her homeland more.\nTo be clear, she's never had anything against talking about her hometown, even back when she first joined Rhodes Island. However, she simply viewed it as the place she was from, and nothing more. She had no reason to avoid the topic, but also no reason to bring it up, so if Rhodes Island wasn't going to dig any deeper, she would naturally have no reason to ever discuss Acahualla.\nYet ever since her bizarre rainforest vacation, Rhodes Island has started to see more and more Acahuallan Operators join its ranks, and Gavial has started to open up about her home more as well, which has led to us learning more about the region by the day. This was a forest that was once considered no man's land, but is home to all sorts of tribes, big and small—such as the battle-obsessed Tiacauh. However, it has also been slowly and irreversibly industrializing... and has now seen several hundred thousand Durins pouring in from underground. With all these factors coming together, even the planner with the greatest foresight in the world would find themselves struck with a headache when trying to imagine Acahualla's future.\nBut Gavial doesn't think so at all.\nIn her eyes, she, Tomimi, Zumama, Inam, and all the valiant Tiacauh will be able to overcome any challenges that Acahualla might face. She has her friends' complete, unreserved trust, and she too wholeheartedly trusts her friends. No matter how difficult the path forward is, even if she must really break open a waterfall at the tallest cliff in Acahualla, that wouldn't be entirely unrealistic with her friends' full support. And so, why not take pride in her homeland?\nOf course, there's little she can do about the fact that her friends trusts her fists far more than her medical acumen.

Thanks to their ingenious camouflage, they have thus far been able to hide Acahualla's industrialization from the agents of Sargon's rulers, even causing them to return to the court prior to the arrival of the first wave of Durins. This has led to Inam successfully receiving recognition as Acahualla's lord ameer, earning her equal standing with the other lords ameer who thirst for territory, population, and production capacity, and thus ensuring Acahualla's laws and principles remain intact, all while keeping Sargon's highest ranks oblivious to the changes that the territory has seen.\nIf both the surface Tiacauh and the underground Durins are able to live alongside each other peacefully, the status quo should last for a very long time. However, there is no going back to Zeruertza. The sudden surge in population will undoubtedly exhaust Acahualla's resources at a dramatic pace, and Eunectes's tribe has already benefited greatly from Durin technologies. In the long term, there is no way the changes that have occurred in Acahualla can stay hidden forever. There will come a day when they must confront these external pressures.\nIt's hard to say just how much thought Gavial had given the idea before she suggested the Durins evacuate to the surface, but she evidently understood the gravity and responsibility that the decision entailed. Otherwise, considering how rarely she does so, she would not have hesitated like she did when the Acahualla lord ameer candidacy was being decided. She is, after all, a member of Rhodes Island's Medical Department. She would be in quite a difficult position if she had to choose between her ideal of treating her patients and the future of Acahualla.\nIn her time of need, her friends stepped up and helped her out of her predicament, but that doesn't mean Gavial gave up on balancing the scales. She simply chose the most comfortable and suitable solution for both herself and Acahualla.\nIf anyone has any doubts about this conclusion, they can very well pay Acahualla a visit themselves and listen to its people sing Gavial's praises, gaze upon the monument in the center of Acahualla that's growing both larger and further from completion every day, and get a feel for themselves just how much unity Gavial's name can bring to Acahualla. And that's not even counting her own personal strength.\nIf Acahualla ever finds itself facing some kind of nigh insurmountable threat, Gavial will undoubtedly drop everything to return to her homeland and forge a new path, with her fists and battleaxe.",

As a Lupo serving as a Durin city's literature representative, there had to be a story behind it.\nOur hunch was right, but Pozëmka is also extremely cautious around most non-Durin operators. While very courteous, she never reveals anything unnecessary. All the operators who came back from Zeruertza have apparently been told her backstory, but they all tacitly avoid going into the subject.\nAfter a very long time, Pozëmka finally went briefly into her past before making it to Zeruertza: she used to be the daughter of an Ursus noble, and her family members all died one after another in a despicable political conspiracy. She was the only one fortunate enough to make it out alive, and, completely by chance, managed to stumble her way to Zeruertza.\nShe told us all this very calmly without going into any of the finer details, but her ice-cold tone clearly conveyed to us the pain, disillusionment, and horrors she had suffered.\nSince then, she has lived in Zeruertza for years, enjoying a peace and quiet that she could only have dreamt of in the past, until Zeruertza's everlasting summer finally came to an end. Not only did the carefree Durins play no small part in soothing the pain left by her experiences, they also allowed her to stay in the city as one of their own. However, she too began to hold an almost prejudiced distrust towards anything created by non-Durins (or 'surface-dwellers'), from their works of culture to industrial products.\nThis is not her fault, much less the Durins'.",

At the time, she preferred to take strolls, space out as she sat alone in an open area, or write something—in other words, she wasn't the kind of person who worried about others.\nThat all changed when she came to Rhodes Island. Pozëmka has started to pay careful attention to all aspects of our Durin operators' lifestyles: if they are eating well, if they are working too long, whether their equipment is properly sorted out before field operations, etc. Even Minimalist, who's known to be particularly difficult, had no choice but to admit next to his bucket full of pencils: 'The other day I complained about not having even pencils, and she immediately got me all these... I probably haven't been giving her enough credit before.'\nPozëmka isn't ashamed to confess her reasons either: 'I'll admit that Rhodes Island is a good place, but it can never truly fulfill the needs of a Durin like Zeruertza did. I do this because I'm worried about them, and I thought I would help them take care of whatever they needed. That's all there is to it.'\nWe've tried over and over to persuade her that her excessive wardship could actually have negative consequences, that it could keep the Durin operators from adjusting to their new lives on board. In the end, we might have managed to talk her out of it, or perhaps a Durin said something to her, but she finally started to see things a little differently and stopped meddling with every aspect of their lives.\nEven so, she still spends a lot of time with the Durins, and the Durins like her, too. It is only during these moments that she finally forgoes her vigilance and relaxes.\nEventually, this relationship also expanded to the children on board Rhodes Island, but that's as far as it ever progressed.\n\nI'm <i>not</i> playing with toy blocks!

Unlike the Zeruertza Durins' disorganized language, her advertising copy always stood out from the competition, and thanks to her masterful use of exoticism (to the Durins, at least), she always grabbed their attention in no time. There was no need to worry about not getting enough orders with her writing your advertisements.\nPozëmka also writes literature—poems, novels, and plays—when she is not working on her commercial writings. Unlike her simple, straightforward advertising copy, the native Zeruertzan citizens tend to have a hard time understanding her plots and metaphors. Hunger, cold, conspiracy, and murder... These nouns are simply too unrelatable to the Durins. Even if they can by instinct recognize that conspiracy means plotting against someone, the most objectionable conspiracy they can think of is adding half a bottle of vinegar to someone else's mead.\nTo Pozëmka, these two things have become the manifestation of a certain kind of contradiction. The exaggerated, fanciful marketing language represents the Durins' carefree lifestyle, while her ice-cold, gory literature ties her back to the past that she cannot bear to face. The Durins like the former, and so does she, but she has yet to be able to convince herself to not spend her free time on the latter.\nInstead, she's started to deliberately use different tools for her different writing tasks: she uses her typewriter exclusively for marketing copy, while she opts for a fountain pen and ink for her more personal creations.\nIt's worth mentioning that when she participates in battle as a field operator, Pozëmka's two weapons of choice are both also derived from fountain pens and typewriters. She came into possession of her crossbow because of miscommunication when she first arrived in Zeruertza; it was actually a fountain pen that she wanted—and indeed the biggest piece of furniture in her dorm room right now is a fountain pen showcase—yet the Durin artificer made her a crossbow instead. As for her <i>typewriter</i>, it was modified by our Engineering Operators after she came to Rhodes Island. According to her, 'my guess is this typewriter won't see much use from now on. I'll be living on the surface and fighting plenty of battles. In which case, I might as well use it as a weapon.'\nNevertheless, even aboard Rhodes Island, Pozëmka still receives requests to write advertising copy and slogans from time to time. While her typewriter can no longer produce words, she continues to accept these requests with pleasure. With her fountain pen, she plans out her ideas and writes her drafts. The final results that her clients receive are completely different from what she used to write in Zeruertza, with only her vivid rhetoric unchanged.",

It is hard to assign responsibility for events in the past; Cantabile says that she used to feel like there was no such thing as an innocent Bolívarian, but that she later grew to feel that she herself is the greatest culprit. Tormented by fear and guilt, she wanted atone for her sins with her life.\nShe says, however, that she has realized that dying in the slums would not have changed anything; she would use the life we saved to atone, and to walk a new path that she was only beginning to see.

Although this is not unheard of among new operators and those with a strong sense of responsibility, Cantabile took this beyond all reasonable limits. If a mission involved helping Infected workers, for example, she would look up the family history of the factory owner. She would also write long, non-compliant mission reports afterward, including extraneous details such as her investigation into the previous history of the target. She comes to her own conclusions regarding what is needed of her and how she should complete a mission, listing out various possibilities and compulsively warning herself not to use force except under extreme circumstances.\nCantabile's reports have improved after many corrections and instructions regarding her non-compliant writing style and actions, but her obsessive compulsions did not stop. Her quarters are filled with rejected drafts detailing her thoughts, with various possibilities listed out in increasing detail, and she's even been reprimanded for refusing to carry weapons on a mission.\nHer strongest reaction occurred after she accidentally caused an injury. Although the testimony of other operators at the scene absolved Cantabile of all blame, she chose to punish herself by starvation upon returning to HQ, an act that seems to have special significance for her. She was found by medics who noticed that something was not right and forcibly put her on IV, and was temporarily suspended from field operations.\nAnother noteworthy incident, albeit happier, occurred when Cantabile saved a young child for the first time. She began to tremble uncontrollably as she gave water and food to the malnourished child, and reported feeling that she was fortunate for the first time in her life, trusting in herself and Rhodes Island to help the child, and to give her a better future with freedom of choice.",

No matter how urgent the situation, his pencil must be wiped clear of dust and secured behind his ear, lest it bump into any corner of his body. Every time he does this, the medic who completed the handover with Gavial's team on the initial field mission would put on an expression that says, 'I told you so.'\nOn the other hand, Minimalist's talent for design is beyond question. His interior design proposals are simple but effective, and many have reluctantly admitted that they have gained useful inspiration from his incessant nagging.

He knows he should ask for help, but would instead drag things on for days. And when he finally makes a decision, the state of his hair will reflect the scale of the issue as he goes off on various unrelated tangents until he finally, reluctantly, talks about the problem.\nSome operators have reported this to Closure: when helping someone else with a design, he struts like a fowlbeast that caught a dozen slugs that morning, but he has great difficulty asking for help when he runs into trouble himself. Perhaps it is a matter of pride—which is not a bad thing for a designer—but Minimalist needs to learn that anyone can run into problems, no matter how good they are, and that he should accept that rather than deny it.\n'He can be pretty docile in that state.

He did his best with the time he had, left the city where he grew up in slumber, and awoke to the sights and sounds of Acahualla. Most of the former residents of Zeruertza stayed with the tribespeople and began to build a new home, while Minimalist and a few other Infected came to Rhodes Island for treatment.\nHe rarely brings up Zeruertza, nor does he display much in the way of homesickness. Like many other former Zeruertzans, Minimalist's outlook is optimistic, believing that they will find a new home. He cannot help but feel a pang of regret, however, that the recognition that he finally earned must be buried underground, never again to see the light of day. At first, he wanted to help rebuild the new home. Whatever time he had left, he would use it, as the current Design Representative, to help the people of Zeruertza build a sustainable city. The plan eventually fell through, not because the Zeruertzans did not want to burden him with the responsibility, but because most of them were too busy enjoying their new lives on the surface to work together. So he accepted Gavial's proposal, and traveled to Rhodes Island to receive treatment for his Oripathy, somewhat to his chagrin.\nMinimalist looked back at the rainforest on the day he departed. Lightrace had left to find his teacher, and the Zeruertzans had begun to build a scattering of temporary dwellings. Minimalist told Gavial that he expected his trip to Rhodes Island to be temporary, that someday, he'd return to build a home that everyone would be happy with.",

The Engineering Department hoped that the assignment would improve his approach, while also making preparations in case anything unexpected came up. As expected, Minimalist's face fell when he saw the storage space, but he surprisingly refrained from the long tirade that he might have went on under normal circumstances. Instead, he calmly accepted the assignment, and began working on a draft. One month later, Minimalist submitted a design that far exceeded expectations: the space was thoroughly reorganized, and areas previously wasted were put to good use. He went around the various departments that used the items kept there, working out their optimal method of storage, and discussing the design with other engineers. Each iteration took less and less time, the entire process went smoothly, and he was in good spirits.\nMinimalist did not explain the surprising result, only expressing that he is enjoying designing on his own now because he wanted to see his teacher again, and to show them that he is strong, independent, and at peace.\nWe do not understand what happened between Minimalist and his teacher, or how Gavial changed him, but at least he seems to be in a good place right now. In one instance, when Minimalist realized that he had not felt pain for a while after undergoing treatment, he opened a barrel of Zeruertza berry tomato wine for the first time and enjoyed it in his quarters, feeling that time has slowed down, and that he had begun to understand why his fellows want to enjoy life to the fullest.\nSince then, a change can be observed in Minimalist's designs: his quarters, for example, have begun to incorporate more gentle lines and colors other than white, as well as furniture with what he used to call 'meaningless' and 'aesthetically unsound' features.\nIn Gavial's words, they are finally suitable for habitation.",

However, by piecing together the clues that they invariably let slip, it can be determined that Xiaohei and his friend Ah Gen have an extremely special ability to cast Arts without the use of Originium, and this ability—that they call 'Spirit Ability'—has never been recorded in any official Terran records. This attracted many curious operators to attempt to learn it as well, but without exception they all failed to do so.\nIt appears that Xiaohei's Spirit Ability can not only alter the physical properties of metals and freely manipulate them at high speeds, he can also track enemies based on the position of metallic objects and cause interference by vibrating metal pieces to create noise. Besides this, he also has an astonishing long-range teleportation ability, which lets him quickly change his and other operators' location in a short amount of time.

It can be inferred that the Nearl family's traditional training practices were sufficient to develop his mastery over the weapons commonly used by knights. As a young man, Młynar frequently followed his father, Kirill Nearl, and his team of campaign knights as an apprentice, giving him the opportunity to accumulate combat experience under the wings of a great many outstanding knights.\nHowever, whenever he puts down his training knight shield and picks up his sword, it becomes immediately clear to everyone nearby that the sword <i>is</i> his weapon. In most historied knight families, when a young man comes of age, he often chooses to once again leave home to improve his techniques and disposition, before joining a knight order to serve Kazimierz. However, having already mastered the sword during his time as a wanderer, Młynar set himself on a different path.\n...As for his Originium Arts, from what I've heard, knights never use Arts during a duel unless their beliefs are on the line. That said, during his test, he did show us his Arts just once.\nWe've seen Nearl and Blemishine's Arts. They are always as radiant as can be, possibly scorching, unadulterated. To our surprise, though, Operator Młynar's Arts initially felt gentle, even loving. However, upon realizing the anger the flow of his golden light embodied, we had to immediately stop him from drawing his sword, so as to minimize the repair work needed after his test.",

Not long after he came aboard Rhodes Island and signed his agreement, he made his way back to Kazimierz. However, he did not immediately report to Rhodes Island's Kawalerielki office. In addition, he tendered his letter of resignation to his former employer in the Grand Knight Territory by mail.\nClearly, there are many in the city who view Młynar as a threat, and we can also surmise from his own account that a number of recent incidents he was involved in have affected the interests of certain individuals. Still, the retrial of a misjudged case, or the downfall of a few companies and nobles, are hardly significant in this city. At this point, rather than being concerned by all the attacks, open or covert, against his family, perhaps it's more fitting to say that having stayed in this city for ten years, he no longer feels that fighting these forces will accomplish anything.\n'We were honored to have his help during an operation. He wasn't as difficult to work with as I expected. By which I mean I thought he'd be a bossy, arrogant noble, or maybe someone who strictly followed the traditional rules of chivalry... but he simply listened and promised to give you a hand before you screwed up too badly. The only thing we had to get used to is that he never calls anyone by their codename. I mean, we do have a good number of Kazimierzian operators who use their titles from the Major as their codenames, so maybe he's got a grudge against that, but it's not that weird if you ask me.\n'...That said, it's hard not to feel bad if you make a mistake while working with him. That time, I almost screwed up the entire mission, and after that we let him make all the decisions.\n'He gives smooth, efficient plans. It doesn't seem like he cares whether you can actually follow them or not, though. I remember him asking us to split up to stop a couple commercial knights from tailing us. How were we supposed to find them? How would we stop them? Can we knock them out? Is it okay if we blow the roads up? He didn't discuss any of that with us.\n'I guess he's probably more used to working alone? I mean, all of us did our own thing and finished our own objectives with no communication whatsoever, and somehow it all just worked out... I'm really curious. What kind of man does it take to get used to doing things the way he does? And what got him doing things like that in the first place?'",

The two of them rose to prominence twenty-five years ago when they fought under the same knight order's banner during the campaign knights' invasion of Ursus, with Schnitz taking over command during a crucial battle when the knight captain was gravely injured, and leaving a deep impression on the soldiers from both sides. However, that was their last notable accomplishment. Their disappearance without a trace over a decade ago seems to have marked a turning point in the fate of this generation of the Nearl family. As Rhodes Island has expressed our willingness to help locate them, Młynar agreed to have a conversation with us on the matter.\nDuring our conversation, we learned that Yolanta Nearl was also born into an established knight family and had been on good terms with the Nearls since she was young. She had originally intended to join the Silverlance Pegasus when she became a campaign knight, but Schnitz insisted that she would be more effective on the battlefield with a bow than a silverlance.\n'He arrived at that conclusion the moment she released her bowstring for the first time,' said Młynar, without elaborating further. Yolanta quickly proved Schnitz correct with her performance during the campaign, and her extraordinary talent in and understanding of Originium Arts made her particularly effective when deployed in positions overlooking the entire battlefield.\nAs for his brother Schnitz, Młynar had only this to say: 'He is my brother.'\nPerhaps it is because of how well he knew them, but despite the passage of time and the fact that everyone, including their daughters Margaret and Maria, has already accepted that they might be dead, Młynar continues to search for his brother and sister-in-law. When asked if he had any new leads, he shook his head, though it seemed his doubts on the matter were stronger than ever.",

Mieszko Industries is its biggest shareholder, and the company has had a stable fiscal performance. It has not faced any significant charges and has no obvious connections to the nobility. It's merely one of Kazimierz's countless unremarkable companies. While prevailing rumors at the time suggested that the Nearls' younger son would join either the Adeptus Sprawiedliwi or the Knights Association and eventually take over the family's Knight Primus title from the ailing Kirill, the decision that Młynar ultimately made was perhaps influenced by some external factor, or his disappointment with Kazimierz.\nBut we've met many disappointed men. The real question is what made him decide to do something <i>now</i>, and how much of his strength he's willing to lend to Rhodes Island.\nMłynar joined Rhodes Island after the Infected disturbances across the Dzwonek region. The Adeptus Sprawiedliwi successfully kept the word of the incident from spreading, thus ensuring no other forces could take advantage of this information. Młynar himself did not provide much in the way of his personal perspective on the matter. However, when HR brought this up again while organizing files, he gave an unexpected response: 'I've just always thought I needed to prove Kazimierz still has a way out.'\nMłynar has also never brought up anything to do with Operators Blemishine, Whislash, or Platinum since signing his cooperation agreement with us. Nor does he interact with Flametail and the others while in Kazimierz. There has been only one instance of Młynar, Whislash, and Blemishine having a conversation, after Whislash requested a meeting, and it lasted less than ten minutes. Although the details of that conversation are unknown, our Engineering operators told us that Blemishine suddenly seemed much more energetic, as if a weight had been lifted from her heart. Even then, Młynar didn't appear to pay much more attention to the other Kazimierzian operators than before, even though many of us are just as curious about him as we are about the Radiant Knight herself.\nIt is clear that Młynar is not looking for an answer from Rhodes Island, and perhaps he does not even believe that there is an answer out there. But when he assisted us with a string of Infected problems, he displayed a sense of responsibility that definitely did not seem to come from respect towards his work. Some may believe the Land of Knights has no more room for knightly fantasies, and that the endless waves will eventually consume its cities, but how can anyone know how the next story will be written, and where the next city will be built, until they are completed?",

When she answered affirmatively, she was told that they would hide a key piece of evidence until the hearing was halfway through. She was then to claim that 'the inspection agency has just finished analyzing the data,' at which point her mentor would enter the courtroom and deliver the new piece of evidence: a repaired recording of a conversation. With it, Proviso was able to discredit the witness's testimony and place responsibility on the secretary, who had been blinded by the huge amount of money involved. He was found guilty and sentenced to prison.\n'A beautiful first win.' That's what everyone at the law firm said about her performance.\nLater, while in prison, the secretary was apparently able to suddenly prove his innocence. Supposedly, it was done with a note written in his own blood. His mother is said to have committed suicide not long after. Proviso had heard many of these alleged events. At the time, she was responsible for helping a high-ranking executive clear himself of bribery charges, and among his many transactions, one of the most frequent recipients was the secretary's superior. She realized at that point that there may have been more to her first case, so she suggested to her mentor that they should get the case retried.\nBut her mentor simply sat behind his desk and looked at her coldly without saying a word.\nShe remembered that when she was still a student filled with admiration, she would head to the courtroom to watch him work. Even though he was the executive defendant's defense attorney, he argued <i>for</i> the staff member plaintiff, and in the end bowed deeply to everyone in the stands. 'Whatever is necessary to uphold justice,' he said at the time.\nProviso said nothing more. She did absolutely everything she could to get the executive's charges thrown out, and earned a huge sum of money.

As the old man slowly made his way to the other side of the bridge, Proviso stretched her ankles and looked around for a place to rest. She quietly said to herself, 'I wonder how much he'll make from that bundle of firewood?'\nProviso said she kept zoning out afterwards. A few days prior, she had just won a case for a certain executive and received a huge sum of money for her services. She knew she had seen plenty of things she shouldn't have while collecting evidence, and her payment was greater than previously agreed on. In other words, she was being paid to keep her mouth shut, and she had assured her discretion. However, after celebrating at a pub, and despite the security features installed in her home, she returned to find a torn business suit hung from the ceiling. She panicked, but also felt a bit relieved, as it meant that was as far as the executive's threat went. At the very least, it was her clothes hanging from the ceiling, not her. She had already experienced similar incidents more than a dozen times, and so when she looked over the rural landscape on the way to Twierdza, all she had on her mind was whether she should purchase a home there to lay low, and how she would have to change the wording in her contracts to keep anyone from finding it.\nProviso paused for a moment, then continued to talk about her journey.\nAs she was zoning out, she paid little attention to the question she had posed on a whim, but after a brief silence, Młynar suddenly gave her a number. Proviso said she was flabbergasted. She could only see his fed up, sorrowful expression after he spoke, and did not understand why he would suddenly answer her question. But after the day's work, she spotted a man in the fields. It was the same old man, having finally traversed the endless rural paths and made it back to his village before dark. He had a small amount of change in his hands, worth roughly the same as the number Młynar gave her.\nShe was holding her terminal in her hand at the time, and just about to answer a phone call from her employer, yet for whatever reason, she did not press the button to pick up the call until the old man had slowly gone back inside his home.

When the civil war broke out, he couldn't see the difference between either side of the conflict, and so he left the country before it devolved into an all-out war, his puzzlement in tow. Ever since, he's lived incognito and has shown little to no interest in the affairs of Kazdel.\nStormeye is primarily in charge of leading a squad on his own to execute field combat operations. He has a particular penchant for the most precarious battlefields.\nHe rarely comments on Rhodes Island's overall expansion plans or its trajectory. More often, he shows up at meetings where an operation's details are being worked out. While many Sarkaz leave an impression on others due to their outstanding Originium Arts, his exceptional combat prowess stems mostly from his own extreme stubbornness in battle, his zealous study of all kinds of combat techniques, and having honed his natural-born detection Arts for years. These skills have become the perfect complement to his combat style.\nStormeye was already infected with Oripathy when he left Kazdel, but given the conditions he was living in at the time, he did not have the luxury of worrying about his illness. Judging from the growth pattern of the Originium crystals, he was likely infected for a second time during combat. During his exile across Terra, he used his might to defend the Infected's right to survive, and gradually became the leader of a small group that possessed considerable combat strength.\nEven while the civil war was in full swing, Babel had already taken notice of this young Sarkaz thanks to the close attention they paid to all the Sarkaz powers that had fled to other parts of Terra. Not long after Rhodes Island was founded, our operators found themselves in a standoff against Stormeye and his militia during an intervention in an Infected-related conflict. After the two sides talked it out, he agreed to join Rhodes Island.\nEven though Stormeye isn't one to bring up his ideals and beliefs, after he joined Rhodes Island he quickly demonstrated through his actions his strong approval for Rhodes Island's. To him, Rhodes Island is the third answer he'd been waiting for in response to the disappointment and bewilderment he'd felt during the civil war. Perhaps what he had been hoping for in that Infected community were allies who truly believed the Infected should live just like anybody else.",

As she progressed with her research, however, she reached a bottleneck.

Thus, she lost her right to join the Spire.\nHaving hit rock bottom, Touch came across Columbian theories of life science, and certain viewpoints in the field provided the perfect confirmation of her research. As such, she headed to Columbia and studied modern medical theory from scratch. Then, with Maylander's sponsorship, she took up research into Oripathy. It was during this time that she met Kal'tsit.\nYears later, Kal'tsit invited Touch to join Babel, but she refused, as she did not want to be involved in political conflicts. After Rhodes Island's foundation, Kal'tsit once again extended her an offer.

He received combat training from his parents since he was little, and later followed them as they emigrated to Sargon. Then, having traveled and worked under multiple padishahs, he finally left Sargon and joined Rhodes Island as one of its first operators when it was established.\nIn his own words: 'My life as a mercenary has been nothing but ordinary.' Indeed, he has no notable achievements from his time in Sargon. That said, if by 'ordinary' he means he fought there for some twenty years, he would have participated in over a hundred battles—both large and small—and made it safely out of every single one. In which case, we would be hard-pressed to find a more formidable soldier in all of Terra.\nFurthermore, when Sharp first came aboard, he had a very clear-cut attitude toward his missions. He never did anything unnecessary, and also clearly avoided coming into contact with other operators. Yet as he began to trust Rhodes Island, and we in turn showed him more of Terra, he started to change his attitude and slowly began to show his true strength in combat.\nRegarding that, Sharp had this to say to Dr. Kal'tsit when he was invited to become an elite operator: 'I gradually realized that Rhodes Island is a company that rewards us for the effort we put in.'\nNaturally, we had long realized that the 'reward' Sharp speaks of refers not to monetary compensation but to some kind of ideal. He had used to hope that his fighting would serve some sort of greater cause, but in the end, reality left him disappointed, and he had no choice but to bury that disappointment by focusing on work. That is, until his arrival here at Rhodes Island.\nAt first, Sharp was clearly derisive of our ideals. He had served many men in Sargon full of empty promises. Besides, our ideal was simply too grandiose. However, we eventually proved through our actions that, no matter how hard this ideal is to achieve, we are slowly making our way toward it. He was finally moved.\nAnd so, Elite Operator Sharp was born.\nBy the time he formally became an elite operator, he had no more reservations about Rhodes Island, and at the same time became less reserved himself. He started to earnestly consult our medics on medical knowledge he'd heard, train with Stormeye all night until daybreak, and even crack jokes during missions. Thanks to this, many operators have come to know him as a warm-hearted man, despite his cold appearance.\nEven today, Sharp describes his missions as 'work.' Yet, owing to how well our elite operators know each other, this itself has become a topic of conversation among his friends. No one loves his work more than Sharp, they say.",

She once hoped to stand out from the crowd with her Originium Arts and mastery of military theory, and thus to contribute to the restoration of Gaul. However, in the end she became infected with Oripathy during a mission and was expelled from the Victorian military.\nUnder her family's influence, Pith was once a committed Gaul restorationist. While she had come to understand the plight of the Sarkaz when she fought alongside Sarkaz mercenaries—and due to the destruction of Gaul very much sympathized with them losing their homeland—it wasn't until she became Infected that she truly understood why the Sarkaz are ostracized. Not only are they a wandering people with nowhere to go, they are also Infected. Having just become Infected herself, Pith had recently lost the social status she'd earned through years of hard work, and felt nothing but hopelessness and anger toward this huge difference in treatment. She joined Babel at the recommendation of her old Sarkaz mercenary friends. Not for any glorious ideals, though. On one hand, she wanted revenge on Victoria. On the other, she wanted to make it clear that she had completely cut ties with her family, leaving her truly without a home.\nDuring her years in Babel, Theresa treated her like a best friend. It made her feel like she had a new family, with new brothers and sisters. It was around this time that her preconceptions about race and ethnicity gradually disappeared. She came to firmly believe that only when all of Terra bands together will the Oripathy problem be solved. Which is why she never left us, even after Babel fell. Instead, she joined Rhodes Island as one of its first operators, to bring that seemingly unrealistic ideal to fruition.\nPith doesn't simply use the same kind of Arts over and over. Thanks to her talent and her studies, she knows the casting methods of almost all of our Caster operators' Arts like the back of her hand. During missions, she casts different combinations of types based on her assessment of the battlefield. At the same time, she makes sure to guide our other Casters' Arts to maximize their lethality.",

She can often be seen at Operator Aciddrop's hallway skateboarding competitions and Operator Vigna's midnight cafeteria rock festivals.

Any mission he participates in will see a markedly increased chance of success, as he organizes tricky mission objectives and breaks them down into clearly structured sub-objectives based on their priority. Following these mission plans often achieves good outcomes for the team. Though some have criticized his methods as being inflexible, this is the best option available to him due to his limited stamina and restricted mobility.\nAfter experiencing the Londinium incident, Totter decided to fully retire, leaving behind his bloodstained past and returning to the uninhabited forests of northern Victoria, living off the land as a hunter. Nowadays, he looks calm and at peace, discussing the happenings in his life in a lighthearted manner. The heavy smoke, smell of rust and disinfectants, and unending screams that once dominated his life have gradually receded, replaced by firewood, hot tea, the smell of pinewood, and the crunching sound of tree branches under his feet.\nHowever, from time to time Totter's straightforward manner of doing things will remind us that the things which have long taken shape within his bones are just waiting for a chance to emerge again.

Under ideal weather conditions, his long-sightedness allows him to easily see targets a hundred meters away, track the target's slightest movements with the naked eye, and make a decisive judgement to take them down.\nThe hunting skills he acquired in his youth became a great foundation on his path to becoming a sniper. He was born in a small, remote rainforest tribe in Sargon, far away from civilization. The hunters in the tribe had passed down their skills from generation to generation, accumulating a wealth of hunting knowledge. Totter's father was also an experienced hunter of the tribe, and passed on their skills of identifying the terrain, predicting the weather, and picking out prey to a young Totter. Totter lived up to the tribe's expectations, quickly picking up those skills and standing out among his peers. Besides that, Totter also possessed a trait that allowed him to become a distinguished hunter—patience. In the hot and humid rainforest, lying dormant and waiting quietly is a nearly impossible task, but Totter was able to rely on his extraordinary patience to lie in wait for an entire day for his prey to come into range. This would also prove to serve him well in his life as a mercenary.\nAfter entering adulthood, he traveled across Sargon, Columbia, and Victoria as a mercenary for hire, venturing into all kinds of places and participating in all sorts of complicated battlefields. To kill his target, he would lie in wait alone for days, deep in the mountains in the harsh winter, or crouch unmoving in the boiling hot sands of the desert under the brilliant sun. Totter never included these extremely boring, difficult, and lonely waits in his reports, merely ending them with a simple 'Mission Complete.'\nTotter is quite particular in his choice of weaponry. His arm strength is good, and the arrows he carries are modified versions of the specialized hunting arrows his tribe used to hunt large targets. These large and powerful arrows have been used multiple times on the battlefield to ease the burden on frontline operators, and their efficacy is obvious.",

He has a room in his cabin used exclusively to store his collection of snow globes, and the crossbow he carries everywhere also has snowflake ornaments on it. He even secretly includes expenses for buying snow globes in the receipts he sends us.\nBased on the exchange records, Totter attributes his love of snow to a snowflake specimen he saw as a young child, left behind by a Victorian merchant caravan passing by the rainforest tribe. Its intricate design led Totter to long for the snowy vistas the merchants described to him, and also evoked his imagination of the lands outside. From then on, Totter changed his mind about staying in the tribe and decided to leave his home after coming of age.\nHowever, that which starts from a single snowflake will inevitably be buried by layers of thick snow.\nAfter leaving his home, Totter met and befriended some close friends, and they formed their own mercenary squad. After taking in many trained combat personnel, the squad gradually took shape and started to gain fame. Just as everything was going swimmingly and everyone was filled with hope, a freak accident caused half the squad to perish. Totter himself was infected with Oripathy in the incident, and lost almost all his mobility. Unable to keep up with the others, he was left behind deep in a forest. Being close to the Snow Realm, that forest was often hit by sudden blizzards, turning what was once a sunny day into one full of heavy hail and frost.\nTotter once admitted that he fell into a deep depression for a long time after leaving the mercenary squad, until one day when he was lying drowsily in bed due to the effects of his pain medication. The howling wind of the blizzard outside had gradually died down, leaving the area in silence as a single beam of sunlight shone on his closed eyelids, waking him from his nightmares. As he glanced towards the window, on the pure white forest floor outside stretching into the horizon he saw several thin and leafless fir trees stabbing viciously into the cloudless blue sky. Miraculously, Totter felt nothing but peace from this sight. He no longer felt pain and sorrow from being left behind, and was finally able to accept and feel relief towards the misfortunes that had befallen him.\nHowever, during that conversation, I noticed Totter kept his eyes on the floor, and licked his lips several times. It was obvious that he was hiding something. Despite my questioning, he stubbornly refused to reveal anything to me, and even began to avoid conversing with me.\nTotter's behavior worries me. Perhaps he buried more than pain and despair within that snow. I couldn't help but come to a horrifying thought. Did he really manage to walk out of that flawless snowfield, that bitterly cold winter?",

A kid like her should never have been fighting a war in Londinium—Most operators who've met her share this opinion.\nAnd that is indeed the case.\nWhile working with her mercenary team in Columbia, Paprika took on only minor duties such as serving as a bodyguard or slaying wild beasts. When her team leader, Grimm, heeded Theresis's call and told everyone they were heading to Londinium, she did not even understand what this new contract entailed.\nTrusting in her captain, the Sarkaz girl ignorantly marched into Londinium and followed the orders of the higher-ups.

Thus, she was raised by her grandmother in a small town in Columbia.\nThe town was several hours away by car from the nearest nomadic city, and a large number of Pioneers and Infected gathered in the area. Although life was hardly luxurious, she nonetheless enjoyed a happy, stable childhood thanks to the hand-knitted items her grandmother sold for a living.\nLike most Sarkaz, Paprika became infected with Oripathy at a young age. According to her, on her tenth birthday she woke up, rubbed her eyes, and stood in front of her chipped mirror to find a small rock having emerged from her chest.\nShe immediately understood that she was already Infected.\nThe Sarkaz girl's condition was fairly stable most of the time, and she's had no critical flare-ups. To the Sarkaz, Oripathy infection is almost a foregone conclusion, so becoming Infected is hardly a major disruption to their lives. When a company, facility, or city already rejects the Sarkaz, it doesn't matter to them whether the one they're refusing entry to is also infected or not.\nAfter her infection was confirmed, Paprika's path to adulthood became more or less set in stone:\nHer grades at school were only average, so she had no opportunity to continue her education. The school she was enrolled in encouraged her to drop out, and no other would accept her.\nUnable to attend school anymore, she at first helped her grandmother with her knitting business. Then she followed the local Pioneers and started slaying wild beasts out in the barrenlands for money. In the process, she came into contact with a team of Sarkaz mercenaries, and after spending some time with them chose to join them as well.\nAfter all, other than becoming a mercenary, what choice did a Sarkaz like her have?",

Why did so many Sarkaz participate in the war when they didn't even have a reason to fight? Why did they have to choose to either kill or be killed on the battlefield?\nAre death and parting really so common to mercenaries that there's nothing to be so sad about, like what Old Grimm told her?\nPaprika still hasn't found concrete answers to many of her questions.\nHowever, every time she stares down at the old cigarette box in her hands, she thinks back to that night in the Columbian wilderness, when the mercenary team had set up a tent and a campfire. Old Grimm sat next to the fire. The exposed areas of the old Sarkaz man's body were covered in scars, and every time his lips twitched, the look on his face would scare the pants off any normal folks in the vicinity. Nonetheless, he would always give the freshest roasted jerky to the team's youngest girl, and downplayed it like he wasn't taking care of the youngsters.\nWhen he talked about the good life awaiting the Sarkaz just around the corner, even the scars on his old face stretched as he grinned.\nSadly, luck wasn't on Old Grimm's side. Soon enough, he gave his life in Victoria. When she was detained by Manfred, Paprika held onto the cigarette box she got from the old man and tried her hardest to imagine the good life that he looked forward to so much.\nWhat would that life be like? Would they never catch Oripathy again? Or would they get to pay less money each year and not be rejected for 'insufficient qualifications' when applying for school or work, simply because they're Sarkaz?\n'I used to think being a mercenary was great. We put our skills to use to make a living.'\nThat's what Operator Paprika told our other mercenary operators.\n'But they said I wasn't a full-fledged mercenary. They told me I hadn't even killed.\n'Then I finally figured it out and made sure of it.\n'It doesn't matter what grand objectives Manfred and the men above him have, at the very least, following a bastard like him and becoming a 'full-fledged mercenary' who kills without blinking an eye is not the kind of life I want to live!'",

After waking up on the second day, while passing from the dormitory to the cafeteria, and then through three floors on the way to the workshop, he greeted no less than 15 operators hailing from all over Terra. Not only did he remember everyone's names correctly, he even used the little-known real names of a few of them.\nThe combat records show that during the special operation in Londinium, he was the first Self-Salvation Corps member to extend a hand of friendship to Rhodes Island. This was obviously due to his personality. An Engineering operator who quickly befriended him revealed that Stainless does not employ any particular social technique. 'Well, it's just that when someone looks at you so sincerely and enthusiastically, and takes the initiative to talk to you, you can't help but go along with it and treat him as an old friend.' So says the relatively introverted operator.\nThough lively and cheerful, Stainless does not carelessly ignore other people's feelings and try to force his friendship on them. On the contrary, he is always sensitive towards his friends' emotional states. Many operators often receive little handmade gifts from him when feeling down, and these intricate trinkets inevitably bring a smile to their face.\n'My popularity within the department has been in a freefall ever since Feist arrived!' Closure complained aloud. 'I always suspected him of trying to poach my subordinates, but luckily we managed to get him on our side first...

              "storyText": "When working, Stainless's hands are very steady, far moreso than you'd expect from someone in their early twenties.\nBefore joining the Londinium Citizens' Self-Salvation Corps, he worked for nearly a decade in the Londinium military factories. Moreover, before he officially became a worker, he was an apprentice for seven or eight years.\nIt can be said that he was an artificer from the moment he could pick up a drill and a spanner.\nVictoria's machinery industry is extremely advanced, and Londinium's military factories are at the cutting edge of its technological prowess. Each of these factories is close to the size of a small neighborhood, with neatly segregated zones and criss-crossed with automated assembly lines and piping that form a self-contained transportation network. Conveyer belts connect these factories both internally and externally, ensuring a highly efficient flow of raw materials and intermediate products, while mechanical arms large and small handle the majority of the streamlined grunt work. As for the workers who move about these large machines, their role is to maintain this mechanized assembly system, performing repairs and system updates as needed. Despite being just an ordinary worker, Stainless's knowledge of engineering theory is on par with a Columbian graduate in mechanical engineering. Moreover, he also has strong practical skills. No matter how precise a machine is, there are always some manufacturing processes that require fine observation and adaptability, thus requiring the hands and attention of a skilled craftsman.\nThis style of work is quite different from what the engineering operators of Rhodes Island are accustomed to. Including Closure, our engineers rely much more on individual creativity to complete their work. Based on the work habits of each team, the workshop is also divided into multiple smaller areas. This means that Rhodes Island rarely produces standardized 'official' equipment. Even a weapon specially created for the same operator may change drastically between each maintenance.\nRegardless, Stainless was able to quickly settle into his role as a Rhodes Island engineer. On one hand, he used his knowledge of automation to make Closure a series of proposals that greatly enhanced the efficiency of Rhodes Island's landship maintenance protocols. On the other hand, he has excitedly exchanged ideas with every engineer in Rhodes Island, coming up with all kinds of new ideas and rapidly implementing them. The operation platform he designed and manufactured has already reached its 13th iteration, while Rockrock's drones are also being quickly upgraded. He even borrowed the technology Closure uses to modify Lancet-2 and other operation platforms to enhance his own platform, installing a screen on it to express emotions and improve its developing smart dialogue capabilities.\n'Those overly advanced automation technologies in Londinium ended up holding back his potential.' Mechanist notes. 'But the solid training he's received will become a strong foundation for his overly active imagination.'",

Unlike the spacious factory interiors, everything outside is tightly packed. The overground rail stations pass right through buildings, while the fruit stalls are right next to the garbage disposal. A layer of black grime covers the walls and streets, which not even the heavy rains of Londinium can wash away.\nThe residents of Highbury are primarily local workers. They spend most of their time in the factories every day, and take the railway back to their dormitories after work. They repeat this busy schedule daily, working to hold up the city famous for its industry, yet most of them have never even seen what the other boroughs of Londinium look like. Due to the city council's planning, the tall dormitories around the outer edge form a singular wall, preventing the rust-laden air from wafting towards other boroughs, while also preventing the workers from seeing past it. They know nothing of the museums and opera houses of the Auchterigg Borough, nor the villas and gardens of the Magna Borough.\nStainless's descriptions of Highbury also reveal another aspect to it.\n'You must have eaten fried fin and potato pies in Victoria, right? Highbury has the best fried fin and potato pie stalls in the whole of Londinium. The stall owners I know all work fast and don't skimp on ingredients. It's what you have to do to survive running a food stall in Highbury. \n'There's also the taverns. We always head to the taverns after work every Friday. You never need to worry about getting home after drinking too much, since everyone around you is a friend.'\n'I also like the lifts in the dormitories! Haha, they were built from scrap materials by the workers living there, and can get you from the top floors to the underground transportation pipelines in no time at all. I used to climb up and down them when I was a kid, and it always ended with me getting spanked by my granny...'\nWhen the Sarkaz entered Highbury, they did almost no damage to the factories. To an outsider, the busy and crowded Highbury may have looked no different from how it always had. However, Stainless knew well that his cherished life had already disappeared. Many food stalls had shuttered, Sarkaz mercenaries patrolled the roads from the factories to the taverns, and even his beloved lifts had been destroyed by the Defense Forces for being a security risk.\nAs Stainless put it, the reason he left Highbury to join the Londinium Citizens' Self-Salvation Corps was for 'Home and Liberty.' That simple joy in his memories is what kept him going through battle after battle.",

Their organization is loose, and there is no clear manifesto. What is their ultimate goal? To save people from the Sarkaz, or to defeat the Sarkaz? What if they're able to beat the Sarkaz? What will their next step be? Would they find out that the Sarkaz are not the sole source of suffering for the Londiniers?\nThat group of youngsters may call themselves warriors, but they have never experienced war.\nI've seen many wars like this.\nWar brings pain. Weapons and shells, they're nothing but flesh wounds. The self-doubt and remorse of watching your friends and family sacrifice themselves while you remain helpless is far worse. And well, the worst pains don't even come from your enemies.\nFeist trusts others easily, especially those he calls friends. He believes that everyone is just like him, willing to stand up and resist a common foe, all for the sake of protecting each other and pursuing a better future.\nHe does not understand... It's instinctual to wish for a better life, but that's not the same as being willing to fight for one.\nHe will surely experience betrayal in the future. It will leave an indelible scar upon his heart.\nAt the end of this war, will youngsters like him still be able to trust others so easily, and carry such a pure hope towards life?\nBefore, I didn't think so.\nNow... Heh, I must admit, that young'un is stronger than I gave him credit for. I see in him the courage to face these problems.\n\n——Excerpt from a conversation between an old worker and the Doctor during the Londinium incident",

I dreamt that I secretly installed Rhodes Island's motors and tracks onto our factory, and it started moving by itself. It moved faster than high-speed ships, and even started to fly after a while, going higher and higher until it reached a completely dark place. There were no Sarkaz around, and no armies or anything either. I didn't want to stop, so our factory just kept flying on. There was obviously nothing in front of us, but it still felt so vast to me... Ugh, isn't that such a silly dream? It's not? Weird, in my dream, you were sitting next to me at the top of the factory, just like now. And when I told you about wanting to keep flying ahead, you also told me that it wasn't silly.'",

In these times, the Metal Crabs will reciprocate with an equal love and care for their breeder, not letting her suffer so much as a nick of harm.",
