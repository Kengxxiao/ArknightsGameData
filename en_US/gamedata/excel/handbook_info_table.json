The current, most reliable information comes from Silence's own writings about her experiences as well as other aspects of her life. \nAccording to her recollection, Silence's relationship with Rhine Lab and Originium began during her days as a student, when she accompanied her mentor to the company. \nAt that time, Rhine Lab was holding a scientific exhibition to show off the results of its research from a tour of Columbia. The new medical equipment she saw optimized Originium transmission efficiency based upon new results obtained from live trials, making possible a whole new generation of dazzling treatments. \nAfter completing her studies, Silence's wish came true and she was allowed to join Rhine Lab as an employee. She had an extraordinary talent for Originium Arts, and soon got the opportunity to participate in several experimental projects related to important Originium technology and clinical treatment. \nBut as well as her career was going, and as much as the upper levels of the company recognized her achievements, Silence never forgot her original dream - to join the Originium Technology and Life Science Applications project. \n\n\"I never thought the opportunity would come so soon.\" \nLooking back on this time, Silence let slip a sly smile.",

It was not fitted with a weapon, instead its only designated function was to provide timely treatment for Operators on the battlefield. \nMedicine that has undergone several rounds of testing by the Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Team can be assembled into the drone's kits in a variety of ways. The drone can use aerosolized medicine, it can spray, it can inject, and it can simulate a medic's treatment wand. It can switch between these modes depending on the needs of the terrain and the environment, and the specific situation of the Operator in need of healing. \nHowever, this medical drone is still in its experimental stages. Because it needs to be lightweight and convenient, it needs to be a kind of throwaway and relatively fragile low-value target. Additionally, in areas with strong signal interference and complex terrain, its efficiency will be affected to a certain degree. \nEven so, it still provides Rhodes Island Operators with quality treatment. Better still, this is only the first gift that Silence has brought to Rhodes Island.",

Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment was unsuccessful.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more demanding patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at the other company. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overconfident most of the time, even bordering on egotistical. She is extremely impulsive, ready to act the second an idea pops into her mind, no matter how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, the outstanding form her Originium Arts take must be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement her talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in her emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, her instincts push her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way. As a result, even if she never intended to do so, she has saved many lives.",

However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from typical Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains particular talent for Originium Arts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have proven an unexpected obstacle to the medical team's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic nerve pain and even occasional hallucinations. Records describe these hallucinations as enormous apparitions that are tremendously painful for her, or depictions of charred corpses and immolated animals, or close personal relations consumed by a sea of agonizing fire. The causes of these apparitions have proven elusive to all medical and mechanical analyses. It is possible that this ongoing torment is the source of her irascible character. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even by Rhodes Island standards. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Classified Log]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite peculiar. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure...

This has meant that the people of Kjerag have not needed to rely on nomadic cities to live and work. Of course, the steep terrain has also slowed Kjerag's development considerably. \nThe name of the Karlan Trade Company is probably derived from the name of the holy mountain the believers of Kjerag worship. \nThe trade company, run by SilverAsh, is the only window to the outside world for the insular and conservative nation of Kjerag. At the same time, this company has unavoidably changed the country. \nIt would be wise for Rhodes Island to research SilverAsh's record, given this level of power and vision.",

LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island. \nWhatever the case, the other Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled. \nSilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them. \nWhether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with political conspiracy and such machinations are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself, as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \n Dr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh.

Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. Perhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nThereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nNow according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament. \nIn what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

The conflict between the Kjerag conservative faction and the reformist party have gotten more and more intense.\nOn the surface, the Karlan Trade Company is only concerned with foreign trade. However, its true owner is none other than Enciodes Silverash, head of the Silverash Family and opponent of the two conservative houses in the country's parliament.\nYou may also know him as SilverAsh, brother of Rhodes Island Operator Cliffheart.\nI am convinced that the Karlan Trade Company doesn't pay a cent to the government of Kjerag. It isn't a state-owned enterprise! Its operations and business are controlled entirely by SilverAsh himself!\nModern military equipment has passed from Raythean's hands, through the Karlan Trade Company's channels, and into Kjerag. The conservative faction doesn't even have any means of tracing the whereabouts of the goods.\nThe trade route has already been moved to the foot of the holy mountain, Karlan. The Vine-Bear Court has already used SilverAsh's sister, Saint Pramanix, as leverage to try to get the Silverash family to leave the Three House Parliament and hand over control of the valley and mining sites.\nThe troops the Karlan Trade Company sent to the training camps have already returned from Ascarat County in Victoria. Where are they now? The conservative Kjerag guards don't have any idea.\nSo what does Kjerag need most right now? We are reaching a boiling point here.

Just the tiniest little push...\nThe avalanche will bury all of Kjerag, including all of its conspiracies and all of the matters of the past.\n\nI admit that perhaps the Karlan Trade Company isn't hiding anything dangerous.\nEven so, should we really put ourselves in danger just because Cliffheart received a secret letter?\nAt the very least, Rhodes Island as a whole should not assume this magnitude of risk.\n\n--Dobermann, at the meeting 12 days before the incident at the mountain.",

It is very easy to overlook her light gear and weapons, leading to a gross underestimation of her combat prowess. \nOn the other hand, the close-up melee style she prefers also can put her in peril.

Her parents worked at William University, her father a graduate professor for the School of Originium, her mother an environmental and ecological research specialist. The couple died in a volcanic eruption during a survey. \nEyjafjalla's parents had begun a project to study natural Catastrophes on Terra, and the volcano was a key site. Among the files Eyjafjalla took with her to Rhodes Island, she treasured the report on that volcano most of all. She didn't want the study to end with the passing of her parents, so she decided to continue it in their stead. \nVolcanic research must be done on-site before eruption and required long-term close-range observation. Particles with Originium components tended to be common in volcanic areas, and cooling lava constantly turned over new Originium veins, making the region a breeding ground for Oripathy. This is believed to be the reason for Eyjafjalla's infection.",

By further analyzing these data, Deepcolor can summarize her subjects' private information that most intelligence operatives would need long periods of observation to acquire, such as lifestyle choices and daily habits. \nAccording to Deepcolor's personal account, this is nothing but a basic skill possessed by all painters, and she is still at the shoal of the sea of art.\nNote 1: The sea she describes and the \"Deep\" in her code name are strange concepts for some Operators. Please see it as \"boundless water.\"\nNote 2: After rejecting Deepcolor's request to paint a portrait of the creator of this file, the profiler still received a sketch from her.",

Her combat style isn't exactly orthodox--air-painting is not a known Artcasting method, nor is it easy to comprehend. \nFurthermore, perhaps most difficult to understand are the creatures she commands, dubbed \"helpers\" (or \"tentacles\" by nosy Operators). The reason these long, thin threads are called \"creatures\" is because they possess the intelligence and mobility of a pet trained to follow orders, greatly adding to Deepcolor's combat flexibility. After comparisons to the \"Meeboos\" created by Mayer of the Rijn Life Research Center, these creatures are actually mechanical entities defying any existing classification. They have spindly bodies without noses, mouths, or ears. \nAccording to Deepcolor's own reports, these creatures were captured by her father somewhere in faraway Sargon as a gift to her. She summed up the \"helpers\" as merely \"as yet unclassified creatures.\"",

Most of the lances were left to collect dust in the storehouse. Even though Vigna had enough cash for a better weapon, she saw the lance in the corner and right off the bat knew she had to have it. \nWielding the lance requires great strength and skill, so Vigna doubled her daily training regimen. And to improve the power of the lance, she contacted the original manufacturer and custom-ordered a new model in pursuit of the perfect build. \nAfter her modifications, her lance is now a light, keen, durable, and powerful weapon. Vigna herself has also stepped up her own personal combat training in order to improve her mastery over the unique tool. \nVigna has never felt she could or would ever quit.

That earned her a personal invite from Wei Yenwu, Chief Executive of Lungmen, as well as headlines in all the newspapers. \nWith Wei's and the L.G.D's support, Shaw was accepted into Rhodes Island for her expertise in fire safety and prevention. It was an obvious boon to the island, since most Operators have little to no knowledge of or training in firefighting. Shaw handily filled the gap. \nWhen Shaw had the chance to inspect the intricate passageways and firefighting equipment on the island, and after meeting certain Operators who wield fire Arts at will, she realized she faced a daunting task.",

The first seminar commenced with the notable absence of Dr. Kal'tsit, where Shaw presented materials and slides (including various scenes of major fires and warning signs). The presentation was short, thanks to Shaw's famously fast rate of speech, and the raucous applause made it clear the audience had no clue what she had intended to communicate to them.

The complex terrain wrought havoc with their communications signals. \nWhen the squad finally found Grani, she had ran the bandits off on her own. \nShe took the initiative when fellow Operators could not arrive before the raiders began looting a village. She devised a plan to buy time, using the town streets and houses to mitigate the attack. She eventually forced the bandits to give up. \nHowever, when she went to rescue a child kidnapped by an outlaw, she took a hit to her left arm. \nAfter returning to Rhodes Island, the Operators discussed her course of action: \"She continued pursuing the enemy, but did she violate the directives of the operation?\" \nThey came to the conclusion that while she did break some rules, without her efforts, the mission would have failed. \nGrani made the right call.",

It's beside the point, but that team was the prototype for the Guard Department's Special Inspection Unit. There were a lot of tabloids and novels written about them. \nAnyway, they pulled it off. The ringleader was executed and most of his accomplices were killed on the spot. \nThe hostage? She was just a little girl. The kidnappers clearly didn't think about how traumatic the experience would be for her. \nShe didn't end up seeing anything gruesome. She saw a Lungmen police officer rushing out. She saw the heavy Christmas snowfall. She saw the street lamps and the Christmas tree outside the abandoned building.

School, and no one questions her ability, dedication, or hatred of her enemies. Police officers working with Ch'en often complained about her demeanor--too strict and too harsh. Everyone thought that this harsh character would disappear in the struggle for power, and she would soften up after being worn down by endless incidents. \nSurprisingly, both crime and casualty rates have declined in the past two years, and the younger generation of officers began being promoted faster and more substantively. Ch'en was promoted and joined one of the most important teams in the Department, the Special Inspection Unit. \nMembers of this unit are generally not allowed to serve more than two years - to protect their lives and reduce their stress. Perhaps this position isn't suitable to serve for a long time: old inspectors' careers always seem to end with heroic sacrifice. \nCh'en did not retreat. She doesn't even know how to back down. \nShe became the fastest promoted officer in the history of the Lungmen police force, and also the youngest Special Inspector in the Department. Those who ridiculed her were impressed by her perseverance. After all, planning for the future is one thing. Planning every day is another. \nWhy was she so hard? Why live life this way?

During the course of treatment, Astesia took her sister's advice to join Rhodes Island.\nAstesia is quite skilled with a sword. Her family has passed down a form of ceremonial swordplay: a ritual in which one hand holds a celestial orb, while the other holds an originium sword.

As far as we know, the connection between astrology and originium Arts is very weak, despite most illustrious astrologers in recent years all agreeing with a level of certainty on a close link between the expression of originium Arts and the celestial bodies. At this point we still have no evidence to support a direct or indirect connection, but we speculate that the emergence of these originium Arts that appear to be linked to the celestial bodies will further convince the common people of these beliefs. Were it not for these techniques, most people would likely return to the scientific explanations for originium Arts, turning away from astrology.\nBack to Astesia, she has reported that she feels her own abilities are weakening. Our observations show that contracting Oripathy has had an effect on the originium Arts she already possessed. These effects will persist for quite some time, but we cannot say what the outcome will be, and whether it will be good or bad for Astesia. We need more time for observation and research.

On the contrary, her passion for technology seems to come from the exoskeletal equipment designed to help her overcome these hardships.\nSomething worth mentioning is that Glaucus was born with antibodies that fight against irritants and poisons. Apart from conventional poisons, nerve paralyzers and hallucinogens are essentially ineffective. Glaucus is eager to accompany the medics' research.

Independent city-states, however, are.\nIt should be said that in the context of the present day, the social collectives referred to by \"nation\" were city-states in the past. The predecessors of several nations were independent cities gathered together. Additionally, even today, some nomadic cities that nominally belong to certain nations still to varying degrees retain the customs and traditions of the city as opposed to those of the nation.\nHowever, it must be conceded that the concept of an independent city is falling by the wayside, although the old-fashioned and elderly might refuse to admit it. That is because the concept of a nation is more powerful.\nNow, even though there is still a considerable number of independent cities on Terra, their leaders have already recognized that independent cities are no match for nations. In recent years, there have been many such independent cities that have surrendered to neighboring nations.\nHowever, Siesta's special characteristics may be able to take them in a new direction.",

In fact, the discipline of Originium Research has a large number of sub-categories, both in the applied area of the doctrine as well as the theoretical. Ceylon specializes in researching the history of applied development of Originium. \nBefore the modern academics managed to specialize the research, many precious historical materials on Originium were not well preserved. In fact, collecting clues from past historical data to infer the paths of development of the various Originium schools was also an important part of modern Originium research.\nAlthough today, with the development of science and technology, the study of historical materials has gradually become less concerned with the development of theory and more the verification of it. Of course, the importance of recording history itself is self-evident for the meaning of a civilization.\nNaturally, although Ceylon has only just graduated from university, her intellectual reserves and enthusiasm for the study of Originium is breath-taking, and one can clearly see how much effort Ceylon put into her studies. For Rhodes Island, the addition of such an outstanding talent is a most unexpected surprise.",

However, these methods often come at considerable cost to herself.\nPerhaps Schwarz does not have as much experience in dealing with monsters as other operators do, but she is uniquely capable among Rhodes Island operators at dealing with human and humanoid foes. In the words of one operator, \"She is like a machine designed specifically to ruthlessly kill humans.\"\nHowever, in the presence of Ceylon, she may still be cold, but she betrays a softer side. Her relationship with Ceylon is less a simple master-servant relationship, and more of a relationship between sisters on equal-footing. She dotes heavily upon her younger sister and will satisfy any of her requests, no matter how unreasonable. She shows tolerance even for her most whimsical notions, and her normally cold voice possesses a certain pampering tone.\nIt is only in these moments that she appears to transform from a machine to a person, in the eyes of spectators.

However, during the event, she chose to stand on the other side. Though she was forgiven, this has still ultimately been taken as a betrayal, and has caused a chain reaction of events.\nIn the analysis of the incident, we can see that the real reason she took the other side was because that she has an inclination toward the city's Mayor, Herman. It is true that she deeply loves Ceylon, but she is not just her puppet. Theoretically, as the mayor's agent, she ought to be the one who understands him the most. Her quote, \"When it's time to shed blood, do not send Lady Ceylon to do it, send someone who lives amongst the shadows,\" is likely an accurate representation of her mentality on this.\nDespite bearing witness to the event, after joining Rhodes Island, Ceylon has still shown some idealistic tendencies. This is normal. She witnessed some of the cruelty that this world is capable of, but the relatively neat resolution to this incident has lightened some of the shock of it. Moreover, not everyone needs to have a deep understanding of this so-called cruel reality.\nHowever, this brings us to the salient point of this discussion: What position should Rhodes Island take on this issue?\nPeople like Ceylon are not a minority in Rhodes Island. Rhodes Island is not purely a research institution and thus our nature determines that we will sometimes come face-to-face with unsavory situations. Do we have an obligation or necessity to expose these members to cruelties they've never experienced before? Or is it enough to abide by Schwarz's quote and \"Send someone who lives amongst the shadows?\"\nThis is a topic worth discussing in more detail.\n——Archivist R.F.",

Actually, aside from giving you a detailed description of the bushes and shrubs I hid in, there isn't much I can tell you. Wait, and then attack - it really is that simple.\nI was born into a family of Rim Billiton merchants. Both of my parents were traders. When I was six years old, they were involved in a deal in which they were tricked into collecting a number of Originium Stones disguised as ordinary gems. I was infected with Oripathy when I stole some of these stones to play with them.\nAfter my parents found out, they went to confront those who had tricked them, but were ambushed and killed en route. I was treated like a slave and sold. In the end, I was selected by a mercenary unit to become their newest member.\nIn addition to carrying out war operations, this mercenary unit was also responsible for carrying out tasks for important men, mostly their dirty work. After I passed their training, I became a child assassin. After several missions, my organization was tasked with staging some accidents\" in a certain city.\nThat is where my fate changed.\nMy task was to assassinate Lady Ceylon's father, but in the process of getting close to him, he subdued me. You can't even imagine. He was a... Forget it, I won't even bring it up. In short, I helped him eliminate my entire mercenary unit. Afterward, I became part-housekeeper, part-bodyguard. That year, Lady Ceylon was three years old, and I was 12.\nActually, what Lady Ceylon doesn't know is that during those years I was a bodyguard, I also helped her father with other matters... Don't get me wrong, I was willing to. The person I care about most is Lady Ceylon but the person I respect the most was her father. That still hasn't changed after all this time.\n......That day, he called me back to Siesta and told me that he found my enemies. Before I set out, he asked me \"Are you sure you want to go? You can live a good life here, Schwarz.\" Ultimately, I went, but not just for revenge, but also to make a clean break. Also, I knew that somebody was waiting for me.\"\n——This story was related by the Doctor personally.

Part of this hatred is derived from his desire to protect the clinic, and the other part is due to reasons unknown.\nThough Hellagur is by no means a defeatist, he still has taken a hardline attitude toward operations in the Ursus area.\nHowever, when analyzing the military power of Ursus, he has said \"No political entity should come into direct conflict with Ursus. Even if its corruption and fanaticism will eventually destroy it, it's still the most fearsome force in the land.\"\nFrom this point of view it could be said that as an infected himself, Hellagur's opinions on many matters are far more critical than those of other infected.\nAll strategically-minded operators have their own thoughts on the situation, and they're all well aware of Rhodes Island's true circumstances in it. Hellagur's relationship with Ursus may make a small number of operators distrustful. But operators who attended the strategic meetings all understand Hellagur's true intentions.\n\nBut Hellagur's words contain no contradictions. He believes that as an infected, he is already on Ursus's opposing side -- \n\n\"However, once Ursus looks at you, you will know the difference between being an enemy of Ursus, and Ursus regarding you as one.\"",

His friend was the commander of the enemy army, the target of his mission, and was identified as a core figure in the enemy army by Ursus. \nThe second trauma was when a terrible battle broke out between him and the person he trusted the most. After the battle, he was still standing, but the fate of the other person is unknown, as if he died in some unknown alley somewhere.\n\nThe first time, his friend entrusted him with a blade called \"Kudarikiri,\" and a young infected girl named Neon.\nThe second time, the person he trusted left him a black market clinic called \"Azazel,\" as well as a conviction.\n\nHellagur knew his friend had plotted Ursus's defeat, but Hellagur would not blame him.\nHellagur knew that the child he trusted had instigated the entire betrayal and injured all of the infected in the clinic, but Hellagur would not hate this child.\n\nHe often refers to himself as a warrior. Perhaps this is because he doesn't know how to face everything Ursus has done to him.\nMaybe a little bit of hope is the only motivation he has to keep on living.\"\n\nAlthough these conclusions unavoidably contain some of the opinions of the individual who collected this intelligence, we still trust in her ability to organize clues.\nOur response to the incident depends on the decision itself, but at the very least, we may already understand the reason why the General often merely sighs at Miss Neon's improper behavior.",

He earned a major reputation during the Tenth Urcha War. An Ursus soldier with these kinds of achievements is rare indeed.\nDuring the Bloodpeak Campaign, he established a glowing military record but then vanished without a trace. There is only one high-ranking Ursus commander that meets these conditions.\nAs for how I made the inference, well, it's just a guess! Over several decades, Ursus has executed over a hundred commanders. The few left alive can be counted on one hand. Consult a registry of names to get the answer!\nIn the past, both Kal'tsit and I would have been opposed to this cooperation. But these are different times. Even■■■■feels that the situation is getting quite thorny.\nKal'tsit believes that after the Chernobog Incident, the Ursus authorities will carry out a frantic counter-attack and that this should be handled through the Ursus infected community.\nMy thinking is a bit simpler. Azazel is buried so deeply that if Rhodes Island dug them out, Ursus wouldn't have much of an opinion on it. Anyway, they're not too familiar with them.\nThe more cards we have to play, the better, and it's not about who plays their cards first. Warfarin also really wants to get her hands on Azazel's technology. Just look at it as me trying to do someone a favor, all right?\nHowever, the Doctor absolutely refuses to let me see Hellagur's writings! Damn it. What's wrong with taking a peek? I'm not going to forget this!\n\nBut what exactly is the General thinking about? Or who exactly is still supporting him?\nSince the Bloodpeak Campaign, the nobility and the new politicians have been using this opportunity to eliminate military forces. Hellagur has been very lucky to survive judgment. Of course, this may be the benefit of his never having participated in politics, but think about this: neither the army nor the politicians will be content with the current situation. They'll both have the next step planned.\nHe'll never divulge much about Azazel. Maybe its secrets are as terrifying as his experiences. Kal'tsit knows that Hellagur isn't Azazel's main leader.\nThis isn't over. His experience, his country, the things he cares about will all drag him down eventually. When the time comes, it may not be up to us whether we can lend him a hand or not.\n——■■■",

She trained the kids, with great frustration, and they in turn changed her disposition. In time, she grew to accept the soldiers as her own.

She put her heart and soul into her men, right up until the point when the brass decided to send them on a suicide mission. Dur-nar was beside herself. She flew into a rage and assaulted a suprior officer. She has been unwilling to discuss the events that followed. According to certain documents we've acquired, she was forcibly discharged. She then went through a period of hopping from security to police to mercenary work for short stints, up until she arrived at Rhodes Island. When the Doctor asked her in private why she had come to join Rhodes Island, she produced a letter. It was a letter of thanks from the few survivors of her squad of trainees. At the end of the letter, the Doctor fixated on a particular sentence, \"If there were a place where the command actually cared about the grunts, would you give it a try?\" After that was an address to send her resume to Rhodes Island, along with all the names of the survivors.\n\n\"And that's why I'm here.\"",

That is, until they are discovered, and they make a break for it, barely escaping, dripping with sweat, struggling to breathe. \nEthan was one of them. He couldn't fight, and he couldn't talk trash. His spraypaint was his only voice, its vibrant colors and striking characters screaming out the plight of the Infected for all to see and hear. And with his nigh-invisibility, getting away from those who would stop him was trivial. \nThe city's dark nights had become chaotic and unpredictable. \nBut Ethan didn't care. All he had to do was run away. He could even help the other Savras get away. No one was as good at escaping as them.

The political entities founded on deeply held beliefs go beyond Laterano alone, and the uniqueness of their citizenry cannot be attributed to piety or self-discipline alone. \nThis is also not to say that executors, including Executor, are not themselves strong. Last week, I saw him tear out the aorta of a vicious beast with his bare hands, spraying his partner with blood. That was not the first time an operator came crying to me that \"Executor is terrifying,\" and it certainly won't be the last. \nBut for the hands of its few lawyers, executors, wandering judges, and the Pope himself, Laterano can do little more than proclaim that the law must be followed. \nIn addition to its temporal statutes, Laterano must have another, higher order of law that we cannot perceive. Rather than saying the executor is one piece of the Laterano legal apparatus, it would be more appropriate to say that the executor is the physical manifestation that Laterano created to befit the name of the law. At least that's my opinion. \n\nAll I want to know is what Executor meant by \"the statute that takes effect once a shot is fired\".

But found herself seriously injured and knocked unconscious by a wild beast. Fortunately, she was rescued by an elderly hunter passing by. In order to save her life, she had no choice but to give up her wounded arm. When Vermeil awakened and realized the position she was in, she devoted herself to a quick recovery. She overcame her pain, and rapidly adapted to the use of her prosthetic. \nVermeil continued to hunt her goal, down the path of revenge. The only one she spared was an elderly mercenary, long since retired, surrounded by children and grandchildren. She took only his left arm and a medal symbolizing his honor as a mercenary, sparing his life. At this point, Vermeil has suspended her retaliation against the Ursus.",

At first, her only knowledge of the disease came from certain individuals who had contact with the Infected, the veracity of their statements hard to determine. She decided to endure this intractable disease just as she endured the pain from losing her arm.\nThe number of people suffering from Oripathy increase by the day, and talk about the Infected spreads to more and more people as well. It was only from this that Vermeil realized, the Infected were no longer seen in the same light. All kinds of rumors about Oripathy were spread around. Suspicion festered into ostracizing or even persecution, but Vermeil lost the ability to make further judgments about the situation. All she knew was that her pain was real.\nHowever, Vermeil does not bear any resentment towards her Oripathy - she merely sees it as an inevitable part of life. Even though she became Infected and was persecuted because of it, she did not come to hate anyone for it. If she met someone who did hate her, she would just stare back fiercely.\nIf there’s a way to find a cure, then go to receive treatment. If not, then carry on until you can't move anymore. Just like when she accepted the loss of her arm, Vermeil also accepted her identity as an Infected.",

Unexpectedly, according to several different sources, the prosthetic was the work of a Laterano mechanic who saved Vermeil in the mountains of Siracusa whose name appeared on a prepaid check covering Vermeil’s medical expenses. Vermeil always seemed to have little to say about the benefactor who saved her life, but from her attitude towards her past, she appears to hold a deep respect for him. \nSince she does not seem to want to talk about these experiences, it may be better to let this story remain buried deep within her heart.",

This past month has been stellar, and I think we've all earned a nice meal. On me, as always! \nNow then, I have something to discuss, pertaining to the exchange agreement between Lungmen and Rhodes Island. The first round of applicant review falls on us. We do very important work here! \nEven those of you most familiar with Rhodes Island's regulations will sometimes get confused by some wording or something, right? I know there's one line, hm, it's pretty long in the original, but paraphrased—— \n\"Should an operator fail to meet the needs of Rhodes Island, regardless of motivation or action, they are ineligible for onboarding. Conversely, should an operator appear with an origin or background subject to some scrutiny, as long as they meet our needs and strictly abide by our rules, they remain eligible...\" \nSomething like that! The original text is very dry and very long, so I won't go over it all right now. \nDoes anyone feel the need to ask \"why?\" Let me provide a simple example. \n\nSay there is some remarkable individual who comes highly recommended, with a remarkable set of personal ideals. In order to see their ideals realized, they sacrificed many people, destroyed entire cities, and ultimately succeeded. \nNo matter how great this individual or their ideals, Rhodes Island cannot accept them. We would be nothing but a platform for such a person. \nThen we have another individual, who has their share of problems. The things they do and the ways they do them may seem a bit unreasonable to us. This person submits a resume to Rhodes Island.—— \nSit down! I know you're all eager to say \"we already have a lot of operators like that!\" And there are indeed some! \nThink for a minute how many things happen each and every day in the many cities of the world. Can we settle them all ourselves? \nWhen an operator subjectively plans an action that would harm Rhodes Island's ideas, that operator is immediately expelled. When an operator intentionally violates Rhodes Island's rules and regulations, that operator may be eliminated before they can cause material harm. \nEven if! Even if the regulations are as they are, Rhodes Island has never once done such a thing, we have never seen such an action. Oh, not counting private wire connections. You can blame Closure for those! \nThe adjudication of whether or not an operator is eligible is dependent on his will, not his rap sheet. \nRhodes Island has the ability to observe and study its operators while also maintaining its rules and regulations. At Rhodes Island, some operators are at last able to achieve what they'd always hoped to do. \nAs long as we maintain contact with them, we will respect their choices, within reason, and never force them to act against their own will. \nSometimes, when there remains no other choice, such a thing may come to pass. \nI hope everyone understands this, just as they understand the Infected, and Rhodes Island's mission statement. \n\nFor all candidates, the most important thing is to find them their place at Rhodes Island, and to acknowledge Rhodes Island. \nWe must adhere to this in processing the applicants under this exchange agreement. Understood? \nAh, of course, the Waai Fu girl we just approved is perfectly fine. \n\"——When one is committed to constant reflection and tempering of his ideals, we are willing to serve as his forge. The bumps in this road, whether mine or yours... We will cross them together with our operators.\" \nI hope you all appreciate this quote from Theresa. \n\n ——Record of ■■■'s lunch meeting.",

I hope that everyone had an opportunity to preview the introduction last night.\nThe lions all claimed to be king, as the Dracos and Aslans each received equal opportunities. Under the terms of this ancient treaty, they were both qualified to become the sole monarch of Victoria. The Dracos symbolized unquenchable thirst for conquest, while the Aslans symbolized power through order. People believed that for countless generations, Victoria was influenced by three forces, including those two.\nLet's not even talk about how many bloody uprisings have been caused by the succession of the throne... Ever since ancient times, people have known that Victoria is not a friendly country capable of handling its own affairs internally. The Aslans originated in Sargon, Leithania, and even some other countries that have since been wiped out by Catastrophes. The Dracos, who were in power, had no reason to peacefully accept a group of outsiders, let alone allow them to rule their country.\nThe treaty that formed between the Aslans and Dracos could not have arisen in a stable and civilized environment. The most harrowing aspects of this history have been made light of, woven into a prologue for the legends that would follow. In this regard, the oral tradition preserved through gypsy bards and poets can be more reliable than \"official sources.\"\nHowever, there are always fragments of truth embedded within legends and tall tales.\nThough a modern state, Victoria has paradoxically sustained its ancient tradition of rule. As early as two decades ago, the Draco bloodline was considered to have been severed, leaving none to threaten the Aslan's firm rule over Victoria-\nWhat happened afterwards was covered in the second class session last month.\n\nHowever, the status quo of Victoria is not the focus of this lecture. What I would like everyone to consider is this: \"Granted that the contract between the Dracos and Aslans was engraved somewhere even more conspicuous than the throne itself, what would happen if there was still a Draco alive out there that could challenge the Aslan rule?\"\nNations that had been dissolved, ethnic groups which had been assimilated, civilizations that had been conquered... they all are waiting for a new banner.\nHowever, one must still consider that depending on the nature of the leader, the ideology that takes root - and the subsequent strength of the movement that it grows into - can be quite different.\n\nNevertheless, I still wish to remind everyone that this so-called \"history\" is happening around us right now, and the trajectory of the future may not be entirely determined by the origins of the ones who decided to set things into motion.\nAfter all...\nHmm? Look at the time... that about concludes things for today's lecture. For next week's class, I'd like everyone to turn to page 14, and familiarize yourself with the life of a typical Draco king and see how his image in history differs from how it is presented in legend. Then, we will discuss the reasons for these differences.\n\nYou had a question, Miss Istina?\nAh, of course. History is the cause of current events. As for my personal interests...\nWhen the Reunion Movement publicly announced its existence to a small number of political entities, most policymakers decided to respond to the threat of a show of power from the Infected with force; and a small number of them were so concerned that just the appearance of a Reunion leader would trigger an immediate response.\nCombined with the fact that Rhodes Island has secretly received some new patients recently, I am looking forward to a day when these lions will no longer rear their heads. After two fulminating red dragons suddenly emerged from the heir of the lost Draco clans, Victoria may once again be cast into a storm of unrest.\n\n\nHmm, if the testimony is true... there might even be three.\"\n\n--Recording of Rhodes Island Lecture No. 43, History of the Empire, Lecturer Hypatia",

Train, train, and train more to wield heavier and stronger equipment.\nIf you aren't durable enough for the job, or if you hurt yourself with your own Arts, find a way to overcome it. Bring more medicine, install a special pacemaker installed by a friend, get back onto your feet even if your head is spinning, and join the battle again.\nIf your combat skills still have deficiencies, then throw yourself into the most brutal battles, and make up for the lack of skill with experience. Arm yourself with the instinct that you've honed over countless battles.\nAfter that, integrate your Originium Arts into all your efforts. \nEven if your exam results can't get any better than \"Excellent,\" all the power you've mustered on the battlefield can bump that up to \"Super Excellent.\"\n\nThat's what it means to be an elite Operator of Rhodes Island.\nOf course, she still scratches her head when trying to slog through basic textbooks for her upper-level courses. But she does get through it in the end.\nSee, such is the nature of an elite Operator.\n\n--■■■",

At first, the Operator entrusted with taking care of her did not take her mental state to be a serious issue, given that she was still young and might be overwhelmed by her experiences.

During this time, GreyThroat remained isolated, trying to avoid contact with the various personnel within Rhodes Island. Someone once witnessed GreyThroat scraping at her own arm with a piece of industrial sandpaper, and was not discovered by staff until her arm had been turned into a bloody mess. The reason was because GreyThroat accidentally touched some Originium-based devices.\nWhile GreyThroat has not taken any radical behavior towards Infected persons, her actions have been a source of discontentment among many younger operators. The ostracized GreyThroat of course takes no issue with this fact, and continues to lead a relatively solitary life in Rhodes Island.\nThe only exception is Amiya, one of the few people she is willing to communicate with. Perhaps due to being separated from her family at a young age, her desire to speak with a peer for support sometimes even eclipses her prejudices. However, even when she is in the same room with Amiya, she carefully maintains her distance, exhibiting mild PTSD at the very beginning. At Amiya's suggestion, and in return for adoption into Rhodes Island, GreyThroat began training for the Operator assessment and learned to use bows and crossbows. Some were skeptical, claiming that it was just an excuse for GreyThroat to leave Rhodes Island, or even try to defect, but Amiya quickly put a halt to this, as well as other unfounded rumors.",

Even those who are vocally opposed to her conduct cannot deny her combat performance. On the battlefield, GreyThroat is far keener than Operators who have served for a similar length of time, her excellent dynamic vision compensating for her lack of marksmanship experience.\nHowever, can a Rhodes Island Operator shoulder her duties while being so hostile and disgusted towards the Infected? In order to address the concerns of others, Amiya personally took the initiative to put GreyThroat on her operation team, and successfully carried out several missions.\nSome people may be hard to change, but many hoped that Amiya would be able to gradually influence this somewhat abrasive girl. But, reality would once again surprise everyone. After a long and harrowing rescue mission, GreyThroat changed dramatically overnight. She began to learn to talk to the Infected, though she still would often touch upon topics that are typically off-limits for the Infected. Her tone was cold, and sometimes even full of barbs, but her frankness began to soften the hearts of many.\nVery few people know about what exactly transpired on that mission, with Amiya and GreyThroat both seldom mentioning it. What is certain, is that GreyThroat is no longer blinded by a myopic hatred. However, is her heart actually free from the shackles of hate? It is not that simple. People who seem to easily let go of a deep-rooted hatred are not trustworthy. After each physical examination following her return for a mission, GreyThroat repeatedly confirms her blood originium-crystal density, accompanied by a near-suffocating fear and subsequent relief, perhaps a reflection of the guilt and ensuing sorrow. GreyThroat still often wakes up with nightmares, and rarely has an opportunity to sleep, whether on a mission or in the Rhodes Island dormitories.\nGreyThroat is still her old self, not like Amiya, not like anyone else. But she will still fight for Rhodes Island, and nobody doubts this anymore.",

I'm not sure.\"\n\"From then on, I couldn't stay calm when talking to Infected people. Since I probably don't need to hide anything from you, Doctor, I'll be frank. In the worst cases, I felt like vomiting. Amiya is the exception though. I really appreciate her. Oh, but don't tell her I said that.\"\n\"But, I've also seen the Infected across this world. The hungry woman using her own blood to nourish a ghastly, malnourished child, exiled to the scorched soil of the barrens, or admitted to some \"clinic\" in name only to die. With no treatment and no food, they eat the soil at the base of the walls, surrounded by the inorganic, petrified bodies of those whose ridiculous lives have long expired. And what is on the other side of that wall? A peaceful, prosperous mobile city devoid of hunger.\"\n\"I have seen the exiled Infected rescue travellers, and I have also witnessed travelling doctors who help these Infected crushed by terror. After becoming an Operator, I have also become involved, trying to help those who have not joined a mobile city-state avoid Catastrophes. One incident still is fresh on my mind. One time, in the face of a flood, Infected villagers held back the water with their own flesh, buying just enough time for the evacuation. And so those Infected gave their lives, their bodies now floating on top of the water, but nobody cares. Do you know how the villagers view these heroes? With disgust. Whether they hate these people or the Originium crystals on their skin, I cannot say.\"\n\"And why is this happening? Amiya told me before, because everyone is a living person. Everyone wants to live, and has the right to survive.\"\n\"Did you know? When Amiya said these words, she did not look like a young girl at all. But I am not the same as her, and there is inevitably a difference between the Infected and non-Infected.

She is a force to be reckoned with upon the battlefield.\nShe never wears armor despite the fact that she serves as a heavy operator, and yet nobody has ever seen her get injured.\nTo explain this, Nian attributes her success to the special equipment she carries around.\nThe equipment functionally flows like water, capable of taking the form of a heavy shield or a strange sword. It is even capable of splitting into shards that can be dispersed across the battlefield, channeling some unknown technique to soften all kinds of blows that would have otherwise rained down upon teammates.\nAlthough Caster Operators have all come to the conclusion that there is little overlap between Nian's abilities and Originium Arts, that information is hardly relevant to her teammates.\nAs long as it works, anyone not just running logistics has little concern for how it works.

While most people find the ill-natured Aak to be impossible to deal with, Hung is his natural nemesis. If a situation with Aak truly became unbearable, just report it to Hung, and the situation will soon be resolved. While it cannot be said that Aak fears Hung, Hung unabashedly treats Aak like a little brother; and Aak, despite his usual attitude, probably sees Hung as an older sibling as well.\nThe second is Waai Fu. Though the righteous Waai Fu and the ill-natured Aak would seem totally incompatible, the two have unexpectedly developed a good relationship as members of the same detective agency. Waai Fu believes that Aak is a fundamentally good person, whereas Aak sees Waai Fu as old-fashioned but not impossible to get along with. By the way, if Aak is out looking for trouble, you should call Waai Fu instead of Hung. The ensuing scene is quite entertaining.\nThe third is Warfarin. After learning that the true identity of \"Mr. Blood\" was none other than Warfarin, even Aak, who had spurned mainstream medicine, couldn't help but to engage Warfarin in academic discussions on a frequent basis. Admittedly, Warfarin, whose views towards medicine differ slightly from other medics perhaps as a result of her longevity, and Aak, who is a bit of a freak himself, make an unexpectedly good duo. But as a caveat, when these two find out that they share some common interest and tastes, strange laughing and cheering have become far more prevalent than ever before - either from Warfarin's or Aak's lab, now with two voices instead of one.",

Not to mention, he frequently researches and develops medication that seems incomprehensible to the average person, such as pills that make farts smell like watermelon, or make people lose the ability to recognize a certain color.\nOf course, if you knew who his father is, this tendency is no longer so puzzling.\nAak's father used to be a well-known attending physician at the Lungmen Central Hospital and was renowned for his medical ethics. But due to a certain incident, he was framed by others for malpractice, after which his career plummeted and he disappeared from the public eye. The next time he reappeared, he had become a vicious illegal doctor in the underworld of Lungmen's black zone, with even Lungmen's gang bosses trembling at his feet. When this person perished a few years ago in a gang war, the entire Lungmen underworld breathed a collective sigh of relief.\nAak clearly inherited his father's mantle, both the good and the bad. Even as a teenager, he made a reputation for himself in the underworld. Without discipline, he perhaps would have walked down the same path as his father, eventually becoming feared as well. However, after meeting Hung, he joined Lee's Detective Agency, a move that can be considered a turning point in his life.",

Despite Aak's young age, his views towards medicine have already greatly surpassed that of even experienced doctors who have been immersed within the field for years.\nThe reason behind this is simple: because he left the mainstream medical circles, he no longer views medicine solely from the perspective of a pure doctor.\nPure doctors will think about problems within the scope of medical practice, preoccupied with how to better save people, often losing sleep or forgetting to eat in the process of developing new drugs. Most of Rhodes Island's medics fall under this category.\nHowever, Aak is different. He saw the limitation of medicine, and recognized that the existence of medicine was due to harm. Of course, a large proportion of this harm occurs naturally in the form of diseases, but because Aak grew up in the black zone, he saw more of the harm that people inflicted upon each other.\nOver time, he began to scoff at the idea of pure medicine, resenting his colleagues because they only knew how to save people. They would rush to the scene of a conflict, even the most advanced pharmaceuticals utterly powerless to stop the conflict from having broken out in the first place. The more lofty and prideful the medical profession, the more Aak came to hate it.\nOf course, Aak's thoughts are radical and fringe, with his daily behaviors reflecting a bit of his immaturity. Nevertheless, one cannot deny that his ideas are rooted in the bloody reality that shaped his upbringing, and events sometimes unfold in the way he describes. While Rhodes Island does pursue a lofty dream, it also never looks away from reality.\nAfter getting to really know him, several of Rhodes Island's core medic operators set aside their initial disgust towards him and, as his guardian Hung hoped for, decided to show him a better side of this world and provided him with the best possible conditions.\nAfter all, everyone knows that Aak is a genius, and over time, he will surely mature into a phenomenal doctor.",

While it must be said that Lee's Detective Agency prevented his sense of morality from going too far astray, his psychological issue had not been resolved. Of course, this is not to place the blame upon the agency, for psychological problems usually require professional help even to be detected. Moreover, a personality like his also requires the proper environment.\nAnd at Rhodes Island, Aak is recognized and accepted for who he is. Everyone tells him that he is just, and reminds him that he is the best at what he does. As for the crux of the reason he resents medicine, Rhodes Island is already addressing the issue - we never intended to rely solely on pharmaceuticals to solve all the world's problems.

(Note: This description was from Hung himself)\nRegarding Mr. Lee and Lee's Detective Agency, while it is not suitable to describe the scope of business in detail, here is a brief summary: Lee's Detective Agency only takes investigative cases as a front, while actually accepting just about any type of work. They are known as the \"House of Everything\" within Lungmen's gray zone.\nAccording to his description of Mr. Lee, we can conclude that Lee concealed a darker secret from Hung.

This misunderstanding was likely caused by the fact that she was excluded from the field for a long period of time, and did not have the opportunity to enter the high-tech field. In fact, Snowsant is even more talented than she is aware of.

As soon as Dobermann concluded her speech, Snowsant immediately shot up and approached Dobermann - nobody had ever seen her move so quickly before. Then, she bent over - in front of everyone in the room, picked up a coin, and stood back up. Even Dobermann did not know how to react at that time. Though Snowsant quickly seemed to realize her rude behavior, she stood there for a few seconds before shuffling back to her seat, trembling in front of the whole room.\nWe later learned that her purse had a small hole in it, and the purse was filled with coins that she had painstakingly scrounged up. Surprisingly, though Snowsant was fidgeting around for the coin almost the entire meeting, her notes were almost identical to what was given by Dobermann. We hope that the Operators prone to falling asleep during meetings can learn a thing or two from her diligence.\nAlthough sometimes this diligence reaches a level that makes others worried about her health, most Operators watch over her fondly as this frail girl carefully and painstakingly goes about her work.",

There are too many talented people surrounding them, which makes them underestimate their abilities, and they compensate through an almost stubborn work ethic, taking one step at a time.\nHowever, despite understanding each other in many regards and confiding in each other, after learning about Jessica's monthly expenditures on firearms, equipment, and Originium bullets, Snowsant once questioned Jessica's grasp of currency and basic mathematical knowledge. If you see the two eating together at a cafeteria, don't be surprised if you see Snowsant with an empty tray in front of her. While Jessica is certainly capable of helping Snowsant financially, she also knows the value of the sacrifices Snowsant is willing to make for her ideals. Perhaps, the two of them really can become each others' emotional pillar of support.",

After rigorously withholding what she needed for her research funds and squeezing anything out of her living expenses, she would send whatever was left over back to her hometown.\nIt is worth mentioning the industrial clawhooks that Snowsant carries with her. Reportedly, this clawhook is the first scientific achievement that Snowsant made by herself before leaving Lungmen. Obviously, she had no idea how to use patent rights and marketing to turn a profit for herself. She simply took this clawhook to participate in a certain regional industrial design competition, relying on the meager proceeds to buy a one-way ticket to Columbia to begin chasing her dreams.\nSnowsant has little confidence in her abilities, and though I don't know when, some very successful people who understood the value of her quiet diligence turned their attention towards her and invited her back to Lungmen when the time was right.",

Within it was but a piece of paper with the four words: \"Heaven rewards the hardworking.\"\nThough useless for her situation, Snowsant cheered up and found solace in those words.\nHeaven rewards the hardworking, and the proverb became reality.\nThree days later, Snowsant received an invitation from officials in Lungmen's upper echelons.

Of course, her priority is not so much becoming acquainted with people, but rather becoming acquainted with food. In the place where everyone gathers to eat, there is a certain door. On the other side is a world of countless edibles, waiting for her to sample. She's not particularly subtle in her efforts to sneak in, resulting in a high probability of being found and shown the way out. However, that doesn't seem to deter her - at least until she's tasted the contents of all the bottles and cans there.\nIn light of the fact that Ceobe is still learning about the norms of civilized life, everyone privately agreed to not punish her when she gets caught, and some people even took the opportunity to feed Ceobe some strange things. Though these people usually fall under one of three categories - the experimenters, the kind-hearted, and those who just wanted to make fun of her, Ceobe generally only has two words to say about the things she eats: \"Yummy,\" or \"Good.\" No one can coax any other words out of Ceobe - naturally, the experimenters can't get the kind of data they're looking for, the kind-hearted pretty much all get the same few responses, and those who try to make fun of Ceobe are undertaking a self-defeating task. Over time, the number of people casually trying to feed Ceobe decreased as well.\nAlthough she has indulged in many foods of all shapes and sizes since coming to Rhodes Island, if asked to pick out the food she loved the most, she would choose honey biscuits. As a matter of fact, honey biscuits are the only thing that she seems to be picky with - currently, she only accepts biscuits baked by Lava, Vulcan, and Matterhorn. She won't touch even a single crumb of the biscuits baked by anyone else - even by the logistics chief.\nSummary: She won't eat, but she absolutely can eat just about everything. She loves honey biscuits. If the day comes where she's in the mood to eat the entirety of Rhodes Island, she'll likely do just that.",

When being briefed on missions, she couldn't wrap her head around things like tactical simulations, but the Doctor had a brilliant idea - by giving her simple, concrete commands such as \"stand here,\" \"attack this,\" or \"fight until I arrive,\" she was able to complete her missions. As a result, Ceobe was able to save some brain cells, and the Doctor entered the ranks of the few people who Ceobe would completely set her weapons down around.\nOther than the Doctor, the person who Ceobe respects the most is Vulcan.",

              "storyText": "Ceobe's very first weapon was an axe with her name engraved upon it. Her curiosity led her to seek the meaning behind the axe, so she stopped to ask a question to the first person she could find - and thus began her life of wandering. Along the way, when she got hungry, she ate wild fruits. When she was thirsty, she drank water from the rivers. Her journeys took her away from most of civilization. Because she didn't have the ability to discern areas that were contaminated with Originium, Ceobe quickly contracted Oripathy, and what she described as \"black crystals\" started to appear across some parts of her body. At first, these growths were a source of fear for her, but as she continued to wander, she began to see the power that these crystals had brought her - her weapons had grown stronger. Ceobe's fears were soon replaced with a strong desire to obtain more weapons, an uncontrollable impulse that often drove her to resort to violence to satisfy. Though she tried to suppress these impulses and use peaceful methods to obtain weapons, the outcomes would often differ greatly from her expectations. Sometimes she would rescue others, sometimes she would injure them; Some would reward her with weapons for completing tasks for them, some would use weapons to try to lure her, while others would gift them to her with no strings attached. In any case, her journey took her far to the east, where a well-intentioned person told her that she had taken the wrong way. With her large collection of weapons and tales in tow, she turned around and returned west. Her journey finally came to an end when she attacked a Rhodes Island squad led by Fang while trying to obtain food.\nWhile Ceobe lacked the qualifications to become an Operator, the HR Department finally gave her an opportunity to take the Operator evaluation exam upon Vulcan's recommendation. She had no expectation of becoming an Operator, nor did she know what such a job entailed, but she still demonstrated a great desire to become one. After becoming a fully-fledged member in Rhodes Island, her daily routine of eating, drinking, and fighting, combined with medical treatment of her Oripathy, also alleviated her strange fixation upon collecting weapons. She has grown accustomed to her comfortable lifestyle, and hopes that her time her can last forever if possible...\nAs long as someone can unlock the secret of her axe.",

Because the enchanting process requires a suitable weapon to serve as a carrier, each enchantment will instinctively \"choose\" its own weapon and then, in accordance with the quality of the weapon, the enchantment will confer a different Originium Arts characteristic, such as flames, rocks, or ice. In the past, this ability was a subconscious process that she could not control, and therefore she didn't give much thought into it. Now, under the tutelage of Rhodes Island Operators, she is working hard to understand her unique skill: though she may never be able to master the fundamentals of Originium Arts through studying, she must learn enough to operate her skills on a basic level, which would be enough to help her achieve a baseline level of identification and control and strengthen her abilities all around. Today, Rhodes Island has developed a comprehensive learning plan for Ceobe, and as long as she is willing to sit down in a classroom and begin working on her literacy, we have reason to believe that she can become an excellent Arts user in the future.\n\"Feel free to dream.\" --Anonymous comments",

Many mature schools of Originium Arts share similar methods of inheritance - for example, Leithanians use movements, the Sarkaz lead through ceremonies, and various guilds of Arts practitioners conduct research, all for the purpose of passing down the theoretical and practical components of Originium Arts. As one of the traditional Originium Arts originating from Yan, Lei Fa has a deeper history than most other forms of Arts. As a system shrouded in mysticism, the requirements for practitioners of Lei Fa are also restrictive and physically demanding. Its inheritance system gradually evolved into a solemn ritual of sorts, much like the passage of power. The end result was that Lei Fa tacitly became synonymous with the position of power, subsuming the popular symbol of law enforcement, and even becoming a form of self-cultivation in the quest for spiritual transcendence. As for rumors of the physical basis of \"transcendence,\" I can only say that as an Originium Arts researcher outside of Yan's cultural circles... I must harbor a healthy amount of skepticism.\nObviously, Leizi exhibits a degree of pride for the Arts she uses.\nAccording to some officials, when she taps into her powerful Originium Arts, her hair will become very smooth.

The fact that they can focus on their goals and practically ignore all the rest of the background noise is good for their work.\nSome others are concerned, but are just keeping silent about the matter. For example, Ansel brought up the issue several times, but decided against it each time and left after dropping off some snacks. They've struck a good balance between curiosity and their sense of responsibility.\nOr, they simply don't know anything about it. I once witnessed Cuora getting lost and ending up in front of Leizi's dorm, only to have dinner with her before being sent back to Block A. Cuora will recount how they had four main dishes that night as well as a soup, concluding that Leizi is a very nice person, end of story.\nYet another type is those who have already been bound up and silenced, not even uttering a word about the matter even if tortured. Yesterday, I caught Blaze slacking off while I was on duty. Even though this time it was basically just bureaucratic busywork, and Blaze tends to use this time to get some rest and relaxation, she actually ran over to the intelligence room to go over files with the person who complains most often about her work ethic - Leizi. Amiya, who was standing at the doorway, even vouched for them before apologizing to me and pushing me out. She still had that faint smile as she waved me goodbye.\nSome of us are definitely going crazy, and I've begun to suspect that it's actually me. Having that said, this proves that in addition to gathering data, Leizi has a vested interest in \"maintaining amicable relationships with her targets.\" While it's true that she hasn't done anything yet, she also has been concealing her whereabouts from the rest of the world.\nAt first, I interpreted her application for long-term board as a form of rhetoric. In that regard, I admit I was in the wrong. It's just that to write this whole thing off as \"improving relationships\" is far too suspicious.\nHow ironic. Concealment and deceit have turned into a method of expressing trust, and turning a blind eye in order to coexist together has become the new norm.\nFortunately, the great powers have not turned their gaze upon Rhodes Island just yet, a neglect which has already saved us several times.\nOf course, if she was trying to spy on us, it would be stupid to walk in with an official state-sponsored identity. But that is precisely why we cannot rule out the possibility, and must do our best to maintain confidentiality and control the information going out.\n\nTo be honest, she is very good at her job. A pity that she is not one of our Operators.\nI can actually make some inferences about what happened to her before, and it's entirely understandable why she seems to be in a rather odd state.\nPerhaps now, the only proof of her true self is that tone of voice, and her golden locks that flow like electricity. I believe that she is in a self-imposed exile as a result of this case.\nNo matter where you are, there is a price to be paid for being selfless. If you fully dive into this cause, you will also give up your future. However, now that I think about it, surely the Central Judicial Office has no shortage of such personnel?\n\nI admire her courage and perseverance fleeing here by herself. That would be a reason to shelter her even if she didn't pull her weight.\nThe hardships that she must endure from here on out, and the path that she must take, may yet be unknown to her still. No, I'm sure she knows full well, but simply has chosen not to act upon it.\nSome people believe that those who work in the judiciary have a strong moral compass, and everyone can see that on display. In Leizi's case, she readily apologizes if she is wrong, and never toots her horn when she is right. You will never be able to get someone like her to stop bowing her head. It's a part of who she is.\n\nDespite her many virtues, a glaring blemish is her attitude towards the Infected. By the looks of things, this is not something that can be changed in a short time.\nHowever, just as day and night eventually blend together, I trust that a day will come when she understands the plight of the Infected. After all, she needs our help as well. I heard that Leizi spoke of a certain time in Yan, or a certain season... something involving the spring's first roar of thunder. The spring thunder is supposed to penetrate the darkness of the long winter.\nI'll look after her, provided I don't get pissed off to all hell by those who are keenly interested in her personal belongings, like Haze and Rope.",

              "storyText": "Of course, despite the fact that Miss Bagpipe gives off the impression of a cheery \"girl next door,\" the fact remains that she indeed was an official soldier in the Victorian army - and an excellent one at that.\nThe Victorian Royal Guard Academy is multi-directional in its educational framework. Unlike other systems of military training, this academy has its own educational policy: of the three directions, most graduates serve as guards for the royal family, nobles, or various dignitaries. Officers generally serve as senior-level commanders in the army, while sergeants generally serve as the army's field commanders and first responders. As a graduating sergeant, Miss Bagpipe undoubtedly possess exceptional military talent.\nIn fact, there are significant fundamental differences when comparing the training of Operators and soldiers.\nOperator training places more emphasis on individual and squad operations, cultivating along the lines of their aptitudes in order to maximize their strength. As reflected by Rhodes Island's collection of highly individualized personalities, Operators must capitalize on their uniqueness, cooperating to complete various objectives with the fewest number of elite Operators.\nOn the other hand, military training emphasizes the collective. The development of a corps is comprehensive, stressing the importance of standardization and interchangeability. The military tends to make decisions based upon overall functionality rather than upon individuals in order to ensure the stability and efficiency of the team.\nDue to this need for comprehensive training, a soldier's combat capabilities must be higher than that of an average qualified Operator. Nevertheless, these two roles scarcely warrant a comparison, because an Operator's job should not be applicable to war - this is something that is to be avoided as much as possible.\nAs a result, Miss Bagpipe is unable to directly become a role model for the other Operators when it comes to developing combat abilities. This was evident early on when Dobermann, Liskar, and Nearl, all professional soldiers, joined Rhodes Island. Though they quickly adapted to their new environment, their military training posed many striking contradictions with Rhodes Island's combat principles.\nHowever, Bagpipe, who passed the military training examination with perfect marks and served in the front lines on the battlefield, still is a prime example of what a good soldier in active service looks like. This should be a healthy wake-up call for certain Operators who think they can match the caliber of professional soldiers, or simply have no idea how the military works.\nThough the projectile function has been removed from her piledriver spear, the weapon itself is still a terrifying ordnance of war. Do not let your curiosity get the better of you - or your life.\nAdditionally, it is worth mentioning that whether due to her natural open-mindedness or due to Victoria's exceptional educational system worthy of its name, Miss Bagpipe did not require retraining when transitioning from a soldier to an Operator, adapting quickly to the new position.\nAs an Operator, she demonstrated the resilience and discipline of a soldier; as a soldier, she exhibited the flexibility and fluidity of an Operator. This has led to Dobermann commenting in private: \"Victoria's superiority over other countries... starts from the professionalism of their military.\"",

As everyone knows, Vouivre women tend to be very strong.\nSince she was a child, she helped her family with farming and animal husbandry. After joining Rhodes Island, she brought those valuable experiences over to the logistics personnel in charge of related matters. Her enthusiasm in these subjects even made some think that she was transferred to the logistics department.\nFurthermore, she is familiar with large-scale agricultural equipment. Unfortunately, due to space constraints, Rhodes Island's agricultural projects only allow for the use of small tractors, much to her dismay. After all, we can't simply hand over the entire ship to her. \nOf course, none of this means that Miss Bagpipe has no knowledge of modern life - she tried it, but failed. This is somewhat evident from her relatively frequent maintenance applications compared to the other Operators.\nAlso, according to her, she tried to learn how to apply makeup from her upper-crust classmates as a student, but the results were hopelessly embarrassing. She gradually gave up on developing herself in these areas, but she of course is still self-conscious about her appearance... Though she is impeccably dressed as a soldier, she seems to be rather anxious about her casual dress and appearance.\nBut those concerns are hardly warranted. After all, several Operators find her to be cute enough as she is.",

              "storyText": "This was mentioned above briefly, but in fact, if Bagpipe so desired, she could well obtain an enviable status in Victoria's Second Army. Victoria, as the most prosperous empire in Terra, is inseparable from its vast military might. As a sergeant, Bagpipe can also enjoy better treatment than regular foot soldiers, and that's not even factoring in her personal abilities... If she wished to pave a path from her role as an excellent officer to becoming a noble in the big city, there would be nothing in her way\nHowever, she rejected that path. Bagpipe chose to leave the army and her comrades-in-arms, even leaving Victoria behind to roam the dangerous land.\nHer decision to leave civilization and step out into the wilderness is a choice that ordinary city-state dwellers cannot comprehend. After all, leaving the security of civilization is practically a death wish. Bagpipe endured her arduous journey, travelling with Messengers, cooperating with mercenaries, catching whatever rides she could and accepting what little hospitality was available. Due to her identity and nationality, she was forcefully kicked out of some cities, drew the hatred of many, and even got pulled into dangerous conspiracies. According to her, \"I've seen it all.\"\n\nNow, she has arrived at Rhodes Island. The friendly Rhodes Island Operators were willing to join her in her struggles, extending a hand of assistance to this seasoned soldier. However, that was the moment her steps faltered.\nThe more she comes to understand Rhodes Island, the more confused she becomes. After going through a series of tests and information exchanges, she became agitated and unhappy upon learning of Reed's presence.\nWhat is it that is weighing down upon her mind? What kind of problem exists that could not be solved by Victoria's military? What happened in Victoria, and what did she and her regiment encounter?\n\n\"I used to be a soldier of Victoria. This doesn't seem... to be a responsibility of Rhodes Island. Although I'm no longer in the army, I'm sorry. I... I still am responsible for this. This is part of our duty, and also why we left.\"\nMaybe it's not the right time yet.\nMorever, even though everyone looks up to her as a model soldier, the Bagpipe who toils hard in the fields, the Bagpipe who carries three saucepans over to the table, the Bagpipe who sings and spins while wearing a long skirt, the Bagpipe who regales us with dazzling tales of her hometown...\nEveryone loves that side of her too.",

Instead, she, as an Operator, decided to try to open up, albeit slowly and carefully. \nShe might be scared, but she can't run away forever.\nAt least, if one was to consider \"Rhodes Island's Most Likeable Ranking,\" she and Grani unsurprisingly topped the list.

He simply continued forward, striving to catch up to his esteemed older brother - a brilliant, sensible, eloquent, and proficient prodigy who had already secured various patents for his inventions. Sesa threw himself at his studies to be admitted to the same prestigious school as his brother with the hope of one day working with him.\nSesa's brother, seven years his elder, worked for a massive military contractor in Columbia after graduation, and put together the company's largest research lab. Six months before his graduation, Sesa finally arrived at the military laboratory for an internship. However, a cruel twist of fate separated the two brothers, when an explosion from an experimental accident claimed the life of his older brother. The sudden loss of his older brother shattered the goal he had poured himself into so ardently his whole life. With his excellent grades, he was still able to continue his education, but he immediately rejected an invitation to stay at the lab and left the college after barely graduating.\nSesa secluded himself in his room for a long time until one day, he left a letter to his father and departed.",

His name soon became a mainstay in the black markets due to his reputation for excellent craftsmanship. Surprisingly, Sesa's own talent for Originium Arts is not enough for him to easily master the use of Originium equipment. In fact, he struggles to operate even the most basic of Originium weapons. For this somewhat famous weapon modifier, the reality seems a bit hard to believe as well, and this is perhaps the reason for the modifications he's made upon his own grenade launcher.\nLater, when we investigated the laboratory incident, we found that Sesa's late brother, as the leader of the military laboratory, was far more proficient in Originium Arts than Sesa.\nThis may be the reason why Sesa has gone through such painstaking efforts, tapping into a far greater talent so that he too may be able to pick up a grenade launcher.",

We found it difficult to believe that such an accident could take place in one of Columbia's most prestigious military laboratories. With this bit of skepticism in mind, we uncovered the greatest doubt of this whole incident: the fact that it was an illegal experiment.\nIn reality, the military giant that Sesa and his brother worked for did not focus on Originium firearms that can only be used by a select few, as the versatility and lethality of such weapons generally fell short of just applying Originium Arts to traditional crossbows.\nThough the most crucial information can only be understood by Columbian military and government officials, according to some contacts, we have every reason to believe that the project the two brothers pursued is the same one that Sesa has mastered - eliminate the high barrier of entry of using Originium firearms. This can also explain why the company has not faced any backlash from either the government or the private sector despite such a major accident. The person in charge of the ill-fated experiment has even risen through the ranks, becoming a point of resistance that even Rhodes Island cannot continue to investigate. \nIt must be noted that even though Sesa's work has been described with awe on the black market, all he can do is enhance existing weaponry. Though Sesa might come closer to it than most people, the idea of \"letting anyone pick up an Originium firearm even without being able to use Arts\" is inherently not feasible and not allowed. Originium-based technology might still have its limitations, but if certain people throughout Terra catch wind of these developments and attempt to use this technology to escalate geopolitical conflicts, there is no telling what kind of brutal, all-consuming wars we may face in the future.\n\"The power I deliver is growing closer to the real deal, and it is both dangerous and eye-catching... So, uh, that's why it's absolutely necessary to keep this technology under wraps!\" He explained it himself.\nBut if this is true, is it possible that the person responsible for the accident that buried Sesa's brother... Sesa himself? Despite attempts to verify this, Rhodes Island has no right to pry into a subject that he seeks to avoid.",

This is not a legend in the sense of a superstition passed down, but rather a summary of chilling events that occurred one after another over a period of 3-4 years in a mansion built in the middle of the lake. After fully exploring this “cursed island,” a few courageous investigators and explorers were only able to bring back a young girl who seemed to be a blood relative with the island’s owner, along with some attendants who had been shocked into a near-comatose state.",

Prolonged exposure to this Originium-dense environment unknowingly awakened Originium Arts within the young girl, and prolonged contact through potable water, food, wound sites, etc., further exacerbated her rampant and uncontrollable Arts. After learning about this situation, Miss Shamare was quickly transferred to the Rhodes Island landship for medical treatment and management. Although the locals were more than happy to send away this “plague god” as if they were saved, we know that Miss Shamare is but another victim of this incident. \nMiss Shamare is still a child, even younger than Amiya is. I hope all of you keep this in mind. Her rampant Originium Arts is vastly more noteworthy than her experiences as an Infected.

She often uses the doll she always keeps on her, which she calls “Morti,” to express her thoughts. In addition, Shamare also demonstrates interests that are incomprehensible to others, frequently talking to herself using antiquated jargon. At first, Medics thought this was possibly a symptom of contracting Oripathy at such a young age. Later on, when visiting the attendants who were responsible for taking care of Shamare, we found that many of them did not blindly heed the myths and rumors, and even after becoming aware of the various possibilities, still chose to regard Shamare with malice and ill will. While most of them have expressed regret for these sentiments, the truth is that every time they would leave the island, they would quietly plead with the ferrymen to take them away. When they got into town, they were often viewed as accomplices to some horrific crime even though they were merely shopping, a testimony to the unfair treatment they would receive. Understandably, no amount of good intentions can offset the withering bombardment of negativity. \nOver time, the townspeople who didn’t know the truth came to establish the dominant narrative, and even the attendants who had stayed with the young girl for many years started to view her in the same light. Overall, it can be said that the effect of the environment and her upbringing played a far greater role in the development of Shamare’s character than Oripathy itself.",

Although our current understanding of Originium is not enough to explain all the secrets of Terra, it is nevertheless highly undesirable to simply categorize the unknown as “curses.” We hope that all Operators will try their best to remain sensible and approach Miss Shamare with a normal mindset, as this too provides valuable guidance to her education. We should all think rationally about the “supernatural events” happening around Shamare, and believe that there are naturalistic explanations for these phenomena...\nAddendum: So far, no one has fully elucidated Shamare or the mystery of her Originium Arts. Yet nevertheless... all we can do is believe that these are indeed due to Originium Arts. Looking back, yet more rumors circulate regarding that Siracusan lake... and there are discrepancies between what those stories describe and what we’ve managed to test Shamare for.

At first, we thought that her references to “divinations” and “curses” were coping mechanisms to deal with her environment over time or perhaps due to the fact that her Arts subconsciously harmed others in the area, resulting in her attributing everything to the work of evil spirits in order to understand what was happening around her. \nBut based upon Shamare’s performance in some missions, as well as bits of data gathered from Originium Arts tests, we were all surprised to find that Shamare’s Originium Arts do far more than strongly influence the consciousness of others. Notably, she borrows the spells of “Morti” to inflict observable physical damage to enemies. Are mental suggestions strong enough to cause deviations in a target’s brain function, enough so to cause rupture and hemorrhaging? Although this hypothesis is quite tantalizing, it is fundamentally a fantasy from the perspective of modern Originium Arts technological research. Even more strikingly, her predictions and divinations are sometimes surprisingly accurate. For example, the last time we secretly replaced the Originium fiber filling inside Morti with ordinary cotton, she very unhappily divined the misfortunes that would befall a number of us. Some of these predictions included taking a fall from a chair breaking, getting hit by an unknown passing-by Sankta, and getting lacerated by broken test tube fragments - all of which came true! There’s a bruise on my head, you say? Hm? And this is because we’re supposedly already affected by her spiritual suggestions...? \nThat... can’t be right, can it? Ahem... We’ve got to have a bit more trust in our patients, don’t we! Even if Shamare can’t fully control her powers at times, there’s no way she’d be able to influence the entire research team without our notice, right? At least the recorder should be able to remain objective about this! \nMore importantly, whose dumb idea was it to give her a doll with that weird Originium stuffing anyway? Don’t you know it’s dangerous to give Originium-based products to Shamare? ...I approved it? Seriously... I did?",

In the past, she always wanted to go far away from Corinia to see different facets of life, but after some time as a mercenary, she realized she would never be able to flee from Corinia, the heart of Minosian trade as well as her splendid motherland. However, her struggle was not fruitless - in her line of work, she came across two other nomadic city-states that rivaled her home: Athenus, the spiritual garden of Minos, and Lakedaímōn, the sacred ground of warriors. In these places, she was able to encounter different philosophies as well as different ways of life, and at the same time, it was in these places that the vast world beyond Minos was revealed to her. One day, she will leave her home and travel to a new country. If Corinia taught anything to Sideroca, it is perhaps a lifelong desire for exploration and a deep pragmatism.",

As long as the task can be successfully completed, she cared not for the experience, or lack thereof, of the person carrying out the task. By the time Sideroca officially joined Rhodes Island, she had an impressive track record of zero tasks failed, even completing tasks that allowed the mercenaries to abandon their goods in order to ensure their own safety. Of course, her accomplishments also came at a price, perhaps evident by the extra scars across her body. After several years of cooperation, the head of Rhodes Island’s Minos branch decided to grandfather her into the main organization - after all, she didn’t want this trusty talent to be snatched up by competitors.

While this is beneficial to completing the task, it can also be unsuitable for employers who wish to conceal information from their mercenary hires. The head of Rhodes Island’s Minos branch once gave her the following advice: “Only take on short-term contracts, or stick with one employer until retirement.” She understands that Sideroca’s cold personality cannot conceal her inner dedication and work ethic. By working under the right employer, it is possible to achieve twice the outcome with half the effort, but once... because of this very reason, when she learned that the Minos Foreign Trade Union was attempting to strike a long-term deal with Sideroca, she went directly to Sideroca to snag her up before she could sign that contract. When representatives from the Trade Union arrived at Sideroca’s temporary residence, she had already left Minos to start a new life at Rhodes Island.

She says that while it is normal for people to proactively improve themselves during Hell Week, it is inexplicable that someone would ever want to put themselves through Hell Week ever again. In her eyes, Sideroca is the kind of person who can incorporate a brutal regimen like Hell Week as part of their own regular fitness routine, even with already excellent qualities. Because Sideroca kept signing up again and again, Dobermann put her foot down and no longer allowed Sideroca to take the same courses as fresh recruits - after all, that would only serve to intimidate them. Consequently, Dobermann put together a specialized regimen, delving into new training manuals, standard army training, and special operations training and incorporating them to meet Sideroca’s needs. She even made an agreement with Dur-nar afterwards, gaining her support in exchange for compromises in some other areas, in order to work together against this person who constantly made the life of the instructors that much harder. Eventually, they discovered that only two things could tear Sideroca away from this almost self-destructive urge to train - going out on missions, or diverting her attention onto the Doctor. Thus, after they deliberately “leaked” some information about the Doctor’s recent malady, Sideroca poured all her energy and enthusiasm into taking care of the Doctor.

According to his own account, he did consider becoming a messenger prior to joining Rhodes Island, a career plan that is now on hold. \nIn fact, Elysium’s sense of direction is so strong that he can remember any place he’s ever been to, as well as being able to mentally map out a course of action with surprising accuracy. However, the maps that he comes up with often are not cost-efficient or practical, and he sometimes has to simplify these routes to facilitate better understanding and realizability — and yet, none of this meticulousness is carried over to his daily life.",

A Special Ops team’s line of work can be very dangerous, and Elysium’s role during these operations is sometimes even more important.

But this courage is not the flag-waving kind that gets people riled up before they charge off to war, but rather something more practical. \nWhen operators such as Elysium are present on the battlefield, the commander can better focus on understanding the overall situation, and individual operators can fight with the peace of mind that the operation plan is being executed.

Only through Elysium’s assistance is the leader able to normally communicate with others, and this responsibility may perhaps be the reason why Elysium chose to stay in Rhodes Island. \n\n“Even though it seems like he’s always getting smacked around, they’re actually on very good terms.” \n“Smacked around? Is the leader of the 3rd Squad such a vicious person?” \n“Hmm, I wouldn’t say that. The leader’s actually an introverted person, despite trying to maintain a cool and calm appearance... Whatever happens, it’s usually because Elysium is such a pain in the ass!” \n—Conversation between a member of the 3rd Squad and a member of the HR Department\n\nOnce Elysium has recognized someone as reliable, he will display his trust in his own special way, which may manifest in the form of nonsensical dialogue, or through increasingly preposterous bets.

Scientists have found that by combining biological theory with the experience of engineering, they are in a better position to solve various problems encountered in the fields of biology and medicine. This new discipline quickly became closely linked to the practice of medicine. \nEspecially for a company like Rhodes Island that seeks to develop drugs to inhibit and treat Oripathy, a bioengineering laboratory can be said to be a necessity. \nHowever, even if Rhodes Island offers a favorable salary compared to the rest of the industry, it is well-known as a pharmaceutical company that specializes in Originium research and Oripathy treatment. Naturally, these are subjects that would discourage most people. \nBut even setting this point aside, the fact that Rhodes Island needs to be mobile, and the existence of tech companies such as Rhine Lab that can provide a better baseline, has caused Rhodes Island to be at a disadvantage when competing for talent. \nFurthermore, Rhodes Island is not purely a pharmaceutical company, and many prospective employees decide to leave after learning about Rhodes Island’s true purpose. \nAll in all, despite the considerable successes of Closure's Engineering Department in attracting a vast amount of talent, Rhodes Island's recruiting efforts are far from enough to meet the scope of the challenges. Closure can often be heard complaining about these difficulties, but she knows that there is little that can be done to improve the situation. \nDespite these conditions, there is, according to Closure, one department that she never has to worry about, and that is the Bioengineering Department led by Weedy.",

Setting aside the complicated relationship between Laterano and Ægir, Iberia is a land full of flair and friendly to scientific research, although this friendship is conditional. \nA tacit understanding exists within the scientific community that one is free to conduct whatever research they choose within certain fields; and undeniably, Iberia has made substantial achievements in these fields. However, some fields of research are completely forbidden; or perhaps more accurately, in Iberia, those fields of research do not exist. \nTo do justice to the modern history behind this situation would require an entire encyclopedia’s worth of writing, so I will omit that here. However, bioengineering does exist in Iberia, or Weedy would not have been able to become an expert in the field at such a young age. Naturally, this was a result of her continuing her family’s research. \nAdmittedly, the above description makes it sound as if Weedy is seeking asylum in Rhodes Island to escape persecution, but this is actually a necessary background explanation based upon existing intelligence. \nWeedy joined Rhodes Island simply because she no longer wanted to stay in Iberia, and wished to see more of the world. According to her own account, there were virtually no barriers to her leaving, but she was also told that it would be significantly more difficult to return to Iberia - to which she had no particular sentiments. She received an offer from Rhodes Island shortly before receiving an offer from Rhine Lab. \nWeedy is not shy about mentioning her belief that Rhine Lab is better suited to her work than Rhodes Island is, but whenever this topic is brought up, she will tack on the phrase, “but I think Rhodes Island is pretty good too.”  \nOf course it is. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have chosen to set foot upon the battlefield either.",

The team gained notoriety for its frequent raids on commercial Laterano convoys, and many of its members have claimed their guns as trophies. These guns, often awarded as part of a formal ceremony, fetch a very high price at the Scar Market, Kazdel’s infamous black market. W herself still has a number of these guns in her collection, but it was marked as contraband and confiscated following her onboarding in order to avoid arousing the ire of our Laterano operators. Among the many weapons she uses is an explosives-launching device with obvious signs of modification. As for its provenance... after thorough consideration, we decided to not investigate the matter further. \nFollowing the conclusion of the war, W accepted an offer from Talulah to fight for Reunion as a mercenary, thus becoming one of Reunion’s accomplices. Subsequently, W unilaterally broke off her cooperation with Reunion and reached an agreement with Rhodes Island that continues to this day. From the above, we most likely have no way of determining W’s specific role during the Kazdel Civil War, her motivation in joining and then quickly betraying Reunion, or her purpose in cooperating with Rhodes Island. We know nothing about her history from the onset of the Kazdel Civil War to the time she joined Reunion. Considering that W is still a mercenary, and also factoring in what she did during the incident with Reunion, we urge all ordinary operators to keep their distance from W as much as possible, and also urge all departments to exercise caution when dealing with these dangerous collaborators. \n[Classified Log]\nYou want an ordinary operator to keep tabs on W? Isn’t that asking too much? They'd lack critical information. But since we’re old acquaintances, why not let me take care of it? \nFine, fine. We should be thankful W rarely needs to stay aboard the landship. Everyone hates her as much as they fear her, but how could things be that simple? What I’m asking is: how complicated could she be? If you know what she used to be, you should know how to get along with these lunatics. Her skills are the real deal - otherwise, how would she have been able to pull all her mercenaries from Talulah? But don’t worry, even if she dared pull something on us, Dr. Kal’tsit would see right through it. \nStill, we should definitely keep our distance from her. Especially for our adorable operators who don't get how the world works. W could really upset them. As for our elite operators... I worry that equal parts conflict and alcohol could spark an explosion that ends up destroying half of the ship, if not all of it. I hope that never happens. I’m serious. \nFinally, please remember that as members of the HR Department, we would never recruit an unstable person into the ranks of Rhodes Island. That's the most important condition for employment, after all. So the possibilities are twofold - first, the situation is dangerous enough to demand such measures, or second... we’ve always known the truth. Or it could be a bit of both. Wouldn’t you agree? \n—■■■",

Each of them worked in small teams, sometimes being recruited by nobles with vast funds and supplies, other times forming spontaneous coalitions with other mercenary teams. In Kazdel, where allegiances shift like the sands and various groups frequently find themselves at each others’ throats, the concepts of life and death take on a different form than compared to any other region. For the soldiers mired in conflicts across the regions, becoming mercenaries has become an increasingly popular option.  In the history of modern warfare, the topic of “Sarkaz mercenaries” has always been a subject of intense debate. Some Sarkaz mercenaries were sponsored by someone outside of Kazdel who was both well-equipped and skilled in local strategic configurations, an alarming arrangement that posed a security challenge to all parties. As a result, professional forces dedicated to counteracting the Sarkaz mercenaries have been formed, though specific details are not yet available. \nAfter the incumbent regent clashed with the orthodox royal family to spark the civil war, the remnants of Kazdel’s army which had been scattered among various nobles began to gradually unite with civilian forces, eventually being split into factions. The fighting was brutal and harrowing, but some scholars believed that the Civil War allowed a new process of redistribution and restructuring to take root in the barren and chaotic Kazdel. Although the heirs of the orthodox royal family were expelled from Kazdel, they were still supported by various ancient clans and noble families who pitched their massive economic power into unifying a large number of mercenaries, effectively gathering these scattered warriors under a king’s banner. This event is considered to be the official start of the mercenaries’ prominent role in the Civil War. Shortly afterwards, the regent’s side returned fire and did the same. As a result, most mercenaries were brought under one of these major banners, which to some extent eroded the original meaning of the term, “mercenary.” Despite this, there still remain a small number of mercenaries who are unwilling to get shackled down to this unsurvivable conflagration, and still struggle to maintain an independent position between the two main groups. They believe that mercenaries, or rather, Sarkaz as a whole, should be free. Their deeds are widely circulated as legends among the civilians of Kazdel, albeit having been heavily embellished for artistic purposes. \n—”Struggle and Freedom” Chapter 2 - “Kazdel and the Modern History of Mercenaries,” excerpt. This book came from W’s personal belongings, and the author’s name is unexpectedly abbreviated to only the letter “H.” The sentence, “Sarkaz should be free,” is highlighted in red.",

Miraculously, from Kazdel to Ursus, then to Lungmen to today, and maybe on into the future, we’ve continued to move forward, but we still meet the same people we started this journey with - only now, with the far-reaching effects they left behind. And once again, I have to come to terms with the fact that there are things in this life that we can't avoid, or run from. I talked to Ms. Kal’tsit and Amiya, and even brought a bunch of snacks to bribe Closure with - and everyone had a different opinion. \nI begged ■■■ to please let me talk to you, Doctor. Even though you might not recognize me anymore, I feel like I have to talk to you about something. You just have to keep thinking of me... as a Sarkaz boiler worker. \nI wanted to talk about W. I’ve known W for a long time. Did W mention this to you... while She was still alive? About Her Majesty. Us “old Operators” swore to never speak of this again, but it’s not because we’re trying to hide anything from you, Doctor. The reason is simple - none of us are willing to confront that past. Ms. Kal’tsit... also knows about this, of course. Hm? Don’t worry, I checked in with her before I came by. There are some things I can't do as thoroughly as she'd like, so I'm just here to have a little chat. \nBack to W - in the beginning, she was a kid, who only knew to follow Her Majesty’s orders, and nobody else’s. Even among the then-unified Sarkaz, not many people knew about W’s existence. What about Amiya, at the time? They wouldn't have met each other by then; after all, she had just enlisted as a mercenary. Unscrupulous, cynical, and flashing that devil-may-care smile. As for me, I was just a boiler worker at the time who had never seen a battlefield— huh? That's right, I built these muscles at work... I just got lucky and beat that elite operator at arm wrestling... I've never been on the battlefield. I don't know how extreme the soldiers thought W was, and I don't know why they thought she was unstable. I've never seen her in a fight, except she came back from a mission, trailing behind Her Majesty, thinking it's not her place to even say hello.  The way I see it, she was trying to follow Her Majesty. Following Her ideals, Her light, just like every Sarkaz before. \nBut W isn't that person anymore. There aren't very many people at Rhodes Island who know about W. But most of the people W knew are gone now. She wore her disguise... for too long, and it sank in too deep. She used to have some friends. Yes, even someone like her still needs the help and companionship of friends. They used to all fight alongside us, and though it wasn't for a very long time, if those friends were still here today, they might still be able to lend her a helping hand. Now, I'm thinking there isn't a single person is left who can help her. That's right, nothing we can do. Nothing you or Dr. Kal'tsit can do, and I'd get it if nobody wanted to do this anyway. But we shouldn't take that for granted. \nWe all want to know what W is after, and what her plans are. In her eyes, is Rhodes Island just a flash in the pan, or a brand new future to carry the hopes of the past? That's a very important question, maybe even more important to people still haunted by the past. That includes Amiya, and even Ms. Kal'tsit. It also matters to how W will handle her relationship with Rhodes Island in the coming days, as well as with Amiya, Ms. Kal'tsit, and even you. \nHm? Oh. There's a simple reason I came to see you. You might not remember the past, but the people from your past keep popping up, one by one. Some are trusting, some not so much, and I'm sure you must be having a hard time dealing with them... Haha, too bad I'm just a lowly boiler worker with no place to worry about the Doctor of Rhodes Island. \nMs. Kal'tsit and Amiya may be able to take good care of you, and also keep Rhodes Island in steady, continued operations. But W... is nothing like them. Whether she's coming at you, or the other way around, I just hope both of you can keep calm and don't be hasty. \nI wanted Amiya or Ms. Kal’tsit to tell you this stuff, or at least have it delivered by ■■■. Everyone gave up and let me do it, but truth be told, I'm also pretty nervous. \nI mean, I'm just your typical, run-of-the-mill Sarkaz. I can’t do crazy Arts or swing big swords and axes - if anything, I’d just drop them on my feet. The best I can do is to take care of my own work. All I hope... is that Rhodes Island can keep on trucking across the world, safely. \nHm? You have a question for me? Theresa? You... where’d you hear that name? \n... Theresa, huh? \nMaybe it won't be so long before you have to truly face your past.",

But as the situation worsened and the Catastrophe arrived, the line of defense was torn down, with violence and panic engulfing the entire city like a wildfire. \nThe Ursursians who remained struggled amidst the despair to cling to their lives, working together with a small team of local police officers after the Catastrophe. In a short period of time, this group went from initially trying to maintain order and protect civilians, to a state of being unable to fend for themselves, even stealing food to survive. When Rhodes Island’s rescue team found Absinthe, she was laying on her back amidst a heap of rubble, alone and dying from hunger. If the rescue team showed up any later, there is no saying what would have happened to her. Perhaps not even her body would have been left in place. \n\nThrough the entire crisis, the survivors trapped in the city waited for the arrival of those tasked with protecting them, but help never arrived.",

She may not have been gifted with great athleticism or combat acumen, but her tenacity coupled with the basic training she had received helped her quickly grow into a qualified operator. However, her lackadaisical attitude towards getting injured during training and exceedingly cavalier lifestyle habits are causes for concern. \nThe medical department’s assessment shows that Absinthe’s mental health markers are troubling; she views many issues with significant pessimism, and also displays degrees of self-loathing and self-destructive tendencies. This Ursus girl rarely seeks to establish personal agency in her daily life, instead subconsciously trying to help others around her. However, at the same time, she belittles her own actions to the point of even negating whatever results she may have achieved, a behavior that, in the eyes of the medic operators, is very concerning. \nAnother important issue to bring up is the strong concerns raised by the Ursus Student Self-government Group. Before joining Rhodes Island, Absinthe knew nothing about the members of the Self-government Group, and vice versa. It is unclear why Absinthe now pays so much attention to their activities, and she is unwilling to talk about the matter. These anomalous behaviors may have something to do with her past experiences in Peterheim Middle School. We can surmise that there must be some undiscovered facts regarding the time she spent there. \nUnder the premise that this status will not cause damage to Rhodes Island, related background investigations have been temporarily suspended out of respect for Operator Absinthe.",

Before Chernobog’s residents realized what was going on, much of the city had already been occupied. \nWe can reconstruct an account of what happened in the incident’s aftermath based upon oral narratives from survivors. Reunion’s leaders partitioned the city and controlled different zones, with certain zones being controlled more strictly than others. In certain places, people could remain unharmed as long as they stayed behind closed doors. But many citizens in other areas were not so lucky... You already know what I mean by that. Certain Reunion leaders encouraged the Infected to “claim their legitimate rights,” which is a euphemism for allowing gratuitous violence. When an excessively emotional catharsis morphs into hivemind behavior, one can imagine the kind of disaster that would ensue.  \nPolice? Compared to the sheer number of Infected who had given in to fanaticism, the amount of peace officers and military police simply was too small. While they were better equipped and trained than the average Reunion rioter, that alone was not sufficient, and the following Catastrophe tore through what little defenses were left in the city. The Chernobog police continued to send backup requests to the garrison during this time, but judging from the results, such attempts were futile. \n\nHow did that girl stay alive in those conditions until the time she was rescued? What kind of things did she have to go through? \nI won’t ask her to answer those questions. I can see that she’s doing well enough with us, and despite her doubts and anxieties, she’s making an effort to understand what happened in the past and shake off the lingering effects of those events. I even saw her trying to make friends, to try to be more inviting and to not push others away. This is no easy feat, and it is also a good sign. There’s no way we could heartlessly pry open those wounds. We all need to be more cautious and circumspect when dealing with people who have suffered through disasters.

After that, Rhodes Island operators will escort them to their chosen destinations so that they may start a new life. At the same time, some of the refugees will end up staying with Rhodes Island for a variety of reasons. \nAbsinthe’s parents were confirmed to have passed away during the Chernobog incident. When the logistics operator confirmed other kinship ties with Absinthe, the latter rejected the offer to be sent to another city and voluntarily applied to join Rhodes Island. Without a doubt, what she had experienced during the last month had driven her to make this decision. \nThe devastation wrought by Reunion’s occupation, the destruction caused by the Catastrophe, and the ugly face of today’s complex conflicts - all of these may have well played a role. As the turmoil continued, a shortage of food and drinking water turned these conflicts into something much simpler and more primal. Whether Infected or not, status mattered little when the only thing that remained was a cruel struggle for basic necessities. \n\nThe Medical Department has been closely monitoring the mental health of all survivors of the Chernobog-Lungmen incident. Unlike the members of the Ursus Student Self-Government Group who also escaped from Chernobog, Absinthe’s depression and pain takes on a much more direct manner. She rarely shows a real smile, and very few people are able to approach her. More often then not, Absinthe chooses to stay far away from others and maintain a subdued silence. Nevertheless, Absinthe has already helped many people; she may be taciturn, but she is undoubtedly reliable. Perhaps Absinthe views her own actions as trivial and insignificant, but we believe that kindness begets kindness and eagerly look forward to Absinthe’s future development. \nJust like the hair that she cut herself, perhaps only time can heal her scars.",

Yeah, we’ve been ‘ere for a few years, and heard something a couple years back. \nWhat the ‘ell’s going on with Victoria these days? Us folks have been dealing with Victorians for quite some time now, so we’ve seen things. Since the mining rush started, we’ve been seeing caravans carrying some odd gadgets. A few years ago, they suddenly stopped showin’ up, and we’d occasionally see people clad in common Victorian clothes collapsin’ by the side of the road. Often frail-lookin’ women, children, and the elderly too. Y’see, even a well-trained Messenger has to bring enough supplies, and wouldn’t dare set out without a vehicle. But you look at these people who can’t even get in a caravan, tryin’ to cross such a vast expanse outside of any jurisdiction. Who can manage something like that? \nDidn’t find out about this ‘til later, but apparently one of the boys on our town’s mining ship heard from somewhere that a number of years back, before the mining rush really picked up steam, a number of Victorian steam barons came by our mining towns to sign off some limited permits with the trade union. After these barons paid their dues, they extracted some ore, set up their factories when they got back, and made a small fortune. Naturally, power gathered in the hands of these people, and the industry grew bigger an’ bigger. Even a few small nomadic cities got built between the route from here to Victoria. But recently, the supply of ore dried up all of a sudden and nobody knew what was goin’ on. They sent a handful of prisoners who had been stripped of their rights to a site in Rim Billiton and had ‘em illegally snatch up the ore there. Our union here at Rim Billiton had its hands tied for a variety of reasons, and this situation continued until the “Cage Incident” broke out.\n—Transcript of a conversation at a mining town tavern in Rim Billiton",

Please rest assured, Victorian officials will know to hold their tongues regarding this matter. Or rather, I would infer that someone is currently pulling the strings behind the scenes to hand control of the autonomous precinct to Rim Billiton in the future. \nYes, and I fear that it is going all too well. The rushed implementation of the new ruling aristocrats’ short-sighted policies, the exile of criminalized political opposition, leaked news regarding hostages, the negligence towards the armed forces and domestic defense, and the laissez-faire nature of the Victorian government... have all set the stage for a brewing conflict. \nAmong these cases, an executive official’s handling of a political offender’s family created a particularly unreasonable hostage situation. Women and children were forced into cages under dilapidated facilities and sent to work in dark mine shafts, never to see the light of day in a way that was tantamount to murder. After news of this abhorrent practice broke, public outrage was inevitable. These new aristocrats, the visionary entrepreneurs who capitalized upon Rim Billiton’s mining craze, should never have allowed this to occur, let alone make such a stupid decision... unless the decision itself is part of a much larger transaction. \nRegardless, this is not a problem that can be solved by a former clerk who was reduced to a “bandit” after being persecuted and jailed for participating in a union protest against their radical pact. But I do have some other ideas, namely about the talent referrals that your company mentioned in the past. \nPresumably your company has done some research beforehand, and it should be clear that in this incident, the kindness and enthusiasm of Rim Billiton’s workers played a vital role. Though some may have their suspicions, these virtues are not eclipsed by those who had ulterior motives in mind. I do have a recommendation in fact - his professionalism may have been critical to this incident, and he is praised by many as a hero who dove “into the cages” in a daring operation to liberate those trapped underground. However, this may not necessarily be a good thing for him. The officials who passed down these barbaric laws were not entirely snuffed out by the angry mobs in the clashes that followed, so I cannot guarantee that there are no survivors out there who still harbor a deep resentment. Although they no longer have any influence over the autonomous prefecture, nor can they seek to ambush the steam power-equipped mining teams of Rim Billiton, it would not be impossible for them to lie in ambush in the outskirts, waiting to attack a lone Catastrophe Messenger who travels with only one bodyguard. In fact, there have been cases of such attacks over the last two years. \nAlthough we tried to persuade this individual to stay within the city and leave the data collection to others, he was even more adamant in requesting missions that would send him away from relative safety. Perhaps he is well aware of our intentions and does not want to run the risk of getting people in the city involved. But does he really have this kind of self-destructive thinking? ...I hope he has a more optimistic outlook. You see, he is the kind of person who is always ready and willing to accept new things, and is never content to languish in the same environment for too long. In any case, entrusting him to you should be the right course of action. Take him - or perhaps, accompany him - to see the vastness of Terra, and more.” \n—Transcript of a conversation at an official residence in the Eureka Autonomous Prefecture",

So you know that Catastrophe Messengers usually require the services of their bodyguards while conducting missions, right? As for me, I’ve always had this old acquaintance with me. And his skill, I’m telling you, he could even sever the progression of Oripathy! He’d do it nice and clean too, and the equipment he carried on him was... Eh? Hey, what are you doing?

We speculate that this is among the reasons why he is highly sought after by mining companies. After analyzing data gathered by our equipment, we determined the Leonhardt was able to skillfully use his Arts to locate and finely separate the structure of the same kind of sand or metal within a range, accomplishing this by attacking the particles with high-speed bursts of debris.",

Though the desire to explore the frozen tundra was her own, the core reason she undertook her exploration had a great deal to do with Rhine Lab. Additionally, Magallan’s exploration was better planned and thoroughly measured. \nOn the other hand, Asbestos’s exploration is completely amateur - nobody asked her to do it, and nobody is backing her financially. She merely follows her own ideas, walking around and recording her observations in her travel notes and publishing them in magazines. \nIn fact, almost all active explorers on Terra are affiliated with either some country or company, such as Magallan is, and explorers with no backing, such as Asbestos, are very rare. Realistically speaking, a desire to explore the world cannot be fulfilled solely through courage, but requires capital as well. \nThough Asbestos is reluctant to reveal her background, we can surmise that there’s likely nothing exceedingly bad or traumatic. As for why she decided to become a maverick explorer, Rhodes Island does not intend to pry too much. That is to say, on this point, she differs greatly from Magallan. \nAs for the differences in their views on exploration, Asbestos claims that she’s just “in it for the excitement.” While it is true that when we mention explorers, we often have an impression of them as being pioneers, trailblazers, delvers into the unknown, or torchbearers for those who come after them, etc., none of these are substantively different. \n“Opening the way for those in the future” is generally the result rather than the cause. For example, while Magallan has always wanted to be an explorer, that desire fundamentally stems from her longing for the frozen tundra. Rather, those who try to act out of one of these clichéd ideals of righteousness usually end up giving up halfway through. \nFrom the footprints that Asbestos has left and the records she has taken, there is no doubt that she is an excellent explorer.",

As a matter of fact, she even revels in that animus, especially when people say it to her face. She understands that the true way to alienate others is not to rudely refuse, but rather to be calculatingly evasive, or to be ambivalent. \nRather than saying she doesn’t understand interpersonal relationships, it’s more accurate to say that she sees them far too thoroughly and hasn’t chosen not to maintain certain norms after recognizing all of this. \nLike Magallan, she knows how to endure loneliness, but a major difference is, one of Magallan’s greatest motivating factors is the fact that someone is waiting for her. Asbestos, however, has no need for such motivation, nor is she trying to compensate for that with something else. She simply has learned to draw her motivation from other things. \nIt’s little wonder that some operators think she’s very cool. She’s willing to bear the consequences of her decisions, alone. \nEven though we have no way of finding out about her past without her cooperation, based upon the result, she claims to actively want to be a “jerk” that antagonizes everyone, and is intent on staying that way until the end of her life. \nIt is not for us to judge whether her lifestyle is correct, nor do we expect her to change. However, from Rhodes Island’s standpoint, we always hope that operators will be able to trust us. In this respect, Asbestos may be one of the most difficult operators we’ve ever dealt with. \nHowever, thanks to the Doctor’s persistent efforts, Asbestos is now willing to recognize Rhodes Island as the company behind her, and she has made respectable progress.",

Because she accepted this reality, there is no way to really blame her. \nOf course, the life of an explorer also facilitates her liberties in a certain sense. After all, she has very little contact with people except for those needed to refill her supplies. \nBecause Asbestos’s autonomy does not infringe upon other people, the biggest victims are probably the Doctor and certain operators who are trying to establish a good relationship with her. Therefore, Rhodes Island will continue to uphold its consistent policy of not interfering with the private lives of its operators. \nBut even if that is the case, just as she insists on living life her own way, Rhodes Island also has something it insists on - we will never let her die as she wishes.",

She is familiar with most dance styles from both Higashi and Yan, and is very experienced with the ceremonial Kagura dances. However, this is the one type of dance that she refuses to do.

This was, after all, the reason she became a Catastrophe Messenger in the first place, and is also the reason why her initial probation period was half the duration of most other operators. The operator who compiled Tsukinogi's file was originally distressed about the fact that the Doctor had been keeping secrets regarding Tsukinogi's past, but after talking with Tsukinogi, that operator has since become a firm supporter.

After entering the modern era, however, their status has been challenged by emerging business and political elites. \nIn some countries such as Columbia, the status of a well-known business is roughly equivalent to the entire lifeblood of another country, and a lesser noble is certainly not as wealthy as the general manager of a Columbian company. Many nobles who saw the writing on the walls have been trying to convert their land and possessions into financial capital. \nHowever, in more baroque countries such as Ursus, change has been slow and painful. At least before the Great Rebellion, the aristocratic ruling class still controlled the right to speech. Had it not been for a certain incident, Ursus’s political structure might not have shifted at all. \nAccording to Rosa’s description, the Rostov family she belonged to was one of the new nobility that arose after the Great Rebellion, inheriting everything from a certain Count that they had served under. \nCount Boris, the mayor of Chernobog, was also one of these upstarts. The two families quickly got on good terms, running businesses throughout Chernobog either openly or in secret. This conferred upon Rosa’s family a very high status within Chernobog’s elites. \nOf course, this all went to naught with the demise of Chernobog.",

The date coincided with the time when Mephisto began to move, in the event now known as the Chernobog incident;\nAfter seizing control of the schools, Mephisto did not interfere with the students’ actions within the schools, but would not permit them to leave. From the perspective of outside observers, he intended to exacerbate the brewing anxiety of the students. This ugly behavior is consistent with our perception of him;\nThe time Reunion relaxed their control over the schools corresponded with the time Amiya encountered Mephisto during the mission to rescue the Doctor. Amiya believes that Mephisto received information regarding Rhodes Island’s movements and left the schools unsupervised because he had already seen what he wanted to see after setting tragedy into motion;\nThe Peterheim Middle School she described does exist in Chernobog, close to the place where they were rescued, in a block not directly struck by the Catastrophe. \netc, etc. \nAfter considering various factors, we can only conclude that what Rosa described indeed occurred within an event as tragic as the Chernobog incident. \nAs for the experiences of the other members of the Self-government Group during this tragedy, Rosa said that she didn’t know much because she joined the group late, but she also made it clear that she was unwilling to speak on their behalf. Rosa will take the initiative to speak about her experiences. On one hand, this is a manifestation of her trust in Rhodes Island and in the Doctor; but on the other hand, she fears that among the members of the Self-government Group, she is the most appropriate person to “betray” the others and break the silence. She hopes that the Doctor can do the one thing she cannot - help her fellow classmates.",

When Rosa joined Rhodes Island along with the other members of the Ursus Student Self-government Group, a number of small incidents occurred. \nBecause she was an Ursus noble of pure pedigree. \nWe must confront reality: struggles over politics, economics, land, technology, and war are timeless plagues that have always been tied together by a single thread - nobility. \nAs mentioned in the second file, the old aristocrats largely disappeared from the political arena with the development of nomadic cities; but within Ursus, they did not take their exit from the stage of history. \nOf course, this hardly concerns the average person. It is absolutely impossible for a pure-blooded Ursus aristocrat who has been nurtured at length with an elite education to simply join an organization like Rhodes Island. These nobles sit atop their ivory thrones, governing wealth and land high above the reaches of suffering. \n\nAfter Rosa officially started working with the Logistics Department, she undeniably did act like she was “trying to seem less like an aristocrat.” One can tell that she is still not accustomed to lowering her position, but she is legitimately trying to adapt to such a life. \nWhy? Because a vast majority of people, Infected or non-Infected, harbor no love for nobles - and particularly not Ursus nobles. \nHowever, Rosa no longer pays any heed to the position she once came from. She bore the burden of contempt in silence, only occasionally smiling and shaking her head - however, she never let that get in the way of her work. \n“No person should be judged because of where they came from,” said Istina as she stood in front of Rosa, shielding her from an outraged Ursus operator. \nWe agree that nothing like that should never be allowed to happen in Rhodes Island, ever. The same is true for Amiya, and the same is true for that operator who later apologized to Rosa. \nRosa, her frankness, her self-reproach, her confusion... was certainly not a novel case when she joined Rhodes Island. \n\nToday is yet another day upon Terra.",

Of course this is my personal belief. Despite the unfortunate fact that Lisa was infected at such a young age, she still has such a strong and pure aspect to her that I can’t even begin to comprehend what her parents went through to shield her from that kind of environment. However, because of that, Lisa lacks some basic knowledge regarding the Infected. Perhaps we should seriously consider educating Lisa about these subjects, which may leave her feeling confused and sad. However, it would also avoid the inevitable pain and trauma that will come with her status as an Infected, at some point in the future. \nEven if we exaggerate a little bit. If Rhodes Island is unable to even guide these Infected children down the correct paths so that they can understand their destiny and choose the life that is right for them, can we really seek to break the status quo of the Infected simply through medical treatment? \nOf course, Lisa may also show us the bright future that lies ahead. That is the reason I’m so fond of her. No, it’s not just because she leaned against my shoulder to take a nap during Dr. Warfarin’s lecture.",

Suzuran’s father is a kannushi, or priest, who built a small name for himself in a certain city-state in Higashi. In light of recent situations and the vast distance between Higashi and Siracusa, it is hard to imagine how Suzuran’s parents met, fell in love, and then had their daughter, Lisa. Suzuran inherited her mother’s hair color and facial features, but she also inherited the sacred bloodline of her father, seen through her nine tails. At one point, this trait made Suzuran recognized as heir to her father’s priesthood status, but her father did not intend to allow his daughter to be shackled to the family’s endless shrine duties. While he firmly believed that what he did brought succor to the people, he clung onto selfish hopes that his daughter could have a broader, freer future. As such, Suzuran was secretly taken to Siracusa by her mother, but the peaceful times did not last long. Her mother’s family was involved in a bout of civil unrest against the ■■■■ family. During this uprising, Suzuran, who was recognized as her mother’s weak point, was injured during a certain plot when a shard of originium hidden within a stuffed doll cleanly pierced her left arm. One can imagine how remorseful Suzuran’s mother felt as a result of this incident; after entrusting Suzuran to Rhodes Island, her mother personally led an assassination attempt against the assailant’s family, and has not been heard from again since. \nAs for how we learned about these inside stories that are rarely known even inside the city-states of Siracusa... we must keep Lisa a secret.",

Yet despite that, they were able to smuggle a nine-tailed Vulpo out of the isolated Higashi, even though she was identified to be a successor.

Lisa would often burn the edges of her dress because of her poor control over her Originium Arts, trying to put up a smile in front of concerned operators. After all, not everything can be explained away by “naivete.” The success and progress she achieved was not due to either her “pedigree” or her “innate talent.” She may still be a child, but as with Amiya, do not overlook her inner fortitude. Lisa has been working hard silently, and has also been growing silently. That is a power that she has always possessed, without us needing to tell her about our ideals, the times, or the grand propositions for Terra. She does not need us to underestimate her, let alone coddle her. Let Lisa see both the beauty and cruelty of this land, and I dare say that every person who claims to want to protect Lisa will be protected by this strong child in the end.",

The people here not only helped repair her drone, but even made a few technical upgrades that she never would’ve thought about before. Now, the drone is more sensitive, sturdier, and even comes with a small amount of firepower for self-defense purposes.

              "storyText": "The heart of the Sargon desert is difficult to traverse, and even experienced Messengers find it difficult to reach the deepest portions. In Beeswax's tribe, it is not unusual for young members of the tribe to go on journeys to the outside world and bring back what they see. Because these journeys have become traditions in their own rights, this particular tribe is unlike many others in that it does not totally reject novel things from the outside. \nIn addition to these journeys, one or two veteran Messengers may visit each year at certain times to bring the latest news to clan members, including the most recent music magazines. \nBeeswax does not appear to be someone who is incredibly shrewd; rather, she is straightforward and easy to understand. She loves music as well. When she left home, she brought with her a number of magazines issued by the Music Society, and these new publications became quite popular among the Caster teams. Even Beeswax herself quick integrated, smoothly establishing good relationships with the other operators. \nThough Beeswax doesn’t talk much, is quiet most of the time, and tends to lose her train of thought, by no means is she simple-minded. In choosing to officially become an Operator of Rhodes Island, Beeswax did not rush to her decision, but had to weigh a variety of considerations. \nThe fact that she chose to stay to wait for her relative, while certainly her primary reason, is only one of several considerations. After a bit of inquiry, we determined that Beeswax believes that her time at Rhodes Island will serve as valuable experience to help her pass her tribe’s rites of passage to adulthood— or rather, she sees working with Rhodes Island as one rung of that trial. \nAfter comprehensive deliberation, we also saw no reason to deny the participation of a talented and powerful Caster. On one hand, the addition of Beeswax is beneficial to us. On the other hand, we believe that such an option will help Beeswax as well, and Rhodes Island will be able to provide her with many further opportunities to understand this land. \n\nAs an addendum, the young Caprinae waited for several months before picking out her official code name. After writing to her hometown for help, she finally decided on the name she now uses.",

Among them, some ancient tribes lack means of communicating with the outside world, and often retain their unique customs and traditions. Although the Caprinae tribe to which Beeswax belongs does not fall under this category, it still retains its customs despite regular contact with the outside world. \nThough many view the so-called “pagan” beliefs of these tribes as little more than barbaric vestiges of a primitive legacy, there are a few researchers who have been trying to ascertain the true source of these ancient beliefs. \nOperator Beeswax is not shy about sharing her beliefs. From her descriptions, she tends to use more abstract expressions, trying to depict a conceptual existence rather than a physical object of worship with an actual image. In fact, even though Beeswax claimed to have received the blessings of the gods, she admitted that she had frankly never directly seen these gods.",

Therefore, it is totally understandable that she would trust her work partner more than others. \nHowever, Closure said one day that “it’s better to have someone who can talk with you,” and before Scene could refuse, Closure transformed Lens into a talking photography assistant. \nAccording to Closure, Lens stands out from the crowd. “It contains the previous generation of Raythean Industries’ auxiliary AI. All I did was give the little guy a way to express itself. There’s nothing wrong with it becoming Scene’s friend. After all, nobody else can understand what Scene is thinking. What is Raythean Industries doing anyway? Even if they’ve been pushed out of their own field, you can’t just go around selling off stuff like this. In any case, this thing is very, very rare.” \n\nBecause of this, many people believe that Lens’s habit of long-windedness actually comes from Closure. Operators have occasionally reported seeing Lens communicating with Lancet-2 in the hallway, but could not figure out what the whirring and buzzing was all about. Perhaps its built-in thinking loop actually functions like this, but this quality was put on full display after the installation of a sound device. As for what goes on in the little brain of a robot, sometimes not even the owner knows. \nDo you think that Miss Scene is ever troubled by... what happened to her old partner? \nAt least up until this point, I haven’t received any requests from her to uninstall the sound device.",

Even though she was born into a noble family in Sargon, Scene has hardly attained recognition from anyone, let alone the upper crust. \nOf course, and this may be for other reasons, Scene seems to have been born with a natural insensitivity and was never put down by the harsh words of others. Even more fortunately, she found a job that she loved — Photography. \nVery quickly, Scene amassed her own fame and wealth, along with everything else that came with it. However, she remains silent and, other than occasionally taking pictures of high-ranking officials, prefers to do her work away from the commotion of crowded areas. \nWhile it is true that her shyness, almost “mechanical” movements, and her statue-like postures when stationary have brought about social difficulties, these qualities have also been immense assets towards her photography career that ordinary people simply do not have. \nFurthermore, if you are fortunate enough to see Scene working on her own robotic camera team, you might think that her usual behavior is just a result of not liking to expend energy.",

All we know is that she continued to stay there, weaving a masterful tale about the unfolding of a Catastrophe with her camera. \nRegardless of what happened, at least Scene survived. \nAfter Scene contracted Oripathy, her parents consulted several medical organizations and finally decided to send her to Rhodes Island for treatment; however, they’ve never contacted their daughter since then. In the face of the somewhat complicated political situation in Sargon, this kind of decision seems almost natural to some operators. \nScene herself also doesn’t seem to mind. Or if she does, she hasn’t told anyone. It didn’t take long before she started to apply for the qualifications to work in the field, and even wanted to accompany operators to the battlefield in order to shoot more images. This means that Scene may be involved in battle, and possibly even lose her life. \nBut she didn’t let that dissuade her. Lens is very proud to say that the places they’ve been to have been far worse than what people in Rhodes Island can imagine, and the dangers they’ve encountered are far more terrifying than what they now are dealing with. \nWhile Scene may have already honed her skills and be able to calmly face the doubts of others, another interpretation is that she might just be very dedicated to her trade. She believes that through her eyes and her lens, she can help others like herself who are more sensitive to images than they are words see more and more of the world. \nScene very rarely says anything, but she did speak once with her dorm mates when discussing her family. She said, she believes that her partner, Lens, is her closest family member. \nAlso, she said that she believes in her parents.

As long as you’ll go do it, we will support you.” \nEven though Scene doesn’t express it, she may perhaps be very happy now. \nBy the way, how did Closure manage to get a sample of Scene’s voice to build Lens’s audio library?! \n......\nWhat? Does Scene use Lens to speak for her sometimes? \nWell, how are we supposed to know? It’s talking to me right now.\nIs that Lens\nOr is it actually Scene talking? \nWanna bet on it? \nSure......",

Due to the operating mode of the weapon itself, we’ve temporarily named it “RT-01.” \nSince there is no weapon or even weapon class similar to RT-01 within our scope of knowledge, we believe that this is an experimental weapon. According to Ayerscape, this weapon was purchased from Rim Billiton’s black market. Rim Billiton has developed many small-scale private mining companies due to its robust mining industry. The turnover and conglomeration rate among these companies are high, which indirectly promotes the black market. Many resources will circulate here before eventually reaching the hands of private individuals, organizations, or even foreign forces. Because Ayerscarpe overcame great difficulties to acquire this weapon, and the weapon itself boasts excellent performance, he is extremely fond of RT-01.

All in all, Leonhard, not wealthy in the first place, ended up allocating most of his salary to Ayerscarpe, ending up in an even tighter financial situation as a result. \nAlthough we didn’t know how Ayerscarpe controlled these funds before, we were able to investigate the flow of funds between the two after he became an operator, and the results were mind-blowing. \nLeonhardt’s concept of managing money is rather laissez-faire. While he is good at making money, he’s also good at spending it. After joining Rhodes Island, his shopping list grew longer than ever due to stable living arrangements and a higher salary. Except for work-related tools such as dune buggies, which have questionable usability in general circumstances, Leonhardt’s stash of new and interesting things has indeed been growing. Most of these items simply reflect his personal taste, but others are for gifting to young operators who he deems to “not be cool enough,” and he often offers these gifts in a way that is hard to refuse. Sometimes, his consumption habits have caused been problematic, such as when he couldn’t pay the bills one time. This time, he has had Ayerscarpe to cover for him.\nAyerscarpe’s lifestyle has always been very frugal. Other than spending money on necessary living expenses and salted edamame, Ayerscarpe has been saving his money, and he basically returns the “payment” he received from serving as Leonhardt’s bodyguard to his friend at the right time. He knows that Leonhardt doesn’t know how to save money, and he knows that sooner or later, he wouldn’t be able to purchase something that he actually needed. At that time, he’ll use that money to buy things for his friend and send it over to him. Even now when there is no direct financial connection between the two, he still often draws from his savings to fill in the gap for Leonhardt. Of course, he also knows that Leonhardt will repay him in due time. This is the mutual understanding formed after many years of cooperation, and demonstrates the trust between the two friends.",

I can tell just from looking at it.” \n“The signal’s final destination is a port located in Ursus.” \n“After being intercepted by a node halfway through, it modified the target port before immediately deleting the data. This is an old trick.” \n“Do you really think Ursus knows how to make a weapon like this?” \n“A reloading blade-gun, a self-calibrating gun, automatic hover blades.” \n“Only Rhine Labs has the capacity to deliberately integrate these technologies into a single system.” \n“I see.” \n“So——”\n“How did a Columbian experimental weapon end up in Rim Billiton, in the hands of a young man who has nothing to do with them?” \n“......”\nThis whole situation has Rhine Lab's fingerprints all over it.

There’s no need for that. Saria couldn’t see eye-to-eye about the way certain departments in Rhine Lab did things, but she wouldn’t do anything about these weapon owners.” \n“Our biggest fear is that Rhine Lab will use the signal transmitter to take control of the device and do something unspeakable.” \n“Since we found out about it, it should be fine now that we’ve destroyed it.” \n“As for what Rhine Lab will do with the data they obtained, will they find another target to experiment upon, or will they create the hatchet that can slay a god?” \n“So, what does this have to do with Rhodes Island?” \n—Unknown time, Rhodes Island, unidentified surveillance recording",

Though she had an interest in hunting and was capable of conducting a hunt in the wild and returning safely, she still had too much to learn as a combat operator. After the Chernobog incident, Folinic made a request to Kal'tsit in hopes that she could make the preparations to transition into a combat operator as quickly as possible, or at least, that Kal'tsit would allow her to join the battlefield as a combat medic or provisional physician. After Folinic took her physical fitness evaluation, Kal'tsit agreed to her request and had Folinic join the reserve operator training camp, where she trained with the other reserve operators. After half a year, Folinic completed her preparatory training and officially joined Rhodes Island’s outpost operation team. Folinic considered many ways she could offer her support; she could try to become a sniper, or she could balance her work as a medic and guard; but in the end, she decided to become a combat medic and continue to prioritize medical assistance. However, in her half-year of combat training, she realized that most medics were quite frail and had no combat capabilities once they lost the protection of their comrades. To overcome this, Folinic used her pharmacological knowledge to carefully formulate a number of reagents commonly found in readily-available drugs to treat external injuries. With minor modifications such as increasing the dosage or mixing in different compounds, these drugs could become potent toxins that could incapacitate targets in a very short time. She has stepped out onto the battlefield many times and incapacitated many enemies. We don’t know how she feels about her new role as someone who is supposed to do no harm, but when she’s facing an enemy, her anger is evident enough to anyone who sees her.",

After she followed her mother to Chernobog due to her job, Folinic naively thought that she was about to enjoy a better life. After all, her life was secure, she had met many people and among them, many were willing to reach out to her or teach her. Kal'tsit was one of those people. Subsequently, she said to her mother on just another ordinary day, “I’ll wait until you’re back to cook dinner.” But on that day, everything disappeared - her family and her friends, all gone without a trace. Only Kal'tsit, her mentor and the woman who would effectively become her only relative, rescued her from peril and entrusted her to an ordinary family in Chernobog. From sparse evidence and clues, Folinic pieced together the real cause of her mother’s death - Ursus. From that point on, she began to dig deeper, to learn, recognize, understand, and internalize every aspect of what kind of country Ursus is, and each bit of knowledge only further fanned the flames of her anger. Finally, right before Reunion made their move when Folinic was about to finish her studies, she met with Kal'tsit once more and expressed her desire to follow her. Even though Folinic was grateful towards her adoptive parents, she realized that she could never forgive the Ursus Empire to the point where she did not want to spend another second within its confines. Now, if she could call any place home, she would definitely say:\n“My home will always be wherever Dr. Kal'tsit is. ”",

After spending more time together, everyone gradually realized that though the Iberian swordsman may seem cold in demeanor and speak in a blunt manner, his actual nature was rather straightforward, free-spirited and suave, though not overblown. \nThe swordsman seems to be aware of the issues some may have with his blunt and easily-misunderstood way of speaking, but he isn’t particularly bothered by this. For Thorns, others’ perceptions of him are ultimately inconsequential, and the way the outside world evaluates him has no effect upon him. \n\nThorns often delves deeply into the extraction and preparation of medicinals and ends up ignoring other things in the process — such as his own outward appearance. Forgetting to wear a jacket, having one trouser leg rolled up, wearing clothes with holes in them, and even wearing things backwards or insides out — all of these are commonplace occurrences. If you encounter Thorns in the hallway displaying one of these features, don’t read too much into it. \nFor a swordsman who pursues precision and efficiency, it isn’t worthwhile to spend too much time maintaining one’s appearance. Even if Thorns’ hair puffs up and curls over because of an awry experiment gone explosive, Thorns continues to conduct his own business, withstanding the curious eyes of all bystanders without a care.",

This swift and precise technique is widely known throughout Iberia as the “Supreme Arts.” \nThe mainstay weapons of the Iberian region have always been swords and knives, with a wide variety of techniques spread across the land. However, the technique known as the “Supreme Arts” is not accessible to everyone. \nNeedless to say, this technique requires excellent physical fitness, but it also has extremely demanding requirements for the user’s mind. These strict requirements make the technique very difficult to learn, but if mastered, the rewards are great. \nAt the same time, many traditional Iberian blademasters believe that “Supreme Arts” can only be used to describe swordsmanship using a standardized subset of weapons; and in their eyes, the styles used by non-Liberis, including Thorns, are nothing but clumsy and blasphemous imitations. However, according to Thorns, those people have absorbed more than enough of the technique’s framework and apply them in a more realistic manner. On this basis, there are no issues with considering them as users of “Supreme Arts.” In other words, people who fight over semantics will quickly perish when they have to actually cross swords. After, they would not be exclusively facing swordsmen. \n\nHowever, even these renegade swordsmen will readily admit that Iberian swordsmanship is as vast and as dangerous as the ocean. No swordsman may ever exhaust that knowledge within his lifetime; not to mention, that lifetime is generally very short as well. \n\nIn any case, by combining the precise swordsmanship he has mastered with the deadly poisons he concocted himself, Thorns will always complete his missions upon the battlefield with efficiency and ease, ensuring optimal results while keeping losses minimal. \nHis method of operating is beyond reproach in terms of efficiency; however, in many situations, Thorns himself ends up garnering criticism. \nThorns’ swordsmanship and his pharmacological knowledge were learned from a local priest. He and several other children studied under the priest, following him through childhood and adolescence. Because this priest became involved in the religious turmoil that would later break out, several of his students have taken divergent paths. \nThorns is exceptionally skilled at swordsmanship, and also exhibits extraordinary talents in pharmacology. He is particularly skilled at extracting and purifying drug compounds, especially toxins. The precise efficacy of some of the neurotoxins he’s produced has been praised by the members of the Medical Department. In addition, Thorns always has bolder ideas when it comes to refining other reagents; and while his experiments do sometimes yield positive results, they end with an explosion more often than not. \nEven in the face of failure, Thorns always seems to enjoy himself.",

An operator’s profile overview can only be completed by synthesizing all of the available information. \nOf course, through the course of these investigations, we’ve noticed that the personalities of the operators who come to Rhodes Island are almost always complex and multifaceted, almost impossible to reduce down to a list of simple traits, and of course, never exactly the same between two operators. \nMany people who’ve been in contact with Thorns will describe him as “difficult to get along with.” While these evaluations seem to reflect poorly upon him, further investigation revealed that many of the operators who gave him these negative evaluations still maintain frequent and friendly interactions with him. The fact that so many people can see his flaws, on the contrary, only shows that he has more numerous and deeper relationships than most. \nWhile people complain that Thorns is “difficult to get along with,” they still make the effort to do so. In regards to the issue of Thorns’ interpersonal relationship with other operators, we concluded that there is no need for further monitoring. \n\n[Addendum] \nI agree that long-term observation can enhance our understanding of an operator. \nBut to be honest, I originally thought he was kind of cool, but within a few months, all I could think of was him and his.... uh... how should I put this... lively friends doing all kinds of weird exercises together at the gym. They’d talk about wacky topics all day long, but then they’d actually go sparring with real weapons and make all sorts of weird motions. Sometimes, they’d explode and start fighting before even doing anything! Who’s going to be able to keep an eye on a guy like that? How come no one has come to hang these people on deck yet? \n\n[Recorder’s Addendum] \nWe all ready tried that, but it didn’t do anything. \nThe investigation period ends today. I have some comments I’d like to write on this file, but my boss said they were too subjective, so nevermind. What I will say is, the potion bang snaps they made today were a lot of fun.",

Occasionally, when you mention their homeland, even Iberians who are generally impassive or stony-faced will show some complex expressions, and these subtle nuances can reveal a lot about their attitudes. \nThorns is one of the few people among us who actually will give an unreserved impression of Iberia. Compared with the silence or vague remarks of the other operators, Thorns actually can give a calm response to our inquiries. He’s provided us with a lot of referential information, and while a lot of it is fairly similar to more mainstream conceptions, some of it completely subverts these notions. \nIn the past, this seaside country was often associated with passion, vitality, indulgence, where sunshine melts into the coast along the horizon.

However, in recent years, this rich land has gradually become silent and faded from the public eye. [Classified Log] Very little is known about the current state of Iberia. According to Thorns, the treatment of the Ægir in Iberia has gone from bad to worse over the past few decades. He described a once prosperous city as gloomy and stagnant. \nThe local administrators do not seem to prohibit locals from leaving, but they have enacted tight restrictions on re-entry.

After all, Blacksteel’s guns are assumed to be some kind of corporate secret, but a non-Laterano freelance mercenary strutting around with a huge gun gets people talking. \nOf course, everything becomes clear once you see her shoot an inkball out of that thing. Apparently, it’s a modified crossbow made to look like a gun. Because Andreana is a committed firearms enthusiast. \nAccording to her, Laterano culture has had a strong influence on the Iberians, who often display an affection for it. After seeing one of the statues in church as a child, Andreana fell in love with the weapons, and devoted herself to mechanical engineering in hopes of making a crossbow in the style of a gun, since she lacks the affinity for Originium Arts necessary to use a real one herself. \nBut there is a point here worth examining, and one Andreana herself did not realize. She mentioned that she was dragged into court over the weapon several times, only to be chastised when it became clear it was not a real gun. That seems reasonable. But with the limited information we have, the Iberian courts should be very powerful. And for such an organization to grab her “several times” for something known to be harmless the first time indicates that they may have been using it as a pretense to find something else. \nHowever, since we lack reliable intelligence about the internal politics of a country closed so long to outsiders, we are not able to form any concrete judgments about the situation. And since, at least according to Andreana herself, she has not been harmed or unnecessarily interrogated, we leave the matter to speculation.",

We were only able to conclude, once again, that she is a lot stronger overall than the average person. To use Dr. Warfarin’s phrasing, “What the hell? At this level, we can’t compare her to Skadi’s physique at all.” While there is some ambiguity in that statement, it is true that when compared to Skadi, Andreana’s physical prowess could well be explained by better physical development. There are always those who are naturally strong. Let’s just say that making her a Sniper Operator may be a bit beneath her. But Rhodes Island won’t interfere with her personal choice. \nAll in all, after confirming no anomalies in her physical condition, the matter has been closed. But, to be on the safe side, Medical still recommends Andreana receive regular checkups.",

And thanks to his appearance, as well as his skills with a knife, he was often mistaken for a triad. And since the “triads” of the Lungmen slums often keep a low profile, mixing in with ordinary folk and setting up front businesses, suspicion fell on Jaye. The misunderstandings and misconceptions piled on top of each other, giving Jaye a reputation as a dangerous man, not to be messed with. Some rumors even labeled him the true puppetmaster behind several different gangs. \nBut really, Jaye just wanted to sell his seafood. He’d haul his goods to market, and sometimes help out at the finball shop.  The rumors weighed heavily on Jaye. But there was nothing he could do about them.",
