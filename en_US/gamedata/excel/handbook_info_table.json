The current, most reliable information comes from Silence's own writings about her experiences as well as other aspects of her life. \nAccording to her recollection, Silence's relationship with Rhine Lab and Originium began during her days as a student, when she accompanied her mentor to the company. \nAt that time, Rhine Lab was holding a scientific exhibition to show off the results of its research from a tour of Columbia. The new medical equipment she saw optimized Originium transmission efficiency based upon new results obtained from live trials, making possible a whole new generation of dazzling treatments. \nAfter completing her studies, Silence's wish came true and she was allowed to join Rhine Lab as an employee. She had an extraordinary talent for Originium Arts, and soon got the opportunity to participate in several experimental projects related to important Originium technology and clinical treatment. \nBut as well as her career was going, and as much as the upper levels of the company recognized her achievements, Silence never forgot her original dream - to join the Originium Technology and Life Science Applications project. \n\n\"I never thought the opportunity would come so soon.\" \nLooking back on this time, Silence let slip a sly smile.",

It was not fitted with a weapon, instead its only designated function was to provide timely treatment for Operators on the battlefield. \nMedicine that has undergone several rounds of testing by the Rhodes Island Pharmaceutical Team can be assembled into the drone's kits in a variety of ways. The drone can use aerosolized medicine, it can spray, it can inject, and it can simulate a medic's treatment wand. It can switch between these modes depending on the needs of the terrain and the environment, and the specific situation of the Operator in need of healing. \nHowever, this medical drone is still in its experimental stages. Because it needs to be lightweight and convenient, it needs to be a kind of throwaway and relatively fragile low-value target. Additionally, in areas with strong signal interference and complex terrain, its efficiency will be affected to a certain degree. \nEven so, it still provides Rhodes Island Operators with quality treatment. Better still, this is only the first gift that Silence has brought to Rhodes Island.",

Judging by Ifrit's current symptoms, we can at least tell that the treatment was unsuccessful.\nAs one of the Rhodes Island medical team's more demanding patients, Ifrit primarily receives care from Silence. This is consistent with information currently available from their time at Rhine Lab. Even after coming to Rhodes Island, the two have maintained the close relationship they built when they were both at the other company. \nIn terms of personality, Ifrit is a bit... immature. She acts like a 6-10 year old and is rebellious, impetuous, overconfident most of the time, even bordering on egotistical. She is extremely impulsive, ready to act the second an idea pops into her mind, no matter how dangerous it might be.\nOn the other hand, the outstanding form her Originium Arts take must be supported. Rhine Lab even created a flame-casting wand device to complement her talent. This gift pushed Ifrit to show off her abilities with even more bombast. \nIn short, after daily observation, we can say that Ifrit is someone who easily gets caught up in her emotions. For now, she doesn't have the ability to distinguish between right and wrong, and she's quite immature. In an extreme environment such as a battlefield, her instincts push her to fight against and even annihilate all those who get in her way. As a result, even if she never intended to do so, she has saved many lives.",

However, the structure of her horns and her tail are quite different from typical Sarkaz. Even though current research on the Sarkaz and their traits is incomplete, at least compared to the other Sarkaz present at Rhodes Island, Ifrit's characteristics are quite unique. \nThe Sarkaz race maintains particular talent for Originium Arts, and Ifrit's talent far exceeds that of most Sarkaz. \nAccording to these observations, it is probable that Ifrit's racial characteristics have undergone some superficial changes triggered by her Oripathy. It's also possible that the Originium presence in her circulatory system is interfering with test results. These changes are irreversible and have proven an unexpected obstacle to the medical team's investigation: they are unable to determine which type of Sarkaz Ifrit is. \nIn addition, Ifrit's medical records show that she suffers from chronic nerve pain and even occasional hallucinations. Records describe these hallucinations as enormous apparitions that are tremendously painful for her, or depictions of charred corpses and immolated animals, or close personal relations consumed by a sea of agonizing fire. The causes of these apparitions have proven elusive to all medical and mechanical analyses. It is possible that this ongoing torment is the source of her irascible character. \nIn summary, Ifrit is an Operator that needs close monitoring, even by Rhodes Island standards. Anyone who comes into contact with Ifrit should have a full understanding of all this Operator's basic information before their exchange takes place.\n[Classified Log]\nThis record exists because Ifrit's physiological structure has already become quite peculiar. \nShe was a Sarkaz, but whether she is still indeed Sarkaz, I am unsure...

This has meant that the people of Kjerag have not needed to rely on nomadic cities to live and work. Of course, the steep terrain has also slowed Kjerag's development considerably. \nThe name of the Karlan Trade Company is probably derived from the name of the holy mountain the believers of Kjerag worship. \nThe trade company, run by SilverAsh, is the only window to the outside world for the insular and conservative nation of Kjerag. At the same time, this company has unavoidably changed the country. \nIt would be wise for Rhodes Island to research SilverAsh's record, given this level of power and vision.",

LTD, is a controversial figure at Rhodes Island. \nWhatever the case, the other Operators have come to a consensus: SilverAsh is not an Operator who can be easily dispatched or controlled. \nSilverAsh and his employees work very closely with Rhodes Island, but there is no hierarchical relationship between them. \nWhether it is strategic planning or tactical command, many Operators find SilverAsh's prowess convincing. However, the more skeptical Operators familiar with political conspiracy and such machinations are wary of SilverAsh's intentions. \nAlthough SilverAsh truly cares about his younger sister, Cliffheart, who is being treated at Rhodes Island, he trusts Rhodes Island no more than Rhodes Island trusts him. \nPerhaps as the rumor says, what is really of interest to SilverAsh is the value of Rhodes Island Pharmaceuticals itself, as well as the Doctor he regards as a competent rival... \n Dr. Kal'tsit is opposed to trying to make any further contact with SilverAsh.

Despite the ruling, evidence at the scene pointed to foul play by political enemies of the Silverash clan. Perhaps because of the rapid decline of the Silverash Family, this matter was left unsettled. \nNaturally, the incident had a huge effect on young SilverAsh's life. But as SilverAsh was the scion of a wealthy family and not a weakling by any means, he never sank into despair, and even kept raising his two younger sisters until they were old enough to take care of themselves. \nThereafter, SilverAsh left Kjerag and headed to Victoria to receive a modern education, and let the Silverash family's political enemies divide up their legacy amongst themselves. The Three House Parliament of Kjerag was three houses in name only. \nThis state of affairs lasted until SilverAsh returned back to Kjerag. Upon his homecoming, the young master took upon himself the weighty responsibility of rebuilding his clan. \nNow according to Cliffheart's testimony, the SilverAsh who had returned was no longer the gentle and precocious youngster he used to be, who would grit his teeth and bear all that the world threw at him. \nThereafter, the Karlan Trade Company quickly rose to seize a monopoly in a large number of modern industries that had previously been banned in Kjerag. He exported goods and raw materials to other countries and imported modern industrial products. In doing so, he accumulated a vast amount of wealth in a very short time, and the success of his company restored the Silverash Family name to its position in the parliament. \nIn what may have been a series of plays by rival clans, SilverAsh's two younger sisters each suffered a turn of fortune that would have a huge impact on the Silverash family: Pramanix was christened a Karlan Saintess in a religious ritual, and Cliffheart was infected with Oripathy. \nRhodes Island tends to believe that these were acts of political opposition, but Cliffheart thinks that these events merely once again catalyzed SilverAsh's resolve. \nNow, no one knows what SilverAsh will do, just as no one knows the purpose behind his collaboration with Rhodes Island.",

The conflict between the Kjerag conservative faction and the reformist party have gotten more and more intense.\nOn the surface, the Karlan Trade Company is only concerned with foreign trade. However, its true owner is none other than Enciodes Silverash, head of the Silverash Family and opponent of the two conservative houses in the country's parliament.\nYou may also know him as SilverAsh, brother of Rhodes Island Operator Cliffheart.\nI am convinced that the Karlan Trade Company doesn't pay a cent to the government of Kjerag. It isn't a state-owned enterprise! Its operations and business are controlled entirely by SilverAsh himself!\nModern military equipment has passed from Raythean's hands, through the Karlan Trade Company's channels, and into Kjerag. The conservative faction doesn't even have any means of tracing the whereabouts of the goods.\nThe trade route has already been moved to the foot of the holy mountain, Karlan. The Vine-Bear Court has already used SilverAsh's sister, Saint Pramanix, as leverage to try to get the Silverash family to leave the Three House Parliament and hand over control of the valley and mining sites.\nThe troops the Karlan Trade Company sent to the training camps have already returned from Ascarat County in Victoria. Where are they now? The conservative Kjerag guards don't have any idea.\nSo what does Kjerag need most right now? We are reaching a boiling point here.

Just the tiniest little push...\nThe avalanche will bury all of Kjerag, including all of its conspiracies and all of the matters of the past.\n\nI admit that perhaps the Karlan Trade Company isn't hiding anything dangerous.\nEven so, should we really put ourselves in danger just because Cliffheart received a secret letter?\nAt the very least, Rhodes Island as a whole should not assume this magnitude of risk.\n\n--Dobermann, at the meeting 12 days before the incident at the mountain.",

The official contract is too long and complicated to go into here, though it could probably be summed up in three clauses: \nOne, Penguin Logistics is responsible for Sora's personal safety, and must not let her make any appearance that would damage her image as a pop idol. \nTwo, wherever Sora goes on a mission, Penguin Logistics is obligated to do their best to promote her and increase her popularity as they see fit, as well as absorbing all costs incurred. \nThree, including events or activities described in Clause 2, all revenue derived from Sora's performance as an entertainer must go to the management agency. \nViolation of any clause is ground for the agency to terminate the contract to revoke Sora as an Operator. \nFollowing PL's partnership with Rhodes Island, the latter also assumed all the obligations.

It is very easy to overlook her light gear and weapons, leading to a gross underestimation of her combat prowess. \nOn the other hand, the close-up melee style she prefers also can put her in peril.

Her parents worked at William University, her father a graduate professor for the School of Originium, her mother an environmental and ecological research specialist. The couple died in a volcanic eruption during a survey. \nEyjafjalla's parents had begun a project to study natural Catastrophes on Terra, and the volcano was a key site. Among the files Eyjafjalla took with her to Rhodes Island, she treasured the report on that volcano most of all. She didn't want the study to end with the passing of her parents, so she decided to continue it in their stead. \nVolcanic research must be done on-site before eruption and required long-term close-range observation. Particles with Originium components tended to be common in volcanic areas, and cooling lava constantly turned over new Originium veins, making the region a breeding ground for Oripathy. This is believed to be the reason for Eyjafjalla's infection.",

By further analyzing these data, Deepcolor can summarize her subjects' private information that most intelligence operatives would need long periods of observation to acquire, such as lifestyle choices and daily habits. \nAccording to Deepcolor's personal account, this is nothing but a basic skill possessed by all painters, and she is still at the shoal of the sea of art.\nNote 1: The sea she describes and the \"Deep\" in her code name are strange concepts for some Operators. Please see it as \"boundless water.\"\nNote 2: After rejecting Deepcolor's request to paint a portrait of the creator of this file, the profiler still received a sketch from her.",

Her combat style isn't exactly orthodox--air-painting is not a known Artcasting method, nor is it easy to comprehend. \nFurthermore, perhaps most difficult to understand are the creatures she commands, dubbed \"helpers\" (or \"tentacles\" by nosy Operators). The reason these long, thin threads are called \"creatures\" is because they possess the intelligence and mobility of a pet trained to follow orders, greatly adding to Deepcolor's combat flexibility. After comparisons to the \"Meeboos\" created by Mayer of the Rijn Life Research Center, these creatures are actually mechanical entities defying any existing classification. They have spindly bodies without noses, mouths, or ears. \nAccording to Deepcolor's own reports, these creatures were captured by her father somewhere in faraway Sargon as a gift to her. She summed up the \"helpers\" as merely \"as yet unclassified creatures.\"",

Most of the lances were left to collect dust in the storehouse. Even though Vigna had enough cash for a better weapon, she saw the lance in the corner and right off the bat knew she had to have it. \nWielding the lance requires great strength and skill, so Vigna doubled her daily training regimen. And to improve the power of the lance, she contacted the original manufacturer and custom-ordered a new model in pursuit of the perfect build. \nAfter her modifications, her lance is now a light, keen, durable, and powerful weapon. Vigna herself has also stepped up her own personal combat training in order to improve her mastery over the unique tool. \nVigna has never felt she could or would ever quit.

That earned her a personal invite from Wei Yenwu, Chief Executive of Lungmen, as well as headlines in all the newspapers. \nWith Wei's and the L.G.D's support, Shaw was accepted into Rhodes Island for her expertise in fire safety and prevention. It was an obvious boon to the island, since most Operators have little to no knowledge of or training in firefighting. Shaw handily filled the gap. \nWhen Shaw had the chance to inspect the intricate passageways and firefighting equipment on the island, and after meeting certain Operators who wield fire Arts at will, she realized she faced a daunting task.",

The first seminar commenced with the notable absence of Dr. Kal'tsit, where Shaw presented materials and slides (including various scenes of major fires and warning signs). The presentation was short, thanks to Shaw's famously fast rate of speech, and the raucous applause made it clear the audience had no clue what she had intended to communicate to them.

It's beside the point, but that team was the prototype for the Guard Department's Special Inspection Unit. There were a lot of tabloids and novels written about them. \nAnyway, they pulled it off. The ringleader was executed and most of his accomplices were killed on the spot. \nThe hostage? She was just a little girl. The kidnappers clearly didn't think about how traumatic the experience would be for her. \nShe didn't end up seeing anything gruesome. She saw a Lungmen police officer rushing out. She saw the heavy Christmas snowfall. She saw the street lamps and the Christmas tree outside the abandoned building.

Using Originium for too long tires her out. After discussion with the tech staff, it was decided Ch'en lacked the necessary conduit to control her Originium power. Without one, Ch'en could never master it. \n\nI saw her test results. The thinner the staff, the better she is at assimilation. But what's the point?

After returning to Lungmen, she almost immediately joined the Guard Department. \nNo one knows anything about her life prior to enrolling in the L.G.D. School, and no one questions her ability, dedication, or hatred of her enemies. Police officers working with Ch'en often complained about her demeanor--too strict and too harsh. Everyone thought that this harsh character would disappear in the struggle for power, and she would soften up after being worn down by endless incidents. \nSurprisingly, both crime and casualty rates have declined in the past two years, and the younger generation of officers began being promoted faster and more substantively. Ch'en was promoted and joined one of the most important teams in the Department, the Special Inspection Unit. \nMembers of this unit are generally not allowed to serve more than two years - to protect their lives and reduce their stress. Perhaps this position isn't suitable to serve for a long time: old inspectors' careers always seem to end with heroic sacrifice. \nCh'en did not retreat. She doesn't even know how to back down. \nShe became the fastest promoted officer in the history of the Lungmen police force, and also the youngest Special Inspector in the Department. Those who ridiculed her were impressed by her perseverance. After all, planning for the future is one thing. Planning every day is another. \nWhy was she so hard? Why live life this way? No one can could understand. \nThere are often small pieces of paper that have been ripped apart or angrily crumbled in Ch'en's trash bin.",
