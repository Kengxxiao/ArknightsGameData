      "uniEquipDesc": "'First expedition to the endless tundra, 25 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI just dug a tree branch out of the snow.\nThe exact data is in the data sheets, but to briefly describe it, I guess it's about as long as my arm.\nI can conclude it went through a really long petrification process. The one I'm holding must have had 90% of its original volume dissolved away before its petrification.\nWhen you think of it this way, it must have been a very big chunk of wood!\nI guess... it was probably as thick as the trunk of that tree the other day?\nIn that case, maybe the whole tree was as big as the Rhine Lab headquarters building!\nWhoa, that's amazing!\nIt doesn't seem very heavy; I'll try to take it back whole. I only hope that the Ursus police at the border aren't too hard on me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 28 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking shelter from the snowstorm outside. It doesn't look like I'll get anywhere today, so I'll stay here and try to rest up.\nI'm all out of drones, too. If I'd kept to the plan, I would've gone back as soon as I lost one of my drones.\nIn normal circumstances, I should have theoretically been able to last a month and a half in the tundra, but the situation here is way too brutal. A month is about as long as I can make it...\nIf I don't find anything once the snowstorm calms down a little, I'll—\nHey, you guys know what I found?!\nA field of flowers right inside the cave!\nThese plants get their water and nutrients from the ice here. They don't grow very tall, but they look like they're doing very well.\nI am taking an entire plant back in a culturing jar. I'll do some preliminary analysis back at the research station, and then bring it back to Rhine Lab.\nI'll try to keep going for two more days once the storm is over, then I'll go back.\nIf I act on impulse again, it might end up killing me.\n\nSecond expedition to the endless tundra, 30 days from the closest research station on foot:\nThere is an entire block of Originium ice crystal standing in front of me. Could be three times as tall as me!\nIt's a whole diamond shaped block, so if it wasn't for the snowstorm here, it'd be reflecting light in all directions. That'd look so cool!\nIt's a shame to just let it sit here among the pile of rocks and snow.\nI've marked down its rough location and taken a picture. I hope I'll be able to find it again next time by following the locator beacon.\nGiven the implications of the crystal being in one intact piece, I couldn't possibly have taken any samples from it. Thankfully, there are more than enough shards lying around that I can bring back to analyze. They'll last me a whole year.\nThat's the expedition's objective accomplished. Now it's time to go home!\nI wonder if I'll come across that police officer I met last time.\n\nThird expedition to the endless tundra, 15 days from the closest research station on foot:\nI'm taking a different route this time just like HQ suggested.\n15 days into this route, however, I got stopped!\nIt's an official Messenger from Ursus.\nHe told me there's a restricted military area up ahead and I shouldn't go any further.\nI showed him the expedition permit I got from the Ursus government, their confirmation of my expedition route, as well as the commission letter for me to map this area to show that I have a right to come through here.\nHe wouldn't listen and ordered me to turn back, even claiming he has the authority to cancel these documents on the spot.\nThe words he used had a really strict tone to them, but the way he said it sounded like he was just asking me to leave.\nI have a feeling that whatever lies ahead is definitely worth probing, but I also know it's not a good idea to pick a fight with a foreign official while I'm on an expedition in their territory.\nI told him I understood and gave him a pack of scalecis jerky.\nHe calmed down right away, and said he'd be willing to help me out on my way back.\nAccording to the forecast, there will probably be another huge snowstorm the next two days, so I really welcome his help.\nI may not have been able to complete my survey's objective this time, but the results I have aren't so bad.\nWhat's more, I made myself a new friend.\nThere's some black snow falling from the sky. Is there going to be a Catastrophe soon?\nI picked up a snowflake while he wasn't looking.\nI hope I'll find something interesting out of this.'",

According to the data stored in its program, you would at least need a cushion and an ergonomic backrest for something to qualify as a chair.\nHowever, if Scene has no qualms with this being a chair, then Lens is certainly in no position to complain.\n'How much longer?'\nScene asks in her usual, sluggish tone.\n'Only 200 meters more! We'll be there soon!'\nAlthough it had figured out what its owner was going to say long ago, out of courtesy and respect, Lens waited until Scene actually asked the question to reply.\n'Oh.'\nScene returns to her silence.\nThis morning, Scene noticed a small hill as she relaxed on Rhodes Island's top deck. Although it does not compare to Sargon's tall mountains, the path they are on has nothing but flat plains, making the unexpected mountain a sight for sore eyes for Scene.\nShe firmly believed she would be able to take photos of the most breathtaking sceneries on that hill.\nSo, driven by her impulse, she immediately had Lens take care of the paperwork and borrowed a car and a few helping hands to race to the hill. This is quite the urgent issue to her, it seems.\nAlthough there is still a ways to go before she reaches her destination, Scene has already started to think about everything:\nThe angle, the lighting, the colors, and the ratio.\nThese are questions that Scene is almost always thinking about as she goes about her everyday life.\nThis is her profession as well as her hobby.\n'We are almost there, Miss Scene. The destination is right ahead, past those rocks! But neither the cameras nor I can climb any further. I am afraid you may have to walk the rest of the way.'\n'Okay.'\nScene slowly slides down from her 'chair.'\nShe readies her camera and slowly makes her way up. \nStep by step. \nBit by bit. \nThe sunlight at last reaches her eyes, revealing the world before her—\nShe still remembers how warm the sunshine was as it lands on her cheeks and how cool the breeze was as it brushed her arms.\nShe remembers the fowlbeasts' melodies, the fragrance of the flowers, the crudeness of the rocks.\nThe greenery extends endlessly until it reaches the blue sky. \nRays of lights pierce through the clouds up above.\nScene is always working on the composition of her photos in her head. \nYet when the scenery actually opens up before her eyes, thinking only serves to distract her from the task at hand. All she has to do is chronicle the view before her faithfully.\nRaise the camera and press the shutter button.\nThat's all photography involves—\nAnd what an enjoyable experience it is.\n*Ka-chick*.'",

Or is this her Originium Arts?\nI am starting to be scared.\nShe seems to have noticed how disturbed I am.\nShe smiles and starts comforting me, telling me that this is just a part of her Arts.\nAs she says that, a tiny creature appears on her palette.\nShe tells me that this is her 'assistant.'\nThe critter may not seem like it's capable of making any sounds that are less than pleasant, but I seem to be able to hear some strange noises whispered into my ears.\nI do have to admit, though. It looks really cute.\nIt's leaping back and forth between the canvas and the paint every now and then.\nIt seems it's helping Deepcolor finish this painting.\n'So that's your assistant!'\nI can't help myself but to exclaim.\nShe nods.\nShe's smiling.\n......\nHow time flies; the painting has already been completed.\nShe hands the painting to me, and I pay her the commission we'd agreed upon.\n'You'll love this portrait for sure!'\nShe seems really happy.\nOf course, I am happy too. After all, what is there to be unhappy about when a painter hands you a freshly painted portrait, especially one so lifelike?\nThe colors are bright and vivid, and the expression is true and genuine.\nThis is magnificent!\nAs I mount the painting, a question suddenly comes to mind.\nThough it was on my mind just moments earlier, I immediately forgot about it when I laid my eyes on the painting.\n'Has she ever used any colors other than blue?'\n'Where did that discomforting noise come from?'\nWho cares?\nReally, who cares?!\nIt's not nice to pry into somebody else's secrets!\nEven if something might seem off, what does that have anything to do with me?'",

In effect, her opponent already knows her like the back of his own hand.\nShe had also heard that the Fissure's armor was forged specifically to take on her weapon of choice in battle. Not only does this armor make it difficult for her to get a good grasp with her whislash, any attack she manages to land isn't going to hurt her opponent in any way.\nOn the other hand, the blades yielded by her opponent have both been treated to give them fine cutting abilities.\nShe used to think these were just rumors. Alas, it all turned out to be true.\nZofia is starting to get discouraged. After all, her last few matches have all resulted in her defeat.\nHow many companies are there sponsoring Fissure? Are there really tens of thousands of people racking their brains together just to figure out how to take on the Whislash Knight?\nShe needs to find a way to get herself out of this, lest she gets defeated yet again.\nDid Nearl use to fight all by herself as she is doing now?\nDid she waver and hesitate when she found herself at a disadvantage?\nShe knows the answer, and she also knows very well that she is not Nearl.\nWhen her techniques, weapons, and armor are unable to give her any advantages, the only things she has to rely on are the same things that led Nearl to victory.\nConviction and determination.\nShe starts switching up her attack patterns, even using techniques that she has not yet completely mastered.\nShe's relying more on her blade than her whislash to attack.\nNow, Zofia the Whislash has a clear objective:\nShe must confuse her opponent.\nShe must wait for her opponent to become distracted for even a second. \nShe must snatch his weapon away with her whislash. \nAnd before its threads snap, she must strike her opponent down!'",

      "uniEquipDesc": "'Swire, Senior Superintendent of the Lungmen Police Department, is off work today, so, just as always, she goes shopping at Paci Plaza.\nAfter a six-hour shopping spree across the entire mall, she is just getting ready to go home with eight big bags in her hands and a big smile on her face. That is, until she turns the corner to a Swire branded lipstick counter.\n'The usual. Five #38 Bullets. Thanks,' Swire masterfully asks the salesperson for her favorite lipstick.\nThe #38 Bullet has been her lipstick of choice for the past ten years. Naturally, the price is of no concern to her.\n'Of course, Miss Swire. Right away,' says the salesperson, who seems to be familiar with this process herself. She asks a coworker to take over at the counter and disappears into the storeroom to look for the lipsticks the princess personally requested. Before long, she returns with a wooden carton and hands it over to Swire.\n'Please confirm this is the correct amount.'\nWithout opening the box to check its contents, Swire merely acknowledges the salesperson and looks down to fish for something in her handbag.\nAfter a good while, she takes out a mini bag. To everyone else, this probably looks more like a petite handbag.\nShe unbuckles her bag, revealing five black velvet slots inside.\nIn each of those slots is a used up #38 Bullet lipstick.\nSwire removes her used lipsticks and places them on the counter before inserting four of her newly purchased lipsticks in the slots, with the fifth one going into her pocket instead.\nWhen she notices Swire placing her bags back on her shoulders again, the salesperson's heart begins to race.\n'Miss, would you like someone to help carry your bags?'\n'Oh? No need. They are hardly heavy at all.'\n'Frightfully sorry, but are you sure...?'\n'Yes, I'm sure,' Swire answers as she walks away from the counter. It seems she really needs no help with her bags.\nShe may not need any help, but there are others who need hers.\nNot a moment after she steps out of the shopping mall's front doors, Swire hears a loud scream for help. She turns to the scream's direction to find a thief dashing away with a woman's handbag in his hands.\nIt so happens she is running right toward a superintendent of the L.G.D.\n'What a coincidence,' Swire thinks to herself.\nBy chance, she does not have her flail with her.\nIt so happens she just bought new lipstick today.\nWhat's more, there is one right in her pocket right now.\nShe decides to teach the thief a lesson he will never forget.\nSwire sets her shopping bags down, takes out her lipstick and removes the cap, breaking the seal, and waits for the thief to come closer.\nA few seconds later, everyone in the vicinity hears a thud, followed by the thief's wail as he stumbles to the ground under the L.G.D. patrol officer's roar.\n\nSeveral minutes later...\n'Good work, Missy. You're off duty, and you still caught a thief for us.' Hoshiguma, here to oversee the arrest of the thief, forces a smile as she greets Swire, the brave good Samaritan.\nNormally, Swire would personally take the man in herself for interrogation.\nHowever, she has the day off. This case isn't hers to deal with.\n'This fellow has got to have some real rotten luck to run into me today.'\n'It's not every day someone bumps into an off duty inspector when they go to snatch something.'\n'Hmph, whatever. You take him in. I'm going home. I'll deal with the case tomorrow.'\n'If you say so, Missy.'\n'Before you go, I have a question for you.'\n'What is it?'\nSwire turns around to find Hoshiguma writing something on her case report.\n'What should I write for how the suspect was taken down?'\nSwire can tell that Hoshiguma is asking for her opinion.\n'Just write down that it was lipstick. There is no need to pull punches for someone like him.'\n'Ahaha, okay then,' says Hoshiguma as she cheerfully scribbles on her report, 'The suspect was taken down by lipstick.'\n'I don't even want to head straight home anymore.

Hurry up already.'\n'Okay, give me a second. I'll give the report to somebody else, then we can get dinner.'\n'Be sure to tell me how amazing this lipstick of yours is.'\n'Certainly.'\n\n'Why don't you carry my bags for me now?

Our forces would be too divided, and that could lead to accidents.'\n'Understood.'\n'I'll head on inside first. Take the others to the objective point as soon as it gets dark and wait for my orders.'\n'That puts you in danger!'\n'This is the best way, and it's what I chose to do.'\n'I want all of you to trust in me, just like I trust you.

The match is about to begin, and she's still not back yet? \nThis is quite unfortunate. Being late to her debut match will surely leave a bad taste in the fans' mouths. This certainly won't do any favors for Miss Valentine's future career! \nAnd in addition to that, she's going to need to personally look over her custom equipment, and if she's not here... \nHuh? Wait, what's that sound? \nHmm... Is that... somebody playing the flute? \n\nThe soft melody of the flute was gently carried along the wind, far, far away. \nEver higher, ever further away. \nThe wind continued to blow, to the place I promised to return to. \nPlease, take this tune back with you. \nPlease tell everyone. \nThat Justyna has finally become a knight. \nBut don't tell anyone. \nThat Justyna sorely misses her home. \n\n......\n......My goodness, how long have I been here?! \nI shouldn't be spacing out like that!

I've waited a whole year, and I've gotten really good with my crossbow! I can hit a tree branch from 200 meters away!' \n'Fine then, if you can go outside town, slay a gloompincer, and bring it back to camp before nightfall, I'll let you join.' \nThe squad captain couldn't talk the young girl out of it, so he wanted to make things as hard for her as possible so that she would reconsider. \nThough he had said those words half-jokingly, how could he possibly leave a child to fight against a gloompincer alone? He followed the girl quietly, curious as to what she planned to do. But when he saw her scouting out a sniping position, camouflaging into the environment, and then landing three clean shots in a row, he changed his mind. \nThe captain appeared in front of the girl as she dragged the corpse of the gloompincer back to town, the slain beast almost bigger than herself. \n'Come with me from now on.' \nThe girl lifted her head with a smile across her muddied face. \n\n'The Knight's Forest,' page 53. \nTime flies, and so the young girl grew up. She had fought in many battles against the Ursus Army, scoring success after success. The knights would come and go like the wind, routing the Ursus troops before disappearing without a trace. As their names spread fear through the ranks of the Ursus Army, the knights' prestige soared ever higher, and the girl herself became a war hero in the eyes of the people. \n'We won again. Why are you frowning?' The girl asked the captain. \n'Winter is almost here, and our supplies are running short. How long can we persist like this?' \n\n'The Knights' Forest,' page 137. \nThe fated day finally came. \nWhen the enemy army invaded, the knights prepared to sweep them with their usual hit-and-run tactics. But at that moment, the might of Ursus's artillery fell directly on top of them, and the knights were completely unable to put up a fight in the face of overwhelming military strength...... \n'Impossible! How could Ursus possibly know our precise location? It's utterly impossible, unless––' \nThe girl didn't have time for idle thoughts. The most important thing was to break free from the enemy's siege. If she died here, everything would've been for naught. \n'One day, I'll find you, whoever you are––' \nAgainst insurmountable odds, the girl somehow managed to escape the hail of bullets. Behind her... came the smoke of her hometown ablaze. \n\n'The Knights' Forest,' page 201. \nAll the pages of the book after this point were burnt, the edges of the leaf caught between the pages singed. \n\nThe leaf was laminated and stowed in the girls' tactical equipment box. Every time she put away her equipment, she would take another look at that leaf. \nThis may be the last leaf from her hometown that she can still see. \nThis is the story of an ancient war. Just another story. \nBut to Firewatch, this book – and the sole leaf remaining – seems to hold some deeper significance.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "After the regular checkup, Dr. Gavial wanted to take me out drinking, and I turned her down. It's not that I don't like her or anything; I think she's a fine person. I just don't like things that are a pain in the ass. \nIt's noisy as hell, there's alcohol, wrist wrestling, and inevitably, a little girl named Tomimi always shows up... Any single one of these things in isolation, I can probably deal with. Some, I might even call cute, but when you smash everything together, that's what you call a pain in the ass. I much prefer enjoying a glass of juice alone on the deck to spending a night at the bar. \n\nI'm almost out of juice. \nOne nice thing about being alone is that it's comfy. One not-so-nice thing is the fact that you get bored easily. \nI open up my toolbox with the mod kit and start to do maintenance on my 'gun.' Guess it's one form of entertainment. \nTwenty seconds, it's completely disassembled. \nEighty-one seconds, every part's squeaky clean. \nThirty-five seconds, the lubricant on all the metal parts has been replaced. \nFifteen seconds, the reassembly is complete. \nIf the thing in my hand was the real deal, I'd be able to do a whole lot more with the mod kit. Unfortunately, it's just a weirdly-shaped crossbow that fires a special ink bullet. Doesn't actually use Originium or anything sensational like that. \nSome things only work in the right hands. Trying to force them onto others won't end well. \n\nJust as I was deciding if I wanted to get a second glass of juice, I hear a few other people step onto the deck. Other than the sound of their footsteps, they aren't making any other noises. The people wisely keep their distance from me and stop on the side of the deck. \nBefore long, I hear a soft singing voice from them. I look back, and as expected, it's a group of Abyssal Hunters. \nAs soon as I see the three of them, my heart starts to beat faster. I once told to the Doctor it was love at first sight, though of course that was a joke. In reality, my best guess was that this unusual physiological reaction was probably related to that incident when I was a child. But I've never asked about it, nor do I think about it much. Wouldn't be able to get any answers anyway, and all the thinking in the world wouldn't solve the problem. In the end, I'd just be causing extra issues for myself. \nAnd I have a hunch – it'd be a hundred times more of a pain in the ass than Gavial dragging me to a hundred bars for a hundred nights. \nSo, as long as that thing stays far, far away from my daily life, I'm good. I have no desire to throw myself headlong into something that's gonna be a pain in the ass. \nBut occasionally, every so often... \nWhen I close my eyes, I'll see that person. I have no idea who that person is, but I can tell, they're at the center of this whole mess. \nSomeone wrapped in the smell of the sea, a robed Iberian... \nI stand up and sling the gun over my shoulder, pick up the only toolbox messy enough to be my own, and go to grab my second cup of juice.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "Ambriel received a mission today. \nA mission it might be, but in reality, it's more like a small request. \nOf course, as the request came from Beanstalk, the reward was enough to make anyone's heart waver: an exquisitely-crafted wooden music box bearing a flowering tree. As soon as she saw that music box, Ambriel thought to herself, there's nobody in this world who wouldn't be charmed by it.\n'Please help me! While I was transporting the little metal crabs, two of them got lost! They're very important to me, so please, I'm begging you!' \nWhen Ambriel went to the location indicated by Beanstalk and set up her equipment, she couldn't help but to think to herself, she never imagined she'd be out in the wilderness trying to catch metal crabs. \n'What the heck even is my job...' \n.......\n Well, whatever. Catching crabs might even be fun. All the infected wild metal crabs I've seen in the past were ugly and troublesome, but I've never seen Miss Beanstalk's crabs before. Maybe they're cute. \nInexplicable thoughts ran through Ambriel's head. \nBut the cute little crabs were not today's main agenda. \nAmbriel activated the equipment around her – the sooner she finished the mission, the sooner she'd get her hands on that wonderful music box. \nShe switched on the power, flipped the switch, adjusted the angle, entered the data, and confirmed her target's information... \nBut there was a problem. The radar appeared to be broken. \nBe it the gibberish on the data output display or the smoking battery, everything was telling her the same bad news. \nIf she had to go back to repair the radar, then she definitely would not be able to complete the mission today, and the music box... She definitely didn't want that... \n...... \n'Ohhhh! I have spare parts here!' \nAmbriel's sudden yelp echoed through the wilderness as she excitedly opened a pack of equipment. Her mood was so good she even broke out into a little hum, finishing the repairs in no time at all and returning to her original mental state. \nAfter re-adjusting the equipment, Ambriel would set up the transceiver and begin releasing her Originium Arts–– \nHmm... This reminds me of tracking down those classmates when they were playing hooky. Now, little crabs, where are you......' \n...... \nA few hours later, the pink-haired Sankta returned to Beanstalk with a breeder box, two little metal crabs rolled up into balls inside. \nIn a box behind her were three fowlbeast eggs of different colors. \nBeanstalk got her metal crabs back, and Ambriel received the exquisite music box, so beautiful that one dared not handle it with anything more than the gentlest of touches. \n'I can't believe it.' Ambriel thought to herself while joyfully looking at the music box. 'I can't believe all that equipment ended up being so useful even off the battlefield.~' \n'Um, excuse me, were you planning on hatching those?' Beanstalk pointed to the fowlbeast eggs. 'If you want to hatch fowlbeast eggs, you'll need an incubator, and you'll have to turn them over frequently...' \n'Is it that complicated?!' \n'P-Please don't just throw them out though! You can ask Miss Vanilla... She'll be able to teach you!'",

      "uniEquipDesc": "'If Originium really has the ability to store information, and we are able to decode and translate it, then Columbia's science and technology will surge forward by leaps and bounds!' \n'I've encountered a bottleneck. Current electronic computational devices are not able to handle the enormous amount of information contained within Originium. I need a more suitable computational carrier...' \n'Having a person do it?! This is certainly a bold line of thinking. I... have to give it some thought.' \n'The prototype decoding device using a human computational carrier has been manufactured. Now, I just need a test subject with a clear mind and quick reflexes, preferably with a good understanding of computers and data.' \n'Subject selection complete. Subject codename: Ptilopsis.' \n'There is nobody in Rhine Lab more suitable than she is. Though my supervisor advised me to keep the experiment a secret from her due to its risks, I still informed her of the various possibilities that might arise during this experiment. This is my line in the sand, as a citizen of Columbia, and as a person.' \n'She agreed! She agreed! I knew it, I just knew she'd agree! I knew she'd be the one!' \n'I've already taught her the key points and operating procedures of the preliminary phase. She's a quick learner, and tomorrow, the experiment will begin. I trust we will join hands to usher in Columbia's future.' \n'The experiment has been going very smoothly, and all the data has fallen within the control range. We'll keep following this pace, and soon enough... Just a little more... Wait, no, no, no! This shouldn't be happening! H-Hurry, unplug her––' \n'The failsafe mechanisms activated in time, but... she still sustained injuries... Her brain...' \n'And the Originium infection...' \n'(Short, intermittent sobbing sounds)' \n'The higher-ups have already sent for emergency dispatchers, but, but this...' \n'It's my fault... It's all my fault...' \n'Based on the information she received before, I made a chip that can be inserted inside the body. This chip should be able to replace a portion of her brain's functions.' \n'Several of the department heads seem quite fond of this suggestion. Hmph. I know what they're thinking.' \n'The implant procedure was successful, but she's unresponsive.' \n'She's awake! But her language functions... seem to have some problems.' \n'She told me, another voice appeared inside her head, one that did not belong to any of the languages she knew. It placed a huge burden on her psyche.' \n'Only the use of machine logic language could soothe the pain.' \n'She is the first person in Columbia to survive a chip transplant operation. This is a pioneering achievement.' \n'But the world through her eyes seems to have become something altogether different.' \n'I also implanted a chip into my own brain, and the wound still aches, but I want to know how the information inside the Originium has changed her.' \n'What exactly is that voice?' \n'I will reproduce the experiment.' \n––Rhine Lab, Recording of Project *UNKNOWN* Director during her lifetime",

But now, we know the address of your workplace. \nHappy birthday, my dear Grace. \nInside this package is my present to you, a toolbag. \nWhen I was young, I always wanted to venture far away, so I asked a famous craftsman in Londinium to make this toolbag. It's very durable, and can hold a lot of things. \nBut after that, I returned to the life that my parents planned out for me, so I never had a chance to use it. \nEven though this world has many ways of stopping a person in her tracks, I believe that you can go further than me. \nYour father is very disappointed in himself. He wants to go to Rhodes Island to look for you, but doesn't know how to face you, nor does he know how to deal with what would come next. If you ever see him, I hope you two can sit down and talk things through. \nMy daughter, no matter what happens, I will always support your decisions and your dreams. \nIf Henry disagrees with you, then I'll talk him into it. \nOne last thing: Your father found someone to make a whole bunch of those sweets you used to love as a kid, even though he was also the one who forbade you from having them... If they show up in the mail, don't eat them all at once! \n \n––Beatrix Arizona \n \n \nGrace, I made a trip to Rhodes Island. Your coworker said you were out in the field, in some dangerous place no less. Something about being a battlefield medic for Rhodes Island. \nThe way I understand things is, Rhodes Island might be one of the best places in this world, but if you stay here, you should behave like a patient rather than running amok like you are now. \nWe can afford the cost of your treatment, but we can't afford to lose you a second time. \nI've brought you some food and supplies. Some of it's perishable, so don't forget to eat it. \nIf you ever need anything, just let me know. \nBeatrix wants me to sit down and have a good talk with you, so I'll come back next month. \nAlso, your mother wants to hear back from you more often. \nThe desk drawer in your dorm was broken, so I repaired it. Try not to stuff too many things in there. \n\n––Henry Arizona",

With cup cradled, he stares out at the emptiest street in gold, squints ever so slightly, and under the loop of his collar the crystals at his throat, grown distinct these recent evenings, faintly stings. \nHe remembers the ringleader, who rarely shows in person beyond giving him instruction, raising the matter with him not long ago. \nComing with praise, eager to see the day he truly joins. \nSaying, I hope you reserve nothing for this play. \n—It will be his stage alone. \nAt times, the performer feels a whisper of anxiety, source unknown. But beneath that unease pallid as the Victorian mist, it is clear to realize for him that he cannot hold back the feeling of joy. \nThis will be no ordinary play, a play like no other the traveling troupe has hitherto performed, unlike any stage he has trodden before. \nThis will be his play, and his entire life, his kismet... \n\n'Mew.' \nA black kitten appears on the street corner. Few have seen a being beautiful as it, as if a certain legend where at times they show before others as they please, a legend as if the black cat here now. \nThe performer's train of thought is broken. The uncanny fervor in his eyes dissipates, and his look relaxes, watching the cat delicately pace towards him, and he lets out a smile unawares. \nHe is in love with coming to this little town's street corner these days. On it there are few, and it is calm, and the tea is not exceptional, but a black cat does always patron it, placing golden sunsets underfoot with its perfect composure, on its leisurely stroll. \n'Meow.' \nIts tail elegantly sways, approaches his side. \nThe performer tries to reach a hand out to the black cat, and it gives an askance look, its ears shake a shiver, but it does not show immediate refusal. Thus he carefully strokes its finely sheened fur, the sunset that lingers on this kitten soaking into his fingertips. \nHis smile supplants all other mood in his vision; the performer has long since had a fine name in mind for his unusual new friend, and merely has not given it yet. \nHe has decided, if this black cat keep coming forevermore, he will ask her: would you like to walk with me?",

Here I am, in the end, only now realizing I can't form a clear picture of what it is I even want to do. \nI'm certainly not qualified to be lecturing you on this occasion. \nOn another note. You have a certain fondness for elaborate toys, so I've made you a Rubik's cube. It's open to being dismantled, and there are some tricks to it.

She's here, waiting. \n\nFootstep noises. \nThe sound of boots treading on leaves. \nThe lone wolf patiently waits, until the prey has moved to the other side of her vision. Then like an apparition, she flits behind them, a cold glint in her hand. \nIn the next instant, the lone wolf's figure fades back into the night. \n\nThe visitor warily watches around, inspects their pocket, feels what they should between their fingers. They relax with a sigh, continue on, but are oblivious that the chip in their pocket has already changed homes. \nEven the counterfeit they feel now will, in a few short minutes, slip from their pocket, to disappear into the eddy of the woods' falling leaves. \n\nAfter all other breaths vanish, the lone wolf's figure emerges from the pile of withered leaves. \nThe true prey, the chip, securely lies deep in her knapsack. \nMission complete, the lone wolf sets back on foot, but her mood is by no means restful. \nDisconnected from her mission already, she's enveloped by the scent of the deserted overgrowth, and remembers Siracusa's wilds. \n\nShe walks alone, the past on her mind. \nThe wilds were drenched in blood. Grandma taught her how to get out of them, then straight away threw her into their midst. \nShe got out. \nShe exhausted a whole life's worth of possibilities at once, soaked in blood from head to toe, and finally got out. \nGrandma was very pleased, but as she expected, Grandma was no more than that either. \n\nShe got out of the wilds, and came headfirst into the maze, life's maze, far vaster than the wilds ever were. \nThe maze had uncountably many ways through, and Grandma never taught her a single one. \nSo she didn't know life's meaning, and she didn't want to either. She had no desire in her to learn, or to give it any trial and error. She just wanted the simplest way out of this whole maze— \nWithout Kal'tsit, she would be gone by now. \n\nKal'tsit said if you don't know where you can go, then stopping where you are, giving thought to the way forward, isn't necessarily a bad idea; during that time, she would be given shelter. \nShe listens to what Kal'tsit says. \nFor now, she stopped at a crossroads called Rhodes Island, and got food, a place to stay, and a salary she doesn't know the use of. She even got a small fluffy ball, stuffed in her knapsack, that she can hold in her hand when there's no Lupo's tail to stroke, letting her feel fur brushing past her fingertips. \nBut how long is she going to stay here? \nKal'tsit didn't say. \nBut she's ultimately unable to adapt to this tremendous maze, and the wilds stopped needing her long ago. \nSo, is she going to leave? \nShe doesn't know. \n\nThe dagger she knows lies deep in her knapsack, letting out a minute hum, just like a whimper.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "The year she turned five, Waai Fu was taken to a study by her father. A few massive bookshelves filled the room totally full, all sorts of old books all over them, ancient records from all manner, ways and styles of martial arts. \n'Choose one, learn it. In three months, show it to me.' \nWaai Fu—still not able to read too many words—spent a while hesitating, then selected a book from the shelves caked in dust, with 'The Classic of Hung Mei Wing Chun' written on the cover. Waai Fu had no clue what kind of technique this was, or what characterized it. She simply thought it had a very nice name. \nHer father hadn't given her a single pointer, so Waai Fu had to pore over the books by herself. Yes, she didn't understand the words too well, but the phrases in there—'wicked walks vengeance heady; just employs mind and soul' and the like—flew completely over her head. But she still followed the movements in the pictures, practicing punch after punch, step after step. Assiduous, not allowing an inch of slack. \nThree months later, before her father, Waai Fu finished demonstrating the whole set of techniques, three-hundred-and-twenty-seven moves in all, flowing like nature, not a single one missed. But once her father finished watching, he furrowed his brows and sighed a rough sigh. \n'No. No good. Try again.' \nWaai Fu didn't know why, but had no alternative but to listen. \nOne year later, her father began to take Waai Fu through some simple fighting exercises. He clearly didn't give it much strength, but Waai Fu still found herself caught out again and again, and every time, her father's fists would never pull back as they landed on her. \nWaai Fu didn't understand. Clearly she knew every move by heart, but why couldn't she make fluent use of them? She decided to look within the manual again for answers, and after several times parsing from cover to cover, she finally found, in one unremarkable corner, a phrase. \n'Ways aloft may decree, but man is what makes change.' \nAnd a few more years later, Waai Fu could recite that book in her sleep, the tomes now shelved in a nook of her room, rarely flipped through anymore. In her training, too, her father came to chide her less and less, and she felt he was becoming less strict than he was before. But suddenly, her father left home. He left behind a pair of daggers, and a single phrase. \n'I must go and find something.' \nWaai Fu was unable to comprehend just what could be worth her father abandoning her, abandoning this home, to search for. It was only a few days after that Waai Fu left home too, to live somewhere different. \nWhile tidying her room, she again saw the manual, and offhandedly, flipped through it. From start to end, page by page, it was like her past lay before her. She found, at the very end of the very last tome, clearly written: 'Martiality asks mastery, this only from thorough training. With no purpose and no self, there is no boundary and no end.' \n'You're right, father. I'll catch up to you, and become stronger than you.'",

Only a few days you've been here, and you think that gives you the right to go sparring with that mouthy bastard lot? How many times have I told you, take things in order!' \n'Yes.' \n'Stand here! You're not to move from this spot until I say so!' \n'Yes.' \n...... \n'Why are you still here?' \n'You had me stand here as punishment...' \n'It's alright, you've been there long enough. That'll teach you, won't it?' \n'But it's only been five minu—' \n'Shut up, you little scamp. Any more lollygagging and there's no dinner tonight for you, got it?' \n'...Yes, Master.' \n'That's a bit more like it. Yes, have this biscuit. You must be starving, aren't you?' \nI shakily took it, but didn't dare put it near my mouth, fearing the master of the house would suddenly beat me, just as the villagers did. \n\n'I've seen the report. To do so finely on your first outing... not an easy feat.' \n'Thank you for the praise, hehe.' \n'Don't be so smiles and giggles with me. I still need to ask about something. After the assignment ended in Leithanien, you spent a while longer there. What was that about?' \nI heard some information pertaining to army mobilization on the border, and with the extra time I had, once I'd applied to the authorities, I went to investigate.' \n'Do you know how sensitive the Leithanian army's nose is?' \n'But...' \n'There are no buts! Even if they approved it, I permit you not to act without permission! If this happens again, I'll have you confined!' \n'Yes, Master.' \n'I'll forgive you this time. Even if you had the luck not to run up against the army, you must be covered in scrapes, aren't you? Take my card, and get to the hospital for a checkup! Now, immediately!' \nThe master of the house always had a volatile temper. Just as this time showed, if one thing didn't suit his mood, he'd yell his head off at me. \n\n'Master, look! I'm discharged and perfectly fine, aren't I?' \n'You think coming out of hospital's the end of it? Your assignment was to draw that Ursus spy out, and I could deal with him myself. Who asked you to block his blade in my place?' \n'It was an emergency...' \n'An emergency's no excuse either! I need to teach you a proper lesson, so this mess doesn't happen next time.' \n'How are you going to teach me my lesson, then?' \n'Erm...' \n'Have you decided?' \n'Hmph, you little scamp. You never listen to a thing I say.' \n'I've always felt I'm a very obedient one, though.' \n'...Right. Look at that old tat you're wearing. You're a fourth-order knight already. How can you be so neglectful of your own appearance?! This is your allowance for the month. Take it, and go buy some new clothes! You're not allowed back until you spend every last cent of it!' \n'Master, with this much money, do you want me to be buried alive under clothes?' \nThe master of the house awkwardly cleared his throat, quickened his step, and walked off before me. The setting sun spilled across his shoulders. \n\n'Come back to Kazimierz, should you want to come back. And should you not... then do not be burdened, and go!' \n—This was the parting advice the master of the house gave to me. \nDoctor. I know you know, I was trafficked to Kazimierz before I could even remember. The village that bought me was end to end of hard servitude and beatings; even after I'd fled, I couldn't free myself from people who marked me with prices. \nBut the moment the master of the house and I met our eyes in the 'market'... \nThat was the first time fate showed me any kindness.",

Three hours? Five? The golden sands rush through my clothes, tempest throwing the dust against my face, without reprieve, so rough against my eyes I have to keep them shut. But we can't stop yet—the Sarkaz mercenaries behind us are still fast on our tail—they're trained and tireless—even a sandstorm couldn't hold their march back. \nAnd the water... might have been drunk dry long ago. \nI've heard traditions that in the desert, filling empty canteens with sand can give people hope, but right now, I've drunk enough sand. Water—I just want one gulp of water. Even if it costs every coin of mine in exchange, I would do it. \nBut in these wilds, the shine of metal has no meaning at all. \nClutching this silver case tight, I grit my teeth and keep striding. \nMy ears are battered with mournful screams. Like the deceased are howling, and ghosts are calling. Maybe Professor Thorne is among them, calling my name? \nBut I can't quite make it out. \nHow long has my brain spent filled with these noises now? Three minutes? Three hours? Or three years? \nThe dust has blocked the sky out, day and night all the same now, time practically stood still, and only the people seeking to survive through all this still endure through this welter of punishment. \nI just wanted to research, I just wanted to offer my strength to the furtherment of science. I didn't want this—desiccating away in this sea of sands—not like this. \nMy head aches and swells and stings, my body seemingly gone long without any sense. Am I walking, or am I watching this body named Elliot squirm? \nNo... thinking too has become too much to ask. Only one thing wanders in my head, a single order: move. \nMove... move... move... \n...but the desert is limitless. \n'Elliot, open your mouth.' \nOpen my mouth? \nI subconsciously slacken my muscles, let my lips and teeth reveal the channel to my oral cavity. \nA fruit coated in sand and soil lands in my mouth. \nAcrid? And sweet? Oh, it's water. It's water. \nIt's water. \n...... \nSince when, I don't know, but there's no more wind at my ears, the land has returned to peace, and there's only sun, sand, and two earthly humans walking through the dunes. \n...... \nI gaze off far. Beyond the yellow dust, is still more yellow dust. \nNo end is in sight, just like technical documentation scattered all across the ground to be trodden by wet leather shoes, no longer able to be reassembled, nor made sense of. \nIn anger, I kick at the sand, and watch it tumble and slide down the dune, then blend again into the desert, as if nothing ever happened. \nSand, sand. \nI begin to hate sand for the first time in my entire life. \n'Let's go. We'll be able to replenish supplies very soon.' \nKal'tsit interrupts my train of thought. \nUm, very soon? How soon can it be? \nAnd resupply? How much could that be? \nBut—Kal'tsit never promises hope to anyone. \nBut at least... \nI think I can see a cactus.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "To Pudding, nothing beats the time spent kicking back and relaxing in a Sami cabin. \nOn Sami's south border, Columbians have obtained land and resources from the Sami through trade, nomadic cities following caravans and mining ships crossing age-old tundra. The founding of trade enclaves represents the first time in a century the Sami have opened borders, Columbian caravans and corporate engineer teams becoming frequent guests at Sami's frontier. Ever since she was young, Pudding's frequently gone with her parents to Sami, headed for that ancient land. \nIce and snow blanket the earth wide, sunshine spilling over and refracting, as if a realm paved full with gems. But this is only one corner of Sami. \n'On the tundras of Sami far from civilization, in the forever hibernal Fjal Vetrtonn, most Sami by far still carry on their millennium-old ancient way of life. They're far removed from the Columbian enclave, indifferently surveying all from the Fjal Vetrtonn and bone-chilling winds. Time freezes upon their skin,' says the Sarkaz owner of the coffee shop. 'Don't you want to go deeper and see? See the sights of those tundras and mountains, how the Sami get along with nature in the wilderness.' \n'Am I allowed to?' Pudding hesitantly asks. 'I'm not sure if they'd welcome a city person like me...' \n'Sami does not defy its own fate. We know what it faces, and know how it will respond.' \nAnd so Pudding signs up to join a local supporting construction project, departing early morning one day, going with the team of Columbian engineers into the Myrkwood that she once only gazed at from afar. \nIn the primordial woods, the Sami steadfastly distance from modern technology. Only one subset, a wetland settlement near to the autonomous region, is willing to receive the Columbian engineers' help. \nConstructing a base station, connecting cables, turning on the village's first bulbs... Pudding stares at the faint lights, and the grin of satisfied wonderment on some Sami faces, and it suddenly hits her just what technology means to these people. \nBut it's only in places more remote still, where the true secrets of the Sami lie, a land the Columbians cannot pry into. \nPudding's vacation will be over very soon. She writes up her experiences in the village into a report, and puts it inside her suitcase, ready to take it back to Columbia. \nI'll come back again very soon, she thinks happily. \nYet because of one accident, this hope, ordinary by all rights, spends a long, long time delayed, before she can make good on it.",

Wei Yenwu did not appear, and merely sent someone to plant a new tree. She never hoped for Wei Yenwu's acknowledgement again.\n1st of January, heavy rain. On a New Year's visit, in the downpour, she saw an injustice on her way to the slums, struck out in anger, and took fifteen on her own. In this moment of mortality, she fled into the night by her hilted sword, harming seven, repulsing eight.

Chi Xiao was unsheathed a second time, cut open a treasury door, and saved the hostages within. She began to understand, Chi Xiao was a sword of will. She thought she had always done more than enough, but had in actuality done too little. She had to be faster, and mightier.\n7th of July, cloudy. On her birthday, over a decade coming, Wei Yenwu asked for the first time to see her swordplay. She condensed all she'd learned, and made an incomplete Cloudsplitter her final examination's answer. Wei Yenwu did not comment.\n1st of January, clear. Left Lungmen together with Rhodes Island. From here on forth, Chi Xiao will rarely be unsheathed.",

Even though she came on to take treatment and aid, she can still take up the yarn as she likes. She's even started a cozy little class in the sewing room, teaching children who look forward to the future just as she does.\nIt was all curious and new for the first-time visitors. They squeezed about, reaching out to touch all the tools on the tables—a boy amongst them knocked a fabric cutter away by accident, making a slice in the cloth.\nIt panicked the children so suddenly, and without thinking they started to push at the perpetrator, who was even more frightened himself.\n'You messed up Miss Bibeak's clothes!'\n'Miss Bibeak! He did it!'\nBibeak saw the damaged cloth, but didn't even have the chance to speak before the boy, now bright red, fled the room.\nOnce Bibeak assuaged the children, she inquired where he might've gone, and after a knock and an 'Are you there?', the teary-faced boy came out of the door to his room. His head was hung low, and he held out his savings bank.\n'I put all my pocket money in this burdy bank! I'm really, really sorry for ruining your clothes, Miss Bibeak!'\nJust as all teachers should, Bibeak knelt down and softly patted him on the shoulder to console him, and the sobs from the crybaby in her embrace gradually ceased.\n\nThere's always far too much in life that runs contrary to your expectations, just like how Bibeak doesn't know what kind of design her pencil will put to paper in the coming seconds. Will it gild the lily, so to speak? Or will it change everything about what it was?\nShe accepts the savings bank, but does not break it open. She prepares to revise the style of clothing, planning to sew a shirt fit for a grown child to wear.\nOrdinary tailors would amend an unwitting mistake, but a good tailor allows it to transform into a happy accident, one nobody sees coming.\nWhen the children come to the sewing room for classes again, the boy who blundered last time has his head low, standing at the very back.\nWith a smile, Bibeak pulls him up to the table, and takes out the all-new shirt: 'I've accepted your burdy bank. Let everyone take a look, now—these are clothes made for you.'\nThe children erupt in cheers, and they shove on the lucky little boy, clearly even more excited himself.\nHis cheeks are aglow, and Bibeak knows, he'll surely cherish this present, and when he puts it on afterwards, he'll go do the right thing.\nThat's what a tailor dreams of, using needle and thread to sew fine futures and bring them to others.\nPutting wishes and hopes into dress, for every person to wear.",

For people like them who deal in blood, letting the goods escape doesn't just affect their reputation, it impacts their business, so they'll kill their friends, and it won't weigh on them one bit. But for the sake of this innocent girl, nothing will stop her.\nCutter conceals herself in the pitch-black night. A dull, bad sweetness emerges in her throat, reminding her of the blood that coated her under the blazing sun in times past. But the girl on her back grips Cutter's arms tight, reminiscent of that day years ago, when she herself gripped tight onto those machetes with no owner.\nShe pushes the girl up on her back, adjusting positions, freeing herself up.\nIn the interval where her taut nerves relax, the aches on her body come with—Cutter uses the moonlight to inspect their wounds on her. A bolt shot at them hours earlier cut her shoulder and the girl's arm, the blood of the two congealed together. In this moment, thanks to the movement, fresh blood finds a way to well from her shoulder again.\nCutter tilts her head to look, her mind beginning to ring thanks to this trouble from nowhere.\nThe rope that fate bound around her neck suddenly tightens, and Cutter begins to feel this instant that her very breathing is beginning to freeze. Her hands turn cold in an instant, her heart pounding in her ears with every pulse, and she feels this darkness will drown her.\nCutter stares in shock, rooted to the ground, the cut on her shoulder smoldering red.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "Every graduate of the Victorian Royal Guard Academy must go through one final, major examination before their formal ceremony.\nAnd these were the exam details Bagpipe received: infiltrate a logistics warehouse in south Castshire County, and rescue a civilian abducted by local bandits.\nBefore departing, Bagpipe was called to the staff office.\n'Do not alarm the local barracks or the police.'\n'Do not bring unrelated affairs in this.'\n'Do not sustain injury.'\nThese were the three requirements her teacher relayed to her.\n'Are these orders, Mr. Slim?'\n'Ugh,' he sighed, looking her up and down. 'Take this as a request from me to you.'\nEarnest, Bagpipe jotted these three requests down in her pocket notebook, and at the top, she gave the 'rescue!' she'd already written before a mighty underline.\nThe first half of the mission went without a hitch.\nShe infiltrated the target location, laid under a container, waited a full ten hours, and finally the bandits showed.\n'How about her?'\n'Shut her by herself in the red car. How do we handle her?'\n'How? How do we handle her? YOU do me a clean bloody job is how.'\nThe red car. Bagpipe's ears immediately caught the key words, and she locked onto the target without any wasted time.\nLights out for the two bandits posted in the car, and she found the civilian, anaesthetized and unconscious, as well as catching another group's conversation.\n'They all staying put?'\n'Drugged them good. Not going nowhere.'\n'IDs in order?'\n'Baron helped sweeten the police. They move fast.'\n'Any other locals noticed?'\n'Noticed? They just came from Sargon, plus they're all criminal. You think their families'll want to come looking for them?'\n'Alright, then we're off tonight. Got a dozen labs in Columbia poking us in the arse to get this done.'\nTwo seconds Bagpipe hesitated, then she opened her notebook to look. Three seconds her eyes lingered on the first line, and then she shut it.\nThe sound of a freight lorry's ignition reaching her ears, she glanced left and right, then found the largest parked vehicle around, and with the mission objective on her back, hopped into the driver's cab.\nEngine on, accelerator down, nice and easy.\nThe freight lorry didn't get very far at all, before running straight into a container crane that showed up at the entrance out of nowhere. Driven like it was possessed, it smashed half the warehouse wall while it was at it.\nA few minutes later, the alarmed police scurried over, and led away twelve bandits all seeing stars, as well as Bagpipe, who'd lost a bit of skin off her left index finger.\nOnce back at school, Bagpipe sought out the teacher.\n'I'm sorry about those three requests. I couldn't even manage one of them.'\nFor a long while, the teacher was silent, before picking up a recommendation letter to hand her.\n'Ehhh? Storm Company? Could I really, Mr. Slim?'\n'I had the letter ready long ago.'\n'Oh, thank you, sir!'\n'That said... do you know who the person you got into a car crash was?'\n'The mission target, right? No?'\n'A soldier from the Storm Company acting as an unconscious civilian. She and her squadmates were tasked with taking out those twelve bandits in the first place. By the way, thanks to you, their mission's already done.'\n'So where was my target, then?'\n'In the car accident. Don't worry, none of them came to harm, and they're all home safe and sound now.'\n'Then, umm, then... I completed my mission after all?'\n'You did.' The teacher patted her on the shoulder, let out another sigh, and spoke. 'You pass. After you officially report in for duty, you'll be allowed real Fortcracker shells.'\nBagpipe's eyes went wide. Realizing her teacher meant she could be like all the other students, cheering and celebrating their own happy graduation, she pumped her fists, the excitement growing vast in her face.\n'I was thinkin', odd that 'civilian' was over two meters! And she was just too cool! Can-can-can I really be squadmates with soldiers just like her? I... oh, do I need to think of a codename too? What did you say they all use? Instruments? I... hold on, I don't even need to switch codenames then! Sir, sir, is there anythin' you think I should probably bring when I report in? I dunno, d'you think they might not like mince puddin'? Oh, and, and...'\nDon't fault me for this, Rita, trust me.\nYour teacher can't help knowing she's a true good student, and she'll be... she'll be a fine soldier too, for sure.",

Not that I'm saying unlocking things isn't what a police officer should do... just...'\nIt's just that she finally gets to do something she's dreamt of since the beginning.\n\n'We've been attacked by an armed group, and we're low on heads! Division Three requesting backup!'\n'How are you, Division Two? Send two for emergency support! Hold on until HQ get here!'\n'It's Grani's team... She shouldn't be taking assignments like this...'\nThe fleet transporting the convict come to an emergency stop under the sudden attack, and though they're prepared for this, the numbers they're facing still exceed the mounted police's expectations.\nGrani holds a defensive posture behind the escort vehicles, the convict still inside, held by a teammate—they're not letting the door open again under any circumstances, as per code, so no worries about the subject.\nAfter that comes devoting everything to prolong the ceasefire as long as possible, waiting for support.\nBut her superior's words just now get Grani a little mad. She's heard words to that effect more than enough times, yes, but today's her first time on an official assignment, and she thought that was recognition of her ability.\n...Guess it wasn't.\n\n'All you need to do is stay here and defend the vehicle, and wait for us to sort this out.'\nGrani watches her two seniors run in armed against their fire, and they take down one, two... even more of the enemy appears from behind the bunker, shouting 'There's only two of them!' and rushing... her seniors and teammates suddenly fall, they pull their hands from the wounds they were clutching, and Grani sees palms red with blood.\nThe parked fleet creating its own highly useful bunker, Grani conceals within it and launches charge after charge. Her teammates have lost hope until they see her routing the enemy's formation, and they're hauled back into safety one after another by this pint-sized girl. The opposition so much as beats a retreat for the time being.\n\n......\nThe support squads following up take over the task of escorting the convict, and Grani keeps her injured seniors and teammates company on the way to a nearby hospital for treatment.\nBit by bit, she's been changing the way people see her, and though she's never rejected herself, getting the recognition of others is something that pleases her all the same.\nGrani dusts off the badge on her shoulder, a bit of ash stuck to it from the conflict before, and now it glimmers bright.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "Iwona Krukowska's greatest regret is that she was unable to take the wine chalice in her room with her when she left Kazimierz.\nThat goblet forged of gold was a coming-of-age present. No child at that point in the Krukowska family was as gallant as her, and she became the knight they placed their hopes in.\nIwona was used to long-term life in the camp. Scarce on modern means of entertainment, she upheld the strictest work-rest cycle and physical training, all of it for one purpose, becoming a campaign knight—the bravest campaign knight of them all.\nTo the Krukowska family, attaining service as a campaign knight is the highest honor of them all. The ancient family defends at the borderlands, their backs to the prosperous clamor of Kazimierz's cities, facing the frostbitten winters of Ursus. Iwona grew up on stories of heroism, and grew a pure fear and longing for that dangerous, tumultuous battlefield like nothing else.\nThe day her family Knight Primus granted her the chalice, it ensured Iwona had no second thoughts. She beat pure hot blood with every pulse. She signed up to every arduous training regimen with no care for the risk, and improved herself through it. She never took notice of whatever grimy deals and nonsense slander laid behind those majestic ideals. She...\nShe ran too fast, forgot precautions were always called for in perilous circumstances, and just one negligent second would be all it took to brew a tremendous tragedy.\nIwona only forgot this one thing. Just one time.\nShe was mercilessly thrown to the ground in the open country. A lone person hurrying, a lone person wounded, a lone person helpless. Those wild beasts growing Originium crystals wailed at her in their death throes, piercing her eardrums. Those sharp Originium crystals, sent every way by the explosion, skewered a body that wouldn't move as she asked.\nMaking it on willpower until aid came running, Iwona was lucky to survive. But after that, she was thoroughly cut away from the life she used to live.\nThat chalice was placed in her display cabinet, separated by a glass door, and every time Iwona came home, she would wipe it clean.\nShe tried returning to her family afterwards, to at least see her own mother and father again one more time, go back into her room, take away some memories of hers—\nNot once more has she set foot through that heavy wooden door.",

Open it and try them on, time's a-wastin'... crap, am I spoiling the surprise? The Doctor's not gonna dock me for this, right?'\nThe Vampire engineer hastily covers her mouth, and tiptoes out of the special dormitories, winking at Reed before she shuts the door.\n'Happy holidays!'\n'Happy... holidays.'\nReed holds her parcel, fixed to the spot, unsure if her murmur succeeded in floating past the door.\nFor her, holidays are difficult to reconcile with happiness.\nIt was on the stroke of a holiday that her mother and father died. The gift they'd brought back from Londinium fell at her feet, wrapping stained with blood.\nHer sister dragged her out of the snow, pulling her hand, passing through one alley after another. Candlelight shone on window after window, but nothing lay ahead of them at all.\nWith the footfall behind them drawing closer, her sister told her to hide, finding her the darkest corner to tuck herself in, her chest burning from not even daring to breathe.\n'It's alright now, Loughshinny. Stand up.'\nThe voice of her sister returned to her side. She opened her eyes, saw the firelight creep out from a stranger's window, and it became a strange purple, and malevolent in its very look, scaring even the pitch-black night away.\nHer legs were still too weak to stand. No more did her sister hold out a hand, but went back into the glow of the blaze. She knew that if she couldn't follow, then she would be forever left behind.\nShe grit her teeth and slowly rose up, pushing back the fear and pain, chasing the figure in the firelight. Without knowing it, she ran farther and farther, becoming too but a small shadow.\nEver since, the fire never truly went out. It burned within her eyes, inside her heart, the night of every festivity.\nFive years on, her sister placed a spear in her hands.\nIn her recollections, this was her last time being given a holiday gift. Since then, the flames came to ignite at her spearpoint too.\nSlowly, she became used to the heat, to the scorching that stabbed through her body with each breath. She believed this undying flame would be with her for life, even chasing her in death.\nUntil she received this present.\nShe realizes, and it startles her. So there were people who'd still try to put water to these raging flames.\nIn every test and training thereafter, Reed puts on these gloves, and after the battle, she'll attentively clean her spear's blade according to her manuals.\nShe hasn't told Closure that in actuality, there exists no reagent nor material that can cool a Draco's flames.\nAfter all, when she touched this gift, she truly did feel a long-lost, refreshing chill.",

Why?'\nVigna receives a puzzled stare in response.\n'Why am I going back to Kazdel now?'\n'Always comes a day Sarkaz head home again, right?'\n'Hahahahah, you're kidding, Vinny.'\nThe young Sarkaz stands up.\n'I'm a Columbian.

      "uniEquipDesc": "Margaret, clad in a full suit of armor, clutches a wooden swordstaff in hand, focusing her attention on confronting the man in front of her. \nThe wooden sword swaying gently in his hands reveals no hostility at all, but Margaret knows that if she lets her guard down even for a second, that sword would bypass her swordstaff and lightly tap her on the head. \nUsing the range advantage of her swordstaff, Margaret repeatedly probes her opponent. As usual, her opponent momentarily leaves an opening for her, and she seizes the opportunity and thrusts forward with her swordstaff.\n'Well done, Margaret.' Schnitz Nearl falls to the ground, pretending to be helpless, lying there as he smiles and shows his daughter a thumbs-up. \n'Father...'\nSince she began her combat training, Margaret has rarely landed a blow on the man.\nBut this time...\n'Did, did I do it right?'\n'You did. You did a great job, Margaret.'\n'Do you think you can help me up now?'\n'S-Sure. I'm sorry, Father.' Margaret hurriedly sets down her swordstaff and grabs her father's hand with both of hers, using all her strength to pull him off the ground. \n'A good showing, young foal. Now even your father is no match for you.'\nMargaret's mother, Yolanta, appears at the training area's entrance carrying Maria, who is still a baby, in a swaddle blanket.\n'Haha, you should've seen how much momentum she had behind that last thrust.'\n\n'Mother, what brings you here?' \nIt is late at night, but Margaret sees that her mother is neatly-dressed and carrying a suitcase, as if getting ready to go out.\n'It's almost time, Schnitz. Put yourself together.'\n'Alright, give me five minutes.'\nThe father takes off his training pads, revealing the suit of armor underneath.\n'Mother, Father, where are you going?'\n'I'm sorry, my child, but we can't tell you.'\n'Just imagine we're heading up north to buy you some souvenirs.'\n'A-Are you going to be gone for a long time?'\n'Yes...' Margaret's father is deep in thought for a moment. 'It might take a bit of time.'\n'So, can we ask you for a little favor, Margaret?'\n'I'm listening, Mother. I promise I'll do whatever I can!'\n'First of all...' the mother squats down and hands the sleeping Maria to the young girl. 'I'll need you to take care of your little sister and your grandpa.'\nThough Maria was not heavy at the time, when Margaret held her, she gripped her carefully for fear that her sister would fall from her arms.\n'If you have any questions about combat techniques, you can ask your uncle. He has much more experience than your father does.'\n'Yes, Father...'\n......\n'Is there anything else you want to say?'\n'That's about it.'\nKnock, knock, knock––\nSomeone is at the door.\nShe feels each knock pounding at her heart, striking her with fear.\nHer parents are about to leave.\nHer father readies his swordstaff, and her mother readies her bow. Margaret follows them to the door.\nWhen the it opens, two campaign knights in silver armor stand before them.\nTo Margaret, they look like a pair of man-eating monsters.\n'Lord Schnitz, Lady Yolanta, we have instructions to escort you out of the Grand Knight Territory.\nThe parents agree in hushed voices, then turn back to Margaret.\nSchnitz hugs Margaret and Maria tightly.\nYolanta leaves a heavy kiss on their cheeks.\nMargaret stands in the doorway, watching her parents' figures grow fainter and fainter.\nThe whole time, she expected her parents to suddenly turn back to tell her it was all a prank.\nShe expected her uncle, who had watched her parents depart from outside the door, would go bring them back to the warmth of their family. \nShe even expected her sickly grandfather upstairs to rush down and drive away the troublemaking campaign knights.\nBut her expectations were dashed.\nHer pride and her sunlight slowly disappeared to the edge of the Grand Knight Territory, never to be seen again.\nMargaret feels an emptiness inside.\nAll she can do is close the door behind her and hug her sister tightly.\nNothing more.",

A current pulls at her, trying to drag her into the ocean's depths. \nSkadi does not resist. \nGradually, the light fades from her vision, the environment around her becomes pitch-dark, and the pressure around her continuously increases. The only information about her environment reaches her through the water's flow and echoed sounds. \nBut, it makes Skadi feel at ease. It is the environment she is most familiar with. When she goes on missions with her companions as an Abyssal Hunter, she slaughters the Seaborn in waters like these, and returns to that city sitting on the sea. \nBut right now, only icy water surrounds her. \nShe begins to feel lonely. \n...... \nShe is about to arrive at the sea floor, where an underwater city flickers into view. \nOnce upon a time, these Ægir technological marvels could illuminate the bottom. But in today's memories, this city-cluster still emits a radiant glow. \nBut... \nAt some point, the city became both distant and unfamiliar. \nSkadi belongs to the sea, but she does not belong there. \nShe falls onto the sea floor, motionless. \nShe is lonely. \n...... \nA song suddenly sounds out through the sea. \nA song of nature without words, without emotions. \nShe hears it. \nThe surrounding 'creatures' follow the sound and approach––\nThey grow more numerous. Yet more numerous. \nIn the Ægir's shattered light, they appear–– \nSea Terrors, Seaborn, and the unparalleled Behemoths of the sea. \nAlmost reflexively, Skadi stands up, the Ægir greatsword appearing in her hand. \nAfter grasping the current's flow around her, she charges at the swarm of monsters in front of her. Several vague shadows accompany her in her charge forward. They are clad in outfits similar to Skadi's, and wield Behemoth-slaying weapons. \nAt that moment, Skadi feels–– \nSnap! \nSkadi wakes up. She is lying on a bed, with medical equipment around her still running. \nA Rhodes Island psychiatric operator is staring at the readings on the device, the hand that had produced that snap still suspended in midair, the other hand continuing to jot down notes. \n'How do you feel right now, Operator Skadi?' \n'I feel–– \nVery good.'",

With Oripathy...' \n...... \n...... \nYeah, about that travel planner... \nI'm not gonna get to check off a lot of things from my bucket list. \nIt sucks that I didn't even make it through a tenth of my list before getting sick. And some of the places still on it don't welcome the Infected at all. The vast tundras of Ursus, Londinium's eclectic manors, Leithanien's concert halls, Kazimierz's knight tournament arenas, the thousands of fowlbeasts sweeping across Sargon's deserts... \nI wanted to see all of them, with her. \nMight as well cross them out now... \nJeez, why am I thinking about all these things anyway... It's all because of that teacher’s pet. I listen to her nagging too much. Even when she's not here, I hear her voice in my head. \nStop thinking about these things. \n...... \nLet's keep those plans after all. \nRhodes Island is still moving forward, so I have to keep moving forward. \nMaybe one day... \nJust maybe, those places will open their doors to welcome the Infected.",

It's totally gaudy.'\n'Conviction is an extremely sacred existence, with extremely serious rituals. Naturally, the cooler the better. Don't concern yourself with unimportant things. I've recently discovered that the traditional trolley problem isn't difficult enough to challenge the geeky fellas these days, so I'm working on an upgraded, super-difficult version. I ask of you...' \n'Ahahaha, I suddenly remembered I have something to do. Let's talk more later.' \n'Fortune teller, your divination exists at the intersection of mysticism, logic, and art, just as Conviction's prior trial. I ask of you...' \n'Divination is much more practical than simply confusing people with riddles.' \n'Oh, Singer, I ask of you...' \n'......' \n'An upgraded version of the trolley problem: the surgery problem! Take this doctor next to me as an example. One day, this skilled and compassionate doctor treats six patients. They are dying and each needs different organs to be transplanted soon in order to survive, but the hospital doesn't have any of the organs in stock. While the doctor is performing a routine checkup on another patient, the doctor discovers that the patient's organs would not be rejected by the six dying patients. In fact, they would be a perfect fit. Additionally, this patient is only passing through for a checkup, and even if this patient disappeared, it would not provoke any suspicion. Now then, how should the doctor proceed? \n\nThe trolley problem is not about the answer that the respondent gives in the end, but rather about the conflict between nature and humanity experienced in the formulation of that answer. Whether the respondent hesitates, calculates, finds the situation unbearable, weighs emotions over righteousness or vice versa, all of these struggles are reflected on the outside, through micro-expressions, through one's eyes and very demeanor... \nYou really have no sense of artistry... Conviction, Conviction of course is an art. To stand trial before Conviction is an art. Every aspect of the Conviction Fist is also an art. People who have passed Conviction's test transcend and move to a higher realm. This, too, is art! Ah, whatever, it's impossible to explain these things to you people.'\n'But, you just scared that doctor away!'",

It is difficult to identify the age of an Oni, but she carries a bamboo naginata on her back, indicating that she is still a musha in training. Our florist has a secret rule: Oni are not allowed inside because their actions are uncouth, and if they are not careful, they will destroy months of the flower arrangers' efforts in the blink of an eye. We are justifiably cautious, as we never know if they might have the support of their kin from the underworld behind them.\nThere is an alley on the other side of the florist, and misbehaving students use it as a hideout. They demand money from their frail and weak classmates, throwing them to the ground or stomping on them. This Wednesday evening, I saw a little boy with a backpack run by the window with a sullen, tear-stained face and a bruised nose. On Thursday, he passed by this place with the Oni, but soon turned back alone and squirmed back into the alley. \n On Friday afternoon, I was helping the master arrange flowers when I saw people squatting along the side of the street with water pipes, wine bottles, crowbars, and the like. Before we could call the police, the person they were waiting for arrived. The Oni musha accompanied the little boy from school just like yesterday. When they got to our window, the little boy suddenly began to pick up his pace, and the teens who were bullying him quickly surrounded him. \nThey were almost ready to kill the Oni. The Oni's bamboo naginata managed to block a few blows, but was broken into several pieces by their sheer brute force. \nThen, that was the first time I saw an ‘Oni.’ \nThe Oni musha who had lost her weapon raised her fists, tearing through metal with her bare knuckles, smearing her own blood in the eyes of her opponents, lashing out with her knees and feet when her fists were blocked, striking out with her horns when her legs were restrained, biting with her teeth when her horns were blocked. When the whistle signaling the police's arrival came at last, only one was still standing – the Oni. \nShe wiped the corners of her bleeding lips emotionlessly, like the legendary man-eating fiends of lore. The people were intimidated by her silence and kept their distance to avoid her, pointing at her from behind windows and doors. \nThen, my master opened the door of the flower shop and walked out, sliding a bamboo leaf freshly-folded into an appropriate shape into the palm of her hand. \nThe young Oni warrior blinked, as if she had woken up from a nightmare, carefully closed her fist, and smiled at my master.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "When he left Lien’s, it had been raining for several days and nights in Kou-wu City. The fallen sycamore leaves densely covered the ground, burying the smell of fish beneath the soil. He bolted the gate of the kung fu hall from the inside, and in the dead of night, took a copper rod from the weapon rack used for emergencies, climbed the wall, and left the courtyard. \nNot long afterwards, a town near Kou-wu City found itself one sunglass-sporting fortune-teller extra. On sunny days, he would set up his stall at intersections, and on rainy days with few pedestrians, he would take his umbrella and go fishing by the river outside town. The umbrella perfectly covered him, its ribs heavy so it would not blow away. Some envied him for living such a flamboyant lifestyle - was he so attuned to Heaven's will that he could keep his head up above the ocean of mundane affairs? Others accused him of being a cheat and a fraud, questioning if he really knew his own destiny. \n'Of course. How could I not know?' He would reply with a smile. \nAn umbrella only protects one from the rain, but not against concealed weapons like arrows or darts. His umbrella torn, he has no choice but to pack his bags and find another town where he could mend his umbrella. Numerous are the days of dark wind and rain, and he gradually feels that he had nowhere to go. All he knows is that the endpoint of his life will still be at that martial arts hall. He needs not walk the path that follows afterwards, but he knows not how to traverse the path leading there. The inch of ground beneath his umbrella is hardly enough for him to settle down, for it is no solid roof. \nBut it is then that he meets a strange group of people. Later, he learns another saying from those people. If translated into mandarin Yanese, it would be 'Heaven's mandate lies in man.' \n––The above is what Operator Mr. Nothing told you personally. Rhodes Island is currently running from a small-scale Catastrophe in the making at full speed, but Mr. Nothing is lying on a chair without a worry in the world, his umbrella tied and tucked away at his side. Through the porthole, you can see the sun behind the Originium rain. \n'The sky clears after the rain passes. The Heavens have eyes, and gaze down upon us. Say, Doctor, would you care for a pair of sunglasses?'",

      "uniEquipDesc": "'Boy, one must choose his own path. If you wish to drift freely, you shall not starve in Lungmen. But if you wish to live peacefully, then you must master a craft. Starting today, I will teach you how to make finballs.' \n'One makes a finball the same way one makes a man, and do you know what the most important thing is?' \n'It's––' \n'Slow and steady, one step at a time!' \n'But you said the most important thing was to never lie, cheat, or steal...' \n'There are many principles required to make a man, and you would do well to remember them all!' \n'When I make finballs, I have to do every single step starting from the slaughter. So, in order to learn how to make finballs, you must also learn how to use a knife.' Uncle Tung pauses for a moment, as if sensing that the words he wanted to impart are too difficult to articulate. He squeezes out the sentence, 'I'll demonstrate one more time, watch carefully.' \nUncle Tung takes out a rolled leather bag and spreads it across the table. A row of dazzling knives reflect a blinding light. He retrieves a lively finfish from the water tank and slaps it a few times against the chopping board, its movements soon ceasing. He then takes out knives of different shapes and sizes and in turn, removes the scales with a small knife and slices open the belly with a large knife, each step orderly and neat. He shakes the complete finfish around in his hand a few times, and it turns into several different parts, neatly placed upon the table. \n'It seems complicated, and that's because it is. I'll tell you the principle behind using a knife - practice makes perfect.' \nI follow Uncle Tung's example and learn from him. I learn to slaughter the finfish, then how to make filling, then finally how to make soup. Uncle Tung calls me a fast learner, and it doesn't take me very long to join him at the stand. \nOne day, a few people come to eat finballs and order a whole lot of them. They get up and turn to leave without paying. \nUncle Tung has always allowed credit, but I know these guys and I know they aren't going to pay. Angered, I decide to teach them a lesson, but Uncle Tung rushes over and steps between me and them. \n'It's just a few finballs, just a few coins. All you have to do is remember to make up for it next time. There's always next time.' \nI had no choice but to give up, but that makes the punks even bolder. One of them shouts: \n'You filthy hawkers, clutching books all day. Think you're all high-and-mighty or something?' \nUncle Tung turns around to face them. I can't see the expression on his face, but the punks look like they’re staring straight into hell itself. They half-run, half-crawl over each other as they scramble away. \nThat night, Uncle Tung gives me that set of knives. \n'Make sure you take care of these. They might look old, but they're not cheap.' \n'Let me tell you another principle for how you use knives. The most important thing is to hide how sharp they are.'",

Do you see anything?' \n Old Lee takes out a compass from the suitcase and carries it around the room three times forward and three in reverse. He gestures with one hand, muttering some incantation. \n 'Your friend is right. That your business troubles are down to a problem with this house.' \n 'Just take a look at this room. There is no window in the east, so it lacks sunlight. The north side is suspended, making it difficult to accumulate wealth. The south faces another office building, which is an invitation of foes. But the worst thing is, there's a farmers' market to the west... Tch.' \n 'What's wrong with a farmers' market?'\n  'It reeks of death.' \n 'Indeed, it all makes sense! You are a true master!' The client leans over to Lee and looks at the compass. The disk's surface is like a mirror, a frowning face reflected within it. \n'The qi of all things heaven and earth are not in alignment. When the qi is in harmony, auspice is invited. When the qi is in disharmony, evil is invited. That this house fails to be in alignment in every direction means it is a cursed house. Stay here for too long, and I'm afraid that business aside, the owner of this house will...' \n 'Master, Master! You must help me!' \n 'Don’t panic. You are my very first client in Lungmen, and it appears that the two of us will share a bond. I'll send you an after-sale service today - if you move out within three days, I will find another place for you. I'll take care of this house for you.' \n 'Thank you so much, Master! Thank you!'  \n\n 'And that's how you rented this house for less than half its original price?' \n Later, when Lee told this story to the three youths at the dinner table, Hung clutched his belly in uproarious laughter, Aak was rolling on the floor, and Waai Fu was staring intently at the boss, as if at a swindler. \n 'Can you really get Feng Shui from a compass?' \n Lee took a sip of tea and brought out the compass, the three kids gathering around him. Reflected on its surface are three curious noggins. \n 'That guy opened a remodeling business, but all the buildings in the area were recently-built and newly furnished. Where was he going to get his business? I didn't swindle anyone.'",

Its power largely spent, it brushes against Ling's face, as if scratching an itch. \n'The company of friends, endless cups of wine. The warm wind brings me––'\n'I flipped through your recent poems...' A sudden voice rings out. \n'Brother...' \n'Warm wind, fragrant wind, easterly wind, lotus wind, willow wind, wind across the bridge, wind beneath the fan... Why don't you try going somewhere without wind for a change?' \n'Is there any place in this world that doesn't host any wind?' \nShe can't remember how many poetry meetings she has attended recently - pretty much the same gardens, the same meandering water, the same thousand cups of liquid you couldn't get drunk on, the same hundred poems, the same charming emotions. To make merry is fine indeed, but it is too easy to make merry. \n'There may be a place that needs you more... somewhere that'll let you compose new poems.' \n\nIn order to control its only water source, this mobile city does not rely on the mountains as a barrier, but rather stands on the vast desert, like a lonely giant in an unfathomably vast world with nobody else to rely on. The great wind rouses, occasionally kicking up rough sand and dust that passes across one's cheeks like daggers. \n It's not as if there's no wind here - it's just not that same kind of wind. The mountain's sanctuary is distant, the spring wind's breath expired. \nLing stares at the meadow but a stone's throw away, where the last of the remaining elite soldiers lay, their armor covered in wet spikes. Three whole battalions, yet the meadow at night is nothing but a meadow. \nAn ambush took place here. The city that rouses the night was the bait, while the meadow was the trap. \n'Light the torches brighter.' \n'They're already bright enough to attract those guys.' \n'It is for the soldiers beneath the meadow to see. War comes soon, and none shall return. Nobody can resist the urge to turn around and look. Burn them brighter, and they shall become the lights of their hometowns.' \nThe great wind cannot extinguish the flames in the meadow, the men's eyes fix upon their homes through the night. \n\nA cold wind blows, the senses stir. Her eyes open to the depths of Shancheng's night. Empty jars of Husong wine fill the pavilion, a half-written poem on the page in front of her.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "The mercenary's bag has an interlayer, and within it go things she doesn't normally bring out.\nYoung, wandering children are all too common a sight across these lands, most clinging onto their bitter lives. A little girl pleads with a group of monsters, hoping to be spared some food.\n'Please, please, help me!' says the little girl, 'I can do a lot of things, I can help you too.'\nThe monsters take pity on this wasteland vagabond, and they accept her, allowing her into a small den she can call home.\n'You're so nice!' she says, with her tiny cloth bundle. 'I can hunt—I'll bring back even more food for you.'\nThe skies grow dark, and dark means unsafe. She shrinks into her hiding spot, looking out at the dim sky.\n'We don't have enough food. You said you would hunt. Now's the time.' The leader of the squad of monsters brushes its hair out of its eyes, and says to the girl, 'Bring back more food.'\nThe girl journeys out alone into the dark, and all the creatures under the night sky tuck themselves away, leaving her with nothing. But, far in the distance, she catches sight of a small campfire, a bag of food full enough for several days, and a seemingly very listless mercenary.\n'Take it.' The thought pops into her head. Finally, she reaches out and manages to grasp the bag. Inside is something she hasn't eaten in a long time—real food.\nSnatch it, steal it, whatever it takes. Getting it is the only way the monsters will recognize her; taking it is the only way they will let her stay. She clutches it tight and starts to run.\nWith the mercenary giving chase, the girl runs all the way back to the squad of monsters, and they rush at the mercenary, claws out.\nBut the wails she imagines never come. The mercenary seems to be saying something in a loud voice. The girl peeks out from behind the bonfire. The mercenary takes the monsters once more into the black night, and after a brief departure, they come back.\nThe monsters are delighted, crying out in celebration, as they haul a modest convoy of supplies out from the night. Time passes, growing darker still, and it comes time to rest.\nThe girl lies down in relief, the mercenary takes watch duty, and after they are done celebrating, the monsters too sleep beside the bonfire.\nShe takes stock of this newcomer, and the newcomer returns her gaze. After a brief moment of eye contact, she turns away and shuts her eyes.\nThe monsters murmur as they dream, and the mercenary adds some wood to the fire. Only one pair of eyes is open, glinting in the flames, and they size up the camp.\nWhen the only sound to be heard by the bonfire is steady breathing, the girl opens her eyes.\nOnce all the other sounds completely disappear, she emerges from her hiding spot.\n'We make a good team.' In the mercenary's hand is a blade, slicked with a liquid, thick and red. The girl looks around, taking in the state of the camp.\nShe finds a patch of ground to sit down on, still more or less clean. The mercenary starts moving the things back to their camp, and, left alone, she looks up at the moons.\n'...Traitor!' The sole remaining monster charges out from some corner, breath ragged and letting out an incomprehensible voice. It grapples the girl.\n'I'm going to die like this,' thinks the girl as she struggles desperately. 'I can't die.'\nA hole is made in her little bundle; a shard of a blade cuts through the cloth in her grip and slices her hand. She grips this shard tight, and thrusts it into the night over and over, until the monster can no longer hold of its weapon. Thick, sticky, red liquid trickles to the floor.\nSurvive.\nInside the interlayer of the mercenary's bag is the shard of a blade, something she placed in there even before she was a mercenary.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "It was a beautifully sunny afternoon years past, when the old man pushed a box before the still-young Liberi girl.\nShe hadn't even had time to wipe the soot off her face. She'd never had the finest control over firearms, though the Sankta her age used guns as naturally as their own limbs.\n'Fia. I'm not going to say 'it's just a racial gulf' or whatever to try to comfort you, and I'm not going to proclaim that wielding guns is a Sankta-exclusive glory, like SOME cardinals. Practice will yield results, and you've as good as brushed shoulders with those results, even if it's not gone how you'd want.'\n'But there's still a different way, or maybe you could say a different TOOL that could help you move forward. This box holds something one of my mechanics tutors left to me. He's not coming back to Laterano, ever. He violated the law.'\n'But, child, law is not our everything. Now don't look at me like that—yes, you might go 'big whoop,' but nobody would say our everything ends at food and water either, right? They're just things we're forced to rely on to survive. There's always something that transcends the law, sits beyond it, and everyone has a different idea of what it is. Some call it righteousness, some call it sensibility, and some call it a vague hope.'\n'Don't panic, and don't worry. There will be times when wanting to do something will make you unstoppable.'\n......\nThe Liberi is no longer a girl; she's been more places than can be imagined, and seen more sights than can be believed, but afternoons in Laterano will never change. The sun is as fine and beautiful as ever.\nThese two weapons have been by her side for longer than can be described; they have ensured her safety through danger, and mercilessly shot down the absurd aspirations of others.\nShe carefully cleans the grime from her old friends, oils them, inspects the pressure in every last piece of ammo, and affirms again and again their ordering by type. She'll soon face her pursuer, her enemy of eight years, and there's no such thing as being overly prepared.\nThere is always something that transcends the law.\nThere's no vengeance in her heart, and no pity either. Only this: what must be settled will be settled, and those who must bear the cost will pay the price. She understands—this is an obsession, nothing more.\nShe slots the final shell into her magazine.",

The journey was estimated at five days, and on the evening of day 2, she picked up on another group of mercenaries targeting the caravan. In the dark, she readied her defenses. Early morning on day 3, she noticed the single mercenary squad tracking them had become two, and a plan to flee with her life began to form in her head. On the night of day 4, the two squads launched simultaneous raids, but took each other as enemies and initiated a firefight, in the end taking everyone down. No survivors.\n......\nID tag #10, code name 'Heavy Arrow'.\nThe mission: escort refugees to a neighboring town. Mixed in with them was likely a military spy, but that had nothing to do with her. All she had to do was hold off a different mercenary group who had come for their lives. Aiming to rescue a Sarkaz child who had drifted away from the group, she spent three days and nights in a confrontation with an enemy sniper, in the end shooting them dead. When she located their position, she found the sniper she had shot was a Sarkaz too—and not much older than the child she was saving. After that, she left Kazdel.\n......\nID tag #17, code name 'Meteorite'. The final tag.\nShe was hired by some organized militia in Kazimierz to take part in guerilla combat against the Ursus Army. Unlike her former missions, the guerilla squad was as close as family. They also didn't treat her in any particular way for being an outsider, a Sarkaz mercenary. She even made a friend among them. Never do good things last forever though, and due to a defector, the guerillas took a devastating attack. When she clawed her way out of that sea of flames by the skin of her teeth, she saw her friend at her side throw a disgusted, furious look her way.\n......\nAt present, this string of tags has been handed over to Rhodes Island along with a list of names. The 'Meteorite' tag is a very unusual one, with no blood type on it, nor any squad affiliation. Just the code name, engraved in its center. On the back, a phrase is etched in the Sarkaz language.\n'May the Sarkaz never suffer again.'",

His face is stony, his build frail enough to not even seem Vouivre, and his head of red hair majorly garish.\n'I can make those guns usable, and it'd only cost you this much.'\nBoth sides seem convinced by this conservative bid, and make way for him to approach. They watch as the youngster comes up, cracks open the toolkit he keeps on him, and picks up one of the guns. The complete firearm is reduced to parts in his hands, before becoming whole again. His movements aren't fast by any measure, but nobody can tell what happened.\nThe youngster hands the bossman the assembled gun, who doubtfully accepts it. After cautiously fumbling with it, he points the muzzle at the air and pulls the trigger. A clear gunshot resounds through the whole black market.\n'It can only fire one shot. If you want it completely functional, I'll have to take it back to my workshop.'\nEveryone present was ready to slit throats a moment ago, but now all are in unanimous accord. A dozen pairs of eyes focus on the youngster, as if they've found something worth far more than the goods.\n'Boy, what did you do just now?'\n'Don't be twitchy, just hand it over and nothing bad will happen.'\nAs everyone closes in step by step, he suddenly grins and laughs:\n'You foolish philistines! Trying to get a peek of true power with your petite experience? Let me tell you, weapons have souls! Only the truly wise, the truly noble can resonate with them!'\nFor a moment, the chaotic scene once again falls quiet as can be.\n'Lunatic,' the Sarkaz spits.\nThe bossman pulls a whole pile of cash from his briefcase and hands it to the youngster, while the Sarkaz merchant takes the rest and leaves, not bothering with a single glance back.\n'Boy, you can keep your secrets if you want. I'll give you money and a workspace, and you work for me. How does that sound?' He offers an invitation to the bizarre youth.\n'Deal.'\nThe youngster takes up residence in the workroom the bossman gives him. Late at night, he carefully fills a notepad with the quantity and models of the guns from earlier that day, annotated with 'Columbian make, smuggled into Sargon by Sarkaz merchant, circumstances unclear.'\n'Good. We start from here.'",

She thinks to dig out some winter bamboo shoots to stave off her hunger, to take a few mouthfuls of snow to allay her thirst.\nThe bamboo forest is a fine place to hide, but she's not the only one who knows that. A dozen or so shinobi are in cover here, tasked with ensuring that this girl, the last survivor to escape from the purge of her family, does not remain so.\nThe bamboo leaves rustle, and the branches up high drift up and down in the wind.\nTheir tips shudder, shaking free small clumps of snow, which scatter in a slicing gust before they ever touch the ground, becoming a fine wintry mist and disappearing into the air. A few fowlbeasts on another stalk retract their necks, stuck out moments prior, and fold their wings up again, relaxing and continuing to huddle close.\nAll is still.\nThe bony girl lifts her head.\nSuddenly, a white glint.\nA dart at odds with her build flies from her hand, snowflakes and wind whirling alongside. This weapon has seen plenty of use thus far; now, it makes a clean cut yet smashes to pieces a bamboo leaf big enough to conceal someone.\nThe struck shinobi lets out a short cry, and powdery snow explodes off the layers of leaves. A trap prepared long in advance cuts off the girl's retreat. She leaps atop a branch, before being forced back by the flash of a descending blade. Her weakness from days without food catching up to her, she loses her grip on the branch, and drops like a stone. But undeterred, she looses one final arrow from her sleeve in midair.\nIt finds itself with no target to hit, but both her and the shinobi crash to the ground at practically the same time, with a dull thud. She lifts her head, and before her is a Lung dressed in black, brandishing a naginata right behind the shinobi.\n'So this is where you were, girl?'\nThe girl stares blankly, not knowing how to respond.\n'I am Fumizuki,' she says, patting the girl's head. 'Can you use a blade?'\nThe girl comes to her senses, and nods. She grasps a handful of snow from the ground, stuffs it in her mouth and swallows, draws a spare tantou from Fumizuki's waist, and charges at her enemy within the forest. Fumizuki watches this frail girl leave, and quickly follows behind.\nOne, then two. From sun overhead to horizon-laid, the shadows amidst the bamboo fall without even a chance to signal their backup. When the final shinobi uses the last of their strength to charge the girl, aiming a hidden shot straight at her stomach, Fumizuki pushes her down to avoid this fatal blow.\nOnce it's all over, a tiny body collapses in the great bamboo thicket, holding her wounds and letting out a long, slow breath.\nSunshine's rays filter through the leaves and shine on her face, the sound of fowlbeasts flapping by in her ears.\nBefore exhaustion brings her to sleep, her parents' lifelong teachings come back to her. The girl must offer her loyalty to the princess before her.",

All formed things, false.\nBut that animacy, that spiritful will, gives some ever-so-slight joy to Dusk.\nShe suddenly feels a little of her mood return.\nHalf a day later, the small being is lively across the wealth of her canvas.\n'That old idiot would have even more pointless words for me if he saw me brushing life out of nothing.'\n'But still...'\n'The way this realm has no bearing on how you are, I suppose that's a little interesting.'\n'No place of place amidst high mounts or waters far; no matter to me free amidst the human realm.'\n'That's it.'\n'I think I'll call you 'Free.''",

Yet, he had long since ceased to care about any of that. At some point, he began to talk to his staff day after day. Everyone thought he had gone insane.\nWhen he was 40 years old, he suddenly disappeared from inside the palace one day, and no one knew where he'd gone. Rumors began to spread in certain parts of Kazdel that a madman would tell certain impossible predictions to anyone who passed him by in the barrenlands. For example, that a giant beast would soon lay waste to our nation and that the sky would one day tear in two and reveal its true face. Afterward, he would peddle his watches to whoever stopped to listen, and should they refuse, he would bring their time to a halt.\nBy the time he was 100, he no longer knew where he was, but that no longer held any meaning to him. He believed he was seeking the secrets behind time itself.\nHe had the Key, but where was the Lock?\nHe had the Lock, but where was the Key?\nThe past becomes the future, and the future shall have no secrets. Day after day, he talked to his own shadow, firmly believing that the truth was hidden within.\nUntil one day, footsteps echoed throughout, as three Sankta walked into the underground palace.",

As bubbles and white smoke erupt uncontrollably out of the water, in unison with an intense searing sound, she finds herself unable to take her eyes away.\nThe cooled dagger sits atop a smithing table, and Lava herself personally etched a crude depiction of her own horns on it.\n\n'That's so sick! Miss, I want one too!'\nThe children of the slums rarely get to eat anything tasty, and they have certainly never seen the sweet treats that Lava is so fond of.\nEver since Lava removed the small, sweet-smelling pouch dangling from her waist and carefully divvied the snow-white, delicious treats evenly among all the timidly outstretched hands, the children here forgot all about the stories their parents had told them about 'Devils'. They even began looking forward to this super cool lady coming to play with them.\nWhen she sees that the animosity in the children's black eyes has faded bit by bit, from both time and her displays of goodwill, Lava finally asks a question that she's wanted to ask for a very long while.\n'Do you guys know what Arts are?'\nLava starts to manifest red, burning flowers one after another, their branches glowing beautifully under the night sky.\nThe children want to approach, but are too scared to. Lava then takes their hands and crouches down to teach them the basics of Arts.\nLava has never seen them imitate her so excitedly, and, surprisingly, she finds a few of them managing to eke out a few sparks. Their Arts may be crude and imperfect, but they certainly lit up their elated faces.\nLava decides to do something that she's always wanted to do.\nEven just for material reasons, it's a good idea to learn Arts. It helps you find a stable job and fills your stomach. You won't have to starve in the cold slums anymore. It's how you escape the fate that's haunted you your whole life.\n\nAs time goes by, one day after another, the world hasn't gotten any better. Nor has it gotten any worse. It yet fosters both misfortune and joy, as well as life and death.\nThe children here have learned the Sarkaz's Arts. They haven't become any better or worse, and they continue to live here, peacefully as ever. But their future has already started to change.\nBy passing this newly forged dagger around from one tiny, curious hand to the next, Lava is slowly changing things her own way.",

Furthermore... No! This is pissing me off!'\n'All that these 'Reunion' scoundrels are doing is getting revenge on society and making everyone even more afraid of the Infected! Professor, there is no way I can forgive them.'\nHer professor does not answer her directly.

The Infected's area of activity shall be limited to... This is what they came up with after all those meetings? Haven't they learned their lesson from 'Reunion'—Oh, I'm very sorry, Professor. And I managed to control myself so well.'\nEthelflaed lets go of the sheet of paper in a fluster. The meeting's document is once again scorched.\n'...It's really these documents' fault for being so foolish, though. Look at the ruckus the Infected are causing. How could those boneheaded lords still be cozying up to each other?'\n'Professor, I'll write them all a letter of complaint.'\n'They have to take the 'Reunion' problem more seriously and deal with it in the most effective manner. They must immediately—'\n'Uhh... It's burning again.'\n'Right. Try it one more time.'\n\n'Finally, exiled Infected are extraordinarily likely to bear a grudge and seek opportunities for revenge against the city... Phew, I'm done, Professor. I'm not particularly fond of this justification, but they don't leave me much choice. We have to put it in terms that those stubborn, short-sighted blockheads can understand.'\nEthelflaed wrote fifteen whole pages with the neatest handwriting and not the slightest scorch mark. She looks excitedly toward her professor.\n'Good.' Angst nods and takes out a letter he had written. It is addressed to a 'Rhodes Island', a name she is unfamiliar with.\n'You know the theory. You have mastered the techniques. Your studies can finally begin.'\n'You want to solve both the Infected's problems and the 'Reunion' problem...

He has only ever seen their faces on a couple of group photos.\nWhile apparently this is not at all uncommon for children born on board Rim Billiton's mining ships, it isn't something one would consider normal, either.\n\nLike many other Cautus children, the boy is very active and tends to get into trouble every now and then.\nIt might therefore be hard for those who rarely visit the library to imagine him pouring through the books on technology his father left behind.\nThe most likely source of this habit is an erudite old man with whom he is not related, who has always kept him company and reprimanded him since he was a child.\n\nWith such an unusual guardian, the boy had some perfectly natural questions for someone in his position.\nWho were his parents? How did they die?\nThe boy does actually have a vague idea. He long ago learned from the books what the equipment and instruments his father was standing next to in the photo meant.\nThe boy is much more delicate than he appears. He is worried that perhaps the reason that no one ever mentioned his father until he broached the subject is because his father had put everyone in danger with a work accident. That they avoided the subject so he wouldn't feel guilty.\n\nThe erudite old man can see that the boy has his misgivings. However, he had promised Alisha that he'd take care of her child, that he'd never let him choose the arduous path that his father once walked. That he'd never tell her child that his father spent his last moments selflessly entering collapsed caves to rescue strangers that didn't believe him, under the guise of conducting a post-Catastrophe inspection, and that he'd keep him from thinking that his father was to blame for his mother's final days in depression.\nHowever, there was one lie that the old man cannot bring himself to tell the child. He doesn't have what it takes to tell the child that his father wasn't a hero. As the ship's former Catastrophe Messenger, the old man cannot help but take pride in the young man who found himself here after being framed in Victoria, but nevertheless dedicated himself to fighting Catastrophes.\n\n'But, Alisha... Didn't you name your child Leonhardt because you were hoping he could be like his father...?'\n\nPerhaps it is the fate of his bloodline at work, but the boy could not be dissuaded from studying to become a Catastrophe Messenger. He met friends with whom he could trust his life, and he quickly earned the recognition of many of those around him.\nThat came much later, though.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "The moment she raises her crystal ball, Gitano foresees danger.\nThe squad is escorting a group of rescued Infected to Rhodes Island's transport. After the intense battle, everyone is visibly exhausted. She reminds her teammates to watch out for an ambush, but not a moment after she finishes—and before her teammates had time to react—the ambushers have already emerged from behind the boulders.\nThe very next moment, the fog that clouds the barrenland is immediately split asunder by the blinding flash of Originium Arts, forcing the ambushers to take a step back.\nIt seems casting the Arts was too much for Gitano to bear, giving her a spell of dizziness and a burning sensation at the source of her infection. 'You can't keep using your Originium Arts like that.' The advice she got from her tribespeople years ago echoes in her ear. 'Your body can't withstand it anymore. You'll fall ill if you keep casting them.'\nNonetheless, she has pushed herself to her limits in the tundra more times than she can count. With the responsibilities she shoulders, she's never been one to fear falling ill.\nSome time later, she faintly overhears two men talking in hushed voices.\n'Shh—It's okay. She fell asleep because she's tired. Her infection hasn't gotten worse. Don't worry.'\n'We have her to thank for reacting so quickly, otherwise we wouldn't have made it back in one piece.'\n'How did she foresee the ambush, though? If she's really able to peek into the future, wouldn't she also know that—'\n'Don't be stupid. She herself often says that destiny is something that can be changed.'\n'Will you really resist the guidance of fate itself?' All those years ago, her tribespeople implored her. 'We need to turn around. We don't want to leave our homeland, and we've already paid a dear price.'\nBut the young fortune teller kept leading them onward.\n\nThe Rhodes Island transport pulls out of the site with the team, after their successful rescue mission. The Elafia holds tightly onto her crystal ball as she sleeps on the stretcher. She dreams of the black forest back home and the bitter, salty snowdrops, as well as the silhouettes of the mountain chains peeking above the horizon. She's never turned around, nor can she ever go back.",

There is so much that Greyy wants to say welling up in his chest, but he's unable to muster even a single word.\nThat morning, the staff at Medical smiled as they handed him some documents to take to the Doctor's office.\nWhen he arrived with the big stack of papers, he ended up with a surprise present.\nHe hasn't had the time to process why he received this present, though—perhaps it's just psychological. He certainly feels his abilities still have much room for improvement, even if the staff he's been using is more than enough for all the Arts he knows.\nUnable to contain his excitement, he runs all the way up to the deck. The sky is so blue. The breeze blows past his hair, seeping into his throat.\nGreyy goes over everything he learned in his head. His buffs up his cheeks. His hands aren't trembling the slightest, even when he's holding onto the staff.\nThe Arts he learned from both his mother and the Rhodes Island instructors, as well as the knowledge he picked up while tending to the power facilities. He'll repay all this kindness in his own way—\nFrom freezing cold to blazing heat.\nFrom darkness to blinding light.\nHe gazes even further than his eyes can see, towards home.\nEven though he can't see any part of his homeland right now, he can feel the fragrance of it yet lingering in his nostrils. He even remembers how the abandoned Originium chunks felt when he touched them as a kid.\nHis light can now reach many more places, but the times when he sat with his father and mother in front of that small lamp are still some of the brightest memories he has.\nWhen the voltage of a staff's Arts Unit increases in an instant, the surge of the electric charges may as well be a reflection of the Caster's state of mind—From a state of disorder to one of order, they surge toward a common destination, in the end gathering in one spot and releasing a brilliant glow.\nOn the deck, the winds blowing from all directions brush his hair. With how vividly brilliant the sometimes introverted, timid boy looks this very moment, it's as though he himself, and not the staff, is letting out that radiant glow.",

The instant he turns to look in the voice's direction, he finds a crossbow bolt embedded deep into the soil, a mere inch from his feet.\n'S—Save me!' His legs go limp, and he falls to the ground.\n'If you really want to save your own life, then return what you stole.' Schwarz is stood on the rooftop, looking down on him coldly.\n'Oripathy put me out of work everywhere! I'll starve to death if I don't eat any longer!' Schwarz's eyes seem to pierce through him, and in a flash, anger overtakes him. 'You're Infected too, aren't you! Why can't you just let me go?!'\nSchwarz is silent for a moment, then gives a faint sigh. 'Because this is the only way you get to keep living. Also, if you can't find work, you can come to Rhodes Island. Give it a shot.'\nThe man is startled for a spell the moment his anger abates, already beginning to feel rueful. 'Really?' he asks, out of disbelief.\nSchwarz doesn't reply. She simply turns and leaves. She knows colleagues of hers will be there to help deal with his case.\nCome to Rhodes Island. Colleagues. She's reminded of when she'd just joined Rhodes Island, on the heels of a clash with certain others after having almost killed a target. It's almost hard for her to believe where she is now.\nRhodes Island's usual mission assignments are barely as complicated as she was braced for before she joined, but she hasn't missed people's whispers of what combat veterans like her have done before, and what they'll do again. She knows why she doesn't fall in their ranks—she joined Rhodes Island accompanying Lady Ceylon, and not out of any sort of personal belief.\nThe thing is—\nShe stops. Looks back. And sure enough, a fellow coworker is comforting the dejected youngster.\nAn Infected.\nFor the longest time, Lady Ceylon's dedication to curing Schwarz's Oripathy never really clicked with her, because she never felt her life was that important, nor did she think Oripathy was that exceptional.\nBut once she came to Rhodes Island, she realized how in a certain sense, she was honestly lucky. She'd never been treated unfairly for her own disease.\nBut no doubt, she was an Infected too.\nShe used to always accompany Lady Ceylon as she fumed, wait until she'd calmed down, and then brew her a cup of black tea. Lately, she's realized she sort of gets Lady Ceylon now.\n'Schwarz, did you catch the thief?' Just as she's barraging a local with geology questions, Ceylon sees Schwarz has come back, and waves excitedly at her.\nShe nods, and is there by Ceylon's side in just a few short leaps.\n'Schwarz, I've just heard about a group of homeless Infected banding together to attack passersby. I know we're in the field right now and it's beyond the mission's scope—could I leave it to you?'\n'Milady.'\nIt crosses her mind. Maybe I can do a little more.",

It's amazingly blunt. No lenscraft to speak of at all. Anyone can see how forced she is. After the commercial's over, whether anyone will remember the hair treatment cream is unknown, but the tail will have been undeniably close to perfection, soft and yielding with a gorgeous luster. Even the arc in which it pointed up, idyllic.\n\nProvence hasn't been a model before; she's only a Catastrophe Messenger. There's something she often hears, at least along the lines of it: 'if you can't do your best, you can only do better next time.' 'Better' signals something to compare to, and that signals regret. No one dares say whether the info one gets scrambling across and monitoring the wilds is 100% exact, whether you can get word of a Catastrophe to the epicenter in time, whether you can relay it to everyone there. Regret is part and parcel with a Catastrophe Messenger's work, and 'do better next time' is how they comfort each other. So when Provence had managed to shelter the villagers she'd just brought back from the barrens, and turned back to see a village lost under the violent storm, a village with people still into it, and she wasn't in time to save them, she could only tell herself: 'Don't blame yourself, Provence, settlements are too scattered in the wild, there's not even a comms line, you're doing this on just your own two legs, this was bound to happen... you can only do better next time.'\nThe next day, while she was resupplying at a town, she saw an engineering team. They were firm-hired, helping the local government install a local communications system, and they'd mounted electronic screens at some of the crossroads, so they could... put ads on them. Commercials worshipping quality of life bombarding people, one after another, while villagers in the wilds never even receive any life-or-death Catastrophe alert. Provence sought out the one in charge of the firm, and requested the local system extend its coverage out to the belt of surrounding wilderness. Even just a single emergency comms circuit more would do.\n'Those mucks are starving every day, and you think they can afford a hair treatment? How is this going to do anything for us?'\n'Don't give me that baloney about passing on hope. That's for you Catastrophe Messengers to worry about.'\n'Isn't there any way?' Provence knew this wouldn't work. She was just hung up on how if that emergency line existed, if things could be... that little bit faster in future. Of course she couldn't do her best, but she could do better, and 'better' signals something to compare to, and that signals there's a possibility, so it was down to her to do everything she could.\n'Did you just say your product was for hair treatment?'\n'Maybe—we can work together on this.'",

Touched your heart some more than a breeze in the woods, and my girl—girls—[CHUCKLE]—I thought to myself back then how I pretty much had two goddamn daughters. 'Aciddrop.' She was like part of our family. Like candy. Sometimes her father came, checked in on her. Gaulish man, built strong. Nothing but guilt and love in his eyes whenever he looked at his daughter. He and I drank. He said he didn't know how to be a good father. Could've said the same myself.\nUsed to figure with how our families knew each other, be one of the few fancy things in my old age, but that all changed. Overnight. Kid, uh... left two skateboards here with me. The ones I 'confiscated.' Dumped them in the junk room too. Rolled right under that army sword from Bolívar.\nI'm just an old guy. Saw these things happen before—never concerned me then. Wanted to do something... only today decided what. I know, look at me, death of a salesman. Best decision maker zero years running. Heh.\n[SILENCE]\nTaping two copies of this. Remember to send one to the kid if anyone finds her. I'll teach you how to fry onion rings for it. Secret's in the cheese.\n[SILENCE]\nThey've got the smarts to stick with their own. Not much chance I come out on top. Feel sorry for my girl. Her dad shouldn't be taking a risk like this. Makes me glad, though... I fessed up about all this and she was in tears. Gave me the go-ahead.\n[SILENCE]\nHey, kid. My daughter's all grown up now. How about you? Where you at?\nNo matter where you are, I bet you'll get along just fine.\nGangs. Hah. They gonna be scarier than the Steam Knights?

Do you wanna give it a shot?'\nI was permanently conscious about contact after my whole Oripathy diagnosis, but she grabbed straight onto my arm.\nNext thing to hit me was how my own body had gotten lighter.\nSo light I almost couldn't feel its presence anymore, and so I couldn't feel the Originium in me either. There was light shining out of her staff, Arts glittering like fireflies and circling around us, fading in and out.\nThen I realized, we were fireflies floating in the air too. The land swayed away beneath our feet, and then I couldn't see my own shadow. All I saw was nomadic cityways stretching into the distance, the lights from all the settlements flickering like fireworks.\n'Light as a feather, right? All your worries and cares floating like dust now?'\nAlong the nomadic city streets far away, the lights strung together into lines, with the skyscrapers' shadows melting into the night. I used to hurry along their walls down in the street, and the buildings always stood there being so ice-cold and mighty, but now they seemed so insignificant, distant and innocent.\n'Deep breaths, in—out.'\nMy breathing fused with the wind. We peacefully floated in the night breeze, with the wasteland sand low below us, and all the stars in the sky felt within reach.\n'—Congratulations. You've blown the dust away,' I heard the Messenger airily say.",

She imagines it'll just enable her to walk a bit faster, stand a bit longer, give her a few more days in her life of feeling the sensation of the ground with her own two legs.\nShe's not all too clear on what kind of change it can bring into her life, but she's sure it beats a wheelchair, and it'll give her a bare minimum sort of comfort during the times she can use it—she'd like to be able to stand as long as she wishes, after all.\nFraction by fraction, she installs the exoskeleton around her legs. The ice-cold metal presses against her skin, and the straps bind her weakened leg muscles tight. She gives lifting one leg a try, against the heavy frame has her all the more unable to move her feet.\nShe's spent so long unable to run now.\n'Is this really going to do anything?'\nGlaucus whispers to herself. She's not sure; she's never touched this sort of technology before.\nA few years ago, when Glaucus learned her leg muscle atrophy was caused by a hereditary disease in her family, she still had hopes she'd be lucky, thinking how maybe it could be cured, that it was only serious for a tiny fraction of her family, and she wouldn't be so unfortunate.\nYet as the days went by, Glaucus realized nothing could prevent the gradual loss of strength in her legs, and all she could do was talk herself into accepting this, how it was bound to happen to her body sooner or later.\nBut today, abruptly, with an unwavering power, the exoskeleton braces her body. Hurriedly, Glaucus seizes on this force and stands up, nervousness overcoming her, the bloodrush as her heart violently pounds causing her to take a tiny step forward.\nThen comes a second.\nA third.\nA fourth.\nGlaucus walks through the door, this physically choking emotion surging through her head, squeezing all her reason out. She has a sudden urge to run that defies everything. Even though she still hasn't gotten a hold of her balance, she feels she's gotten a miraculous hold of everything.\nThe metal is ice-cold, steel-solid, and it braces her frail legs. She runs like the wind, runs for the endless world outside.",

And I thought all along the chief would turn out to be the true mastermind! Now that I look back at previous descriptions, he did plenty that he wouldn't have done otherwise. Blatantly letting the protagonist go on with the investigation, making such a solemn vow at the meeting, and him and his wife truly being in love all along, not a political marriage... He even began by committing suicide...\nThe author's deliberately crafted narrative tricks may have had their impact, but I did still let first impressions blind me to many unusual details.\nIt may be that people truly can be affected by information from all sides given specific circumstances, and end up overlooking facts that should have been obvious.\nI've overlooked a lot, that much is true.\nThis is something I'll have to reflect on frequently in future.\n......\nI've borrowed several books from the Doctor throughout my time here at Rhodes Island. As a student, I've certainly been through things most others my age have not yet. It's beyond me to more deeply comprehend some conundrums posed in books with my current level of knowledge, but with my experiences, perhaps the author's intent is something I can feel out.\nPertinently, the passage on the 'mass' in Chashcha Lesa: 'Those who have done wrong once find they are not punished, for those around them who know of it will opt to turn one's blind eye to carry on living one's 'days of well-being,' so accordingly the wrongdoers will then go to do wrong a second and third time. May there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.'\nMay there merely be one willing to fix their firm eye and raise their voice, and this chaos can be dispelled.\n\n—Excerpts from Istina's reading notes",

The doctors say it's because of overwork and so on, so I have to recuperate, and I'm not allowed to go and look after the plants. That's why I need you to take over some of the Convalescent Garden's work. I'll write what you need to do underneath, and if you're not sure about anything, you can ask Miss Lena to teach you. I'll recover as soon as I can, so I won't keep you for too long.\nBefore I introduce the work to you, please take a look to the right of this letter. There's a pouch with floral teabags, and some tasty little snacks. They're all for you, to say thank you. Go on and have them while you read below.\n\nYour daily work will involve the following:\n1. Temperature logging and warning. Each greenhouse entrance has a terminal to control the thermoregulatory equipment. You just need to check each day if the figures are normal or not, that's all. If the equipment's giving a warning, then report it to Miss Lena as soon as possible, and she'll help you solve the problem.\n2. Operating the lighting. The Garden's lighting systems are all unified under PRTS control, so you don't actually need to worry too much, but just in case it's not working properly, you'll need to operate them manually, and adjust them into the correct positions. I've drawn detailed directions on another sheet, so make sure you look over that carefully.\n3. Plant irrigation. You can leave most of the plants alone, and the greenhouse will sprinkle them at the same times each day. The schedule should be stuck to the door, so don't go inside when that's happening. There's some other flowers too, the ones in my studio, and I'm really sorry, but all I can do is ask you to take care of them for the time being. I've labelled how much water and nutritional fluid every plant needs on their pots, so keep a close eye on the markings on the spray bottle, and don't give them too much.\n......\nThat's all I wanted to tell you. Once again, thank you for finding the time in your busy schedule to help me. If you like the presents I left you, then I promise I'll make more for you once I'm back in shape.\n\n\n—Podenco",

Earthspirit oft. sat in sidecar holding boxes of stones, following mentor everywhere on field investigations. Prof. Bachmann gifted vehicle to her at graduation, and asked her to keep a promise. At present, Prof. Bachmann is deceased. Left only this Fernand II behind, always reminding Earthspirit not to forget promise. Earthspirit rides this motorcycle on vacation, sidecar usually filled with various stones when she returns, plus other Catastrophe Messengers hitchhike on occasion.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nTO BE EXPENSED: Installation of suppressor for tuning fork\nJUSTIFICATION: Sound has been bothering people more lately. Seemingly caused by Oripathy? Require installing an inhibitor for my tuning fork.\nOVERVIEW FROM MEDICAL DEPT.: While true Earthspirit's Oripathy has grown severe, no others have heard this supposed sound she mentions. According to physical examination results, the worsening of Earthspirit's Oripathy seems to relate to her continued involuntary continuous usage of Originium Arts.\nOVERVIEW FROM ENGINEERING DEPT.: Tuning fork is Leithanian, custom-order by Earthspirit's mentor for Earthspirit. Rhodes Island requires relevant tech documentation before able to commence investigation of how to limit its output rate.\nVIEW OF ENGINEERING DEPT.: Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.\n\nLEAVE REQUESTED: Visiting home\nLEAVE PERIOD: Apr 1 TO Apr 8\nDATE OF REQUEST: Feb 24\nAPPLICANT: Glacier Wegenie\nDETAILS: Haven't returned home in a long time. I would like to visit, given relative proximity to Leithanien soon.\nVIEW OF HR DEPT.: Approved. Earthspirit was attacked by unknown assailants during a recent field mission, and is presently being treated in the Medical cabin. No adjustment of leave period required, as reconfirmed with Earthspirit. Additionally, Provence + Eyjafjalla will travel with Earthspirit, though given Provence has not returned aboard recently, we provisionally have not received her leave request.\n*Given special nature of Earthspirit's dept. plus direct superior of that dept. being the Doctor, this form to be passed onto the Doctor.",

The only thing she needs to do is let herself relax, place herself into the best possible state to be thrown into the next mission, the next battle.\nThe record is a masterpiece of the Iberian Golden Age, bought by her off an Iberian operator's hands.\nSpecter closes her eyes, lets herself sink into the sofa, and enjoys it in stillness.\nShe couldn't tell you a thing about what accomplishments marked Iberia's Golden Age, but she can sense from the music the splendor of that age, and how its people must have been so proud of their successes.\nIt's not godawful at all, she concedes.\nShe never masks her disdain for the glories of dry land's culture, but she has no intents of applying that prejudice to the arts—\nYes. Prejudice.\nShe even admits as much to the Doctor, while continuing on her merry way.\nBut her insistence isn't without meaning.\nBesides, she believes that while her and the Captain seem to have it in common, there's actually quite the distinction.\nThe Captain's arrogance comes from that good old Captain purview of Chief Designer. But she—she thinks—she doesn't care where her power comes from, and she's passionate about what undertakings she has these days. But still, sometimes she can't help but wonder—how has that statue in her hometown ended up? How about her hometown itself?\nThe music comes to a crackling halt.\nLaurentina opens her eyes, and what gradually seeps into view is her familiar ceiling. She knows, terrifyingly, she'll get even more used to this environment in time. She's not panicked about it. In order to panic in a new environment, you need to not want to leave the old one, but she's practically forgotten just how her life in Ægir felt to live.\nFrom the record box she now pulls a sawblade, and gently wipes over it, swapping for a new record to continue playing all the while. Maybe, just as the Iberians used all the methods under the sun to record their Golden Age, she can try and get back into her once most beloved activity—sculpting.\nHer one stroke of luck: she might just be stuck away from home for a good while longer. She still has enough time to remember how it looked, she thinks, with no lack of self-mocking irony.",

The child began to think.\nHe would like to mend the castle, and continue his life from before.\nBut after the witch was gone, suppose the castle were to fall apart again; whatever would he do?\n\nHe thought and thought, until finally a perfect wish came to him:\n—I want to take the castle with me, away from the forest.\n\nHence, the child set upon the journey of his—\nAnd behind him was his tiny little castle, which seemed to look very much like him, and which forever protected him.\n\n—The Child's Castle, selected from The Jeffreys Collection of Fairytales New and Old",

Family, loyalty, freedom, future, she has no clear awareness of any of it at that age. She just grits her teeth and endures training too ruthless in some measures for a child, and in her wide eyes gleams light—she wants to be what her strongest senpais are, reach the top, offer her loyalty to the lord.\nBut she doesn't know what 'offer her loyalty' means. She just knows it's an honor, it's what her parents and herself want to do, so she has to do it.\n\nA Kazemaru no longer cleaning the mud from her head again seeks out the young lord.\nShe has become the lord's shinobi. Her hair is bound beneath her hat, her nails orderly trimmed, and missions arrive secretly one after another from the bamboo tubes into her hands. Kazemaru pulls out the scroll inside, and silently looks over. The name she has no recognition of written at the top of that scroll is about to silently lose everything he originally possessed, all before a single fowl is startled.\n'Well done.'\nSo the lord often commends her, but while in hiding, she hears a mother in another courtyard scolding her crying child: 'Keep crying, and the people in black will take you away!'\n\nThe young lord looks at his employee whose head is covered in mud.\nShe changes out of the black bodysuit, and will no longer receives scrolls in bamboo tubes. The old lord has passed, and Kazemaru has a new outfit.\nThe meeting room isn't secret, but it's cramped and inaccessible; contracts fly back and forth in the open, but it's all too smooth and steady. As the days wear on, Kazemaru flexes her stiffened spine at her office desk, joints chafing with a 'krrk,' and the last time she heard that noise, it was like a hidden weapon scraped at her bones.\nShe doesn't like sitting, nor becoming one of the 'people in black' which that mother had tried to spook her child with.\nThis isn't what she's meant to do. This isn't what she likes to do. She wants to do actual good work. She doesn't want to neglect her skills like this. She wants a new way out, but she still hasn't found the full resolve to take the step.\n\nThe young lord reaches out, brushes away the grime caking Kazemaru's pale hair, and hands her a contract termination, along with a business card for Rhodes Island.\nOne time when returning from work, an unsteady flowerpot was blown into the air, crumbs of soil and leaf fragments flying out to form a graceful arc, and the planter compacted with soil plummeted down and crashed straight onto Kazemaru's head.\nHead covered in soil and ceramic chips, Kazemaru was struck awake—she needed to leave. She had to leave.",

Whenever he did, he did so for the whole day. Jordi had carefully chosen his position, and watching from this angle at sunset, the sinking sun in the west would line up with the tip of the lighthouse for the briefest moment, like this tiny little lighthouse too had come alight.\nRegrettably, it was a fleeting scene, and in the span of a few short breaths, the lighthouse statue would once again go out. Everything about it would be rapidly shrouded in shadow, engulfed by darkness. What he had just witnessed was much like an illusion, gone without a trace.\nFortunately, the sun would rise as it did before the next day, and the lighthouse would come alight again. Just for a moment, of course.\nOn the day of his ninth birthday, Jordi decided to do something big. He wanted to grab hold of something more lasting. He'd try and see for himself what the town's elder workers were so proud of yet kept so secret, see for himself the colossal structure the parents he'd never met had disappeared in, see for himself that true 'Eye of Iberia.' Jordi began to climb the statue in the plaza, believing as long as he stood on its top, he'd be able to see the true rays of the lighthouse piercing through the fog. He clambered inch by inch, hearing the passersby in the plaza shrieking frantically, but the top was right there before him, he just had to make one final leap...\nJordi suddenly felt himself falling—the protrusion he'd used as footing likely crumbled—but why he was falling was no longer important. Jordi had struggled so he could cast his sight far away. Even if it was only for a split-second, he wanted to see it.\nNothing. There was nothing. The fog was like a gauze, covering all upon the surface of the sea.\nWhen Jordi came to, he was already back at home, his leg bandaged, the scent of meat porridge pervading the room. Hearing the sound of Jordi turning over, Thiago poked his body out of the kitchen. Jordi thought he'd be in for a ferocious scolding, but Thiago simply stared at him for a moment, let out a sigh, and pointed in the direction of the desk. There was laid a spyglass, glittering in alluring bronze.\nThat was a bygone affair, years and years ago, and now the scar has even faded. Only the small town's plaza seems to have been overlooked by time, resting unchanged. Jordi sits in his younger self's most favorite spot. Now he's seen the true Eye of Iberia, yet he can no longer sit on this bench with his uncle, listening to those heart-racing stories, taking turns at the spyglass through which they'd gaze far away.\nBut even with the help of a spyglass, they still couldn't see anything. It was the one thing the two of them silently, tacitly, never mentioned to each other.",

The student shuts her book.\n'—Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\n'Ceylon Doykos. Elevated BOCD, no signs of Oripathy.'\nThe three let out a collective sigh. 'See!' the student starts to tell the other woman in excitement. 'I'm fine, Professor!'\n'More like you're lucky,' the professor replies sternly, shaking her head.\n'I've warned you two before. Outdoor investigations are to be carried out within stipulated safe regions, during designated times, and proper protective measures have to be taken. Without specialized protective gear, coming into contact with highly activated Originium is exceedingly dangerous. Moreover, we have no right to extract ore from the mines. The mines can hold you liable for anything you've done. Ceylon, you're supposed to be a model student.'\n'But I want to verify the theories I see in my textbooks... and besides, if I hadn't warned Mr. Davis and the others to halt their work, there would've been an acute infection incident. I couldn't—'\n'What if you'd judged wrong?'\nCeylon stops in her tracks. After a moment, she droops her head. 'Sorry.'\n'I'm not expelling you, but you will have to retake this course,' says Ceylon's professor says as she gets up from the bench. 'It was only your first field outing. Be mindful of properly protecting yourself in future.'\n\nOnce the professor has left, only then does the mine-worker nervously move to say a word of thanks.\n'Thank you for saving us. I don't know if we've burdened you... Your professor sounds like she thinks you did the wrong thing.'\n'No, not at all,' Ceylon replies with a smile.\n'I know what my professor thinks. She just has to teach me these things as part of the course. I need to know fear, and the worst case, and I have to weigh whether the responsibility's something I can take.'\n'It's when I learn all that that I can truly make my own choices.'",

We all muttered how it was some devil's witchcraft silently spreading about, and so we all kept our houses tightly shut. But we didn't have the heart to throw a single frail woman back into the wild in the rainstorm, so we agreed to let her in.\nShe first moment she laid eyes on Veitch, she sensed something was wrong. She was prudent as we worked through his symptoms with her, and she asked how the village at large was doing, before revealing herself to be a roving doctor.\n'This is no Originium Arts; it's an illness. The soil and wellwater is contaminated, and the children are the first to be sick; as the poisoning builds up over time, the adults will come to show symptoms too.'\nShe opened her suitcase, and mixed a medicine with practiced hands. As she did, she spoke. 'I'm sorry. All I can give myself is a temporary first aid, but the only way to cure an illness such as this is to be away from the contamination's source, and convalesce through medication in the long-term. If possible, I'd ask you to tell all the village that they should move away from here.'\n'But this is our home,' my husband said with worry. 'Even if this soil will harm us, where are we going to shelter if we leave here?'\nThe doctor said nothing more. She worked in simple silence.\n\nThe weather had cleared up the next day, and I found the doctor just as she was about to leave. On the door was stuck a wild flower, a kind that grew anywhere. In that instant, a faint memory of someone seemed to match with her in my head.\n'I remember you, doctor. I've met you before.'\n'I was still in a small town on the outer edge of a nomadic city. You'd make home visits to everyone, and you always secretly handed out fresh flowers to us children... I was behind the curtains watching, I remember seeing from there.'\n'That was decades ago by now. My mother caught Oripathy, see and we were driven out... and I've gone from a child to a married woman now, I know you wouldn't recognize me. But, well, you look about the same now, compared to all the way back then.'\nI told her how grateful I was for her, from the bottom of my heart, for she cured me of my fever when I was young, and now she'd saved my own child too. Yet the look on her face was at first blank, then became so sorrowful, as if she was close to weeping.\n'No, please... don't go on any further. Just treat me as though I'd never visited before.'",

It was only a little thing I bought while carrying out a mission in Yan, but the local said it'd been blessed at the temple. Someone tells me I can go and ask Purestream. Purestream... I'm not too familiar with the name. Maybe it's a new operator handling lost and found at Logistics?\nIt's not in my dorm...\nOr the meeting room...\nI find her at the baths. She's just finished repair work, and now she's—well, bathing. I can even hear her singing from outside the door. It's loud, clear and perfect... but don't you feel icky bathing for that long?\n'Sorry, sorry, I know I kept you waiting.'\n'Rhodes Island's sewage work is up to the task, but they've really been overlooking cleaning the filtration system itself. The vast majority of areas have blockages. You need to get into them frequently! All I can do is hang on until the whole cleaning job's done before I... heheh.'\n'Is this your charm? Come and take a look.'\nThe girl absentmindedly talks as she opens a bag. Aside from my talisman, I can see marbles, hair clips, test tubes, and even an ammo magazine...\n'Did you... find all of these in the sewage filtration system?'\n'Yup. It was covered in mud when I found it, absolutely filthy, but I've already thoroughly cleaned it.'\nI'm about to ask 'how could it have gotten there,' but I hold it back. I should be asking myself that...\nLater, I'm chatting with a friend in Engineering about the landship breaking down and getting repaired. Nobody would've called the problem being the sewage systems. Operator Purestream took on the cleanup task all alone after only a day of her job, and she'd spent two whole days inside the filthy inner filtration system... blockages in a few specific areas were the 'main culprits,' all the 'treasures' we'd accidentally lost and couldn't find. I remember Purestream sort of shyly smiled when I told her thanks, and she just urged me to 'take care from now on,' giving me a precautions while she was at it. Water could flush everything away, so we'd gotten used to just twisting taps and pushing on valves, simple as that. It was precisely because water could flush everything that we never knew how dirty it'd gotten, somewhere out of our sights.\nI hear Purestream's in charge of Rhodes Island landship sewage work now. I didn't know what she liked, so all I could figure was to buy some scented soap and send it to her. I only found out later she'd gotten piles of it by that point. I guess I wasn't the only one who wanted to tell her thank you.\n\n—As related by an operator, extracted from a periodic evaluation of Purestream following her onboarding",

Could be doing WORK here... If someone's my disciple, they're worth educating. She learned how to test microcapacitor unit performance and then straight away, she managed to fumble a whole breadboard together! She's gifted! Really resembles me there! And she's hardworking. Read through every single engineering book the landship has over the past half year, and she finds people to discuss with everywhere. They don't put half of the true might of technology to print, though. She's got a lot more to learn. As for why she's so eager, well, don't ask me. Probably hasn't scooped her jaw up from the floor since she landed on Rhodes Island... She's had two sorta major awakenings in her life, right? First was seeing a nomadic city pass by with her own eyes when she was a kid, second was seeing a talking Lancet-2 in Acahualla. I can see the hopes in her, for machines, for herself. There's a possibility in there... in the not-distant future, I bet she'll be able to build machines with her own two hands that surprise even herself. Maybe her creations will lead Terra in technological innovation. I might just hand my Chief Engineer position to her when the time comes, it's not out of the question...

That little yellow flower! I never knew flowers that pretty could grow in the extreme north, all the way in the ice deserts! It's unbelievable, really.\nYou suggested I should 'join the next exploration project as a supporting surveyor,' right? I've given serious thought to it. Not whether to go or not—I still have to stay on the landship at this stage so I can get Oripathy treatment. It's what help I would be if I did go. Mayer's said how under extreme cold conditions, your Soaring Dragon drones get their stability affected. I minored in research filming while I was studying at Ironforge Polytechnic, so I tried installing a set of production lenses on my shield, so it could handle photography and data storage roles at certain temperatures. I should be able to take my shield through more special terrain, compared to using drones, and use it for fundamental defense work. It can sort out the issue of stability, too.\n......\nMaggy, I admire you, with all my heart. While everyone only has the barest imagining of what such faraway places are like, you've gone deep into them, gotten a taste of all this fascinating scenery, felt the pulse of life. I once went with a survey group into the northern icefields and saw the aurora, and that was when I learned a really important lesson in life: not every place has snowy peaks like Kjerag, and protection like Kjeragandr's, but every place has its own beauty you can't explain with common sense. The Black Flow forests, the Ringed Plains with mountains all around... all these extreme landscapes have nothing to do with the supernatural, really. They're part of Terra in themselves. I can't help but wonder, just how—shallow and narrow everything we know and hear and think and believe about this great land is.\nI want to see the aurora again more than anything else. I want to go and see the ice deserts. Not so I can prove anything—just because, well, 'I want to go and see.' Master SilverAsh is write. If we want to protect Kjerag, then we have to know just what kind of world it is we live in.\nWe can only better defend the homeland behind us if we're brave enough to explore onward. And besides, I have this sort of feeling, like the ice deserts, the poles, all these places full of hidden secrets far away already have a lot of eyes watching them... \nSo once I'm ready, Maggy, you can be sure I'll submit my application to the Doctor.\n......\nI eat... a little bigger, and I sleep more as well, but you don't need to worry, I promise. When it comes work time, I'll get down to it, believe me. I'm sure I'll be able to help you out.\n\n—Extract from comms logs sent to Operator Magallan by Operator Aurora",

The instant he says it, he regrets it. But Iris isn't upset in the slightest, but instead conscientiously asks: 'Why is that?'\n'I heard a fairytale, growing up in Victoria. About a witch wandering the land, filching children's most precious things, locking them away in a castle in the woods... Of course, never to return. The collection fills the witch's empty heart, but the children carry their regret and resentment into adulthood.\nIt scared me like you wouldn't believe. All night I clutched the necklace my mother made for me for my birthday, a beautiful little pentagram. The witch never took that though. Instead, she took my mum, my dad, my entire village... Catastrophes from nowhere, flames of war that never went out... Miss Iris, there's no castle like you say, not in Victoria, not even in fairytales.'\nFinally, Joaquin asks: 'Miss Iris, did you leave anything of yours to the castle, when you were young?'\nIt's a difficult question to answer, and Joaquin knows it. It's like asking a magician if their head really does come off from their body. If little creatures really do come out of their hat. Those who create Dreamland exist detached outside of it, they don't believe in it. She could easily lie, of course, and tell you she believes.\n'It was the castle itself,' Iris says with almost no hesitation. 'I dreamt of it when I was quite young. It was grand, full of different rooms, each one filled with towering cupboards, all specially made. They could lock away time itself, and nothing would ever rot or fall apart inside... And because of that, I'd never lose anything beloved to me ever again. After I awoke, Grandmother made that castle I dreamt of into a pop-up book, and I kept it safe. Later on, she took me to the castle, and shockingly, it was exactly as both my dream and the book. And that book went into the very first shelf of the very first room. It was then that she asked me, you know, if I'd be willing to serve as the castle's master, and bring help to all the children.'\nJoaquin is sure Iris isn't lying; he's confident in his observations after being with Rhodes Island for so long. Even if what she says is so... unimaginable. She doesn't think herself a cheap conjurer—she *is* the creature in the magic trick, dwelling in the realm of fairytales. Joaquin supposes that's why the children aboard all trust her. As he speaks, his hands are still busy helping her stow away the sweetie boxes and toy models by size.\n'Sorry for bringing up something so pointless, Miss Iris.'\n'Your necklace there...'\nJoaquin looks down at the silver star nestled in his chest, now tarnished into an entirely different color over the years.\n'Mr. Joaquin, you are your own Castle.'",

      "uniEquipDesc": "When Indigo was still newly arrived on Rhodes Island, we conducted a study on her staff. The unit at its head seemed to be the key to its function, but we could find no clear theory underpinning it. During further studies, new Operators Irene and Lumen—who had visited Engineering to undergo equipment certification—coincidentally passed by, and the latter took one look at Indigo's staff and very confidently told us that he had seen something similar in the 'Eye of Iberia.' The 'Eye of Iberia' is a lighthouse... a series of lighthouses along Iberia's coastal towns, a grand project that once illuminated the whole nation, abandoned altogether after a disaster decades ago, and now a legacy of the age. Indigo's teacher was one of those very lighthouse keepers, and it was he who gave her the staff as she left home.\n'The unit at her staff's head is a standard installation in Iberia's lighthouse systems.' This much should be more or less accurate. The issue was that, based on her account, her teacher protected the Rocky Coast's lighthouse all his life, hoping it would one day shine anew. So why would he give her something so important and then allow her to leave?\nIndigo herself had this to say: 'I'm sure my teacher wanted me to gain some experience on the outside, unravel the secret of its technology, and let it come to life once again... He really was mindful!'\nMeanwhile, Irene stated: 'Will Iberia's lighthouses never shine again without those Ægir relics? Iberia's prosperity should be left up to the Iberians themselves this time.'\nIndigo and Irene's answers undoubtedly represent two different outlooks held by the modern Iberian on the nation's future, and deserve some consideration. However, once they had both left, Lumen raised an alternative, 'small-minded' conjecture, more or less that before an old man sends his granddaughter off to the city, he stuffs the only valuable they own into her suitcase and hopes she'll never come back, or that he'll have passed by the time she does... or thereabouts.\n'The elderly are like that. They like to decide everything for you while you're still clueless,' Lumen added.\nSpeculating on an old man's intentions seemed unnecessary. Besides, having ascertained the history of her Arts unit, our investigation into Indigo was complete. And, of course, it would never have affected how welcome she is at Rhodes Island. But we will note that upon learning the staff's origins, Indigo went blank for a moment. As for what thoughts she had in that instant, and what decisions she made, we have no way of knowing.",

Her departure had been too rushed to take nearly any personal items. And they should have cleaned out her office long ago. So why save these? Why send them to Rhodes Island? And why now?\nA few days ago, at the intervention of the Maylander Foundation, construction ceased on dozens of unlawful experiment sites. Certain people had bribed officials in the municipal planning department to circumvent the necessary auditing procedures, and used fabricated plans to deceive the ethics review committee. Business as usual. Saria had spent months on the move to find evidence of their illegal dealings—fortunately she'd gotten ahold of Anthony Simon, along with his sources. Ultimately, over half of the test sites shut down had belonged by Rhine Lab. Maybe that was why these boxing gloves turned up now. A warning, or even a reminder.\nThey were hardly the first boxing gloves she'd ever owned. Those would be the ones her father gave her, clearly unfit for a child, which always chafed her skin to the point of bleeding. But she persisted and did as her father told her, pounding her weakness into a sandbag, along with all her *impractical* emotions, punch by punch. Others had minds filled with openings, so one moment of complete disarray was all she needed to shatter their defensive line in a single punch. Saria was never as enamored with fighting as so many other boxers were: for her the skill was simply a means to survive until now.\nUnconsciously, her fingers read the ridged words along the back of the gloves. 'Trimounts Institute of Technology'—she'd once taken part in an intercollegiate tournament with these. She spent many a late night in the boxing club back then, always with a plus-one tagging along. That certain someone wasn't a fan of the sport, nor was she interested in the tournament, but hung around simply because 'varying your environment prevents your mind from getting stuck in certain lines of thought.' She wasn't joking: not much later she proposed the concept of a hand-mounted exoskeletal operating system, based on observation of Saria's own movements. That system was still in use to this day, in the office of Rhine Lab's Control.\nThough they hadn't seen use in so many years, the gloves looked as snug as ever. Saria very nearly put her hands in them, but a slight ache from beneath her shoulder blades held her back—apparently a call to adjust the dosage of her painkillers. The mercenaries outnumbered her in her last investigation, after all: a whole platoon against one .\nIt meant she was gradually getting close to the truth.\nA few minutes later, Saria let go of the gloves, stowing them in the lowest drawer of her temporary desk, and once again picked up Ifrit's latest physical report.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "Truth be told, Kowal has a dream. He'd already made the kid's come true.\nOnce, Maria was viewing her ancestor's portraits by Margaret and Auntie Zofia's sides, listening to them tell legends of Kazimierzian knights of old. She lifted her head and asked her sister: 'Is the armor they wear the same as yours?'\nMargaret smiled and shook her head.\nThen Maria asked: 'What about the sword?'\nUnable to hold back a laugh, Zofia decided they'd pay a visit to Kowal's knight workshop while the weather was still good.\nThat afternoon, Maria saw Master Kowal hard at work in his shop. He was always a friend to his friends, and on occasion boisterous too.\n'If a knight's honor really be measured in a crown, then that crown's going to be made by the Craftsman's Guild,' Kowal laughed, as he picked Maria up.\nMaria didn't mind the smell of iron at all. She watched the delighted expressions flit across her sister and aunt's faces as they looked over the weapon, and her eyes shone brilliantly.\nLuckier still, she just so happened to be deft at the very thing she was interested in, which raised her spirits.\n'She's a jack-of-all-trades, I tell you,' Kowal said, wiping the foam from his mouth. 'Say, remember when we were holding that lone city out on the plains? Remember all that work the old one-eyed boy from the blacksmith's got up to, and we thought he was just some nobody? If it weren't for him, we'd have caved before reinforcements arrived!'\n'Of course I remember! How could I forget!' The old knight's face was aglow at the mention of tales of the past, and even his own drunkenness slipped his mind. 'But what're you saying? Maria could match that, no contest!'\nKowal would normally have fired a retort at his old friend out of habit, but as that stretch of the past washed over him, and he remembered the brothers-in-arms they'd lost, he fell quiet. His silence said enough though, and V took a swig of his drink before lowering his voice. 'What d'you think of her, that Maria girl?'\n'Me?' Kowal came back to his senses, went briefly blank, then let out a huge grin. 'If Maria'd been around back then, holding the city would've been nothing. Could've even counterattacked! And done it damn well.'\nV said nothing. He simply returned his own grin.\nFor the banished Margaret had come to mind.\nMaria had cried for days and nights, even wailing about how she'd go find her sister herself. It was Zofia who soothed her to sleep, and kept her company at home.\nKowal loathed himself for doing an awful job of protecting the Nearl family, and was ashamed of what old man Kirill might've thought. All these years, he'd hardly done any work himself.\nRust. Creeping across the surface of this radiant, beautiful city. Yet the old boys could hardly do a thing anymore.\n'I'd give anything to hear those lively sounds a-banging away again. We need that girl's hands...' Kowal mumbles to himself.\n'...Too much to drink, methinks?'\n'No, like this, you see.'\nKowal sidesteps the question and gesticulates with his hands, as if he's holding a hammer, and the scene outside the tent's a thousand miles of grassland lapping at the white clouds, and the lumber and the stones pile up high amidst the sounds of knocking, forming a grand castle.\nClank—\nRinging through the air.",

The coat of arms on her chest is completely scratched off, but the medic, who's trudged across more lands than most, can tell it is of Kazimierzian make.\n'Is your companion resting?' asks the knight softly, her voice filled with apology. 'It truly weighs on me that she should be so frail, yet use her Arts to rescue me. I hoped to be of service to you in some way, which is why I came back.'\n'Please, sit,' answers the medic.\n'No, allow me to be your sentry,' says the knight.\nHer hands grip her warhammer as she stands calm yet firm at five paces out. Her armor is speckled with blood, too; mere hours ago in these twilight wastes, she fought tooth and nail against mercenaries plundering a caravan, the radiance of her Arts nearly enough to convince one that the sun had risen anew. Now, those golden rays merely float about her weapon and body, indistinct. She professes herself to be Infected, afraid of neither the mercenaries' Oripathy, nor of giving her own life.\n'Do you still believe we shouldn't dissuade you?' asks the medic. 'Even though you know full well that despite felling a team of hired soldiers, the mercenary powers camped nearby will continue plundering wherever they please.'\nA lengthy silence. The knight turns her head. The slow rise and fall of the pale-white Sarkaz's chest as she holds her staff, her frail limbs pierced by fine and pointed Originium crystals.\n'I'm sorry, I simply... Perhaps I'm still not used to this.' Finally, she lowers her gaze. 'An insurmountable foe, incurably terminal... It wasn't you I was angry at, back then.'\nHer helpless indignation burns silently in the dark of night. The medic recognizes the naivety in those eyes, those familiar flames not knowing where to burn, that were inevitably snuffed out, one after another, in the misery of the battlefield.\n'I believe that... your willingness to act in defense of others, has sufficed.' She prods the bonfire with a branch, and speaks again with a nod to the knight. 'Please, come and sit. You won't wake up Liz.'",

      "uniEquipDesc": "\tEvery day at half past six, Hung turns on the TV and begins to prep the day's dinner to the tune of a wuxia drama's deathblows and battlecries. There were tremendous lines at the hypermarket today, and it's already past seven by the time he gets back, with the wuxia on TV long since over. But he leaves it on out of habit anyway, and shuffles over to the kitchen to cook.\nThe meat's red and tender; Hung decides he'll mince it and mix in fresh spring onion, planning to fill two tiers of buns. With the meat neatly stacked on the cutting board, Hung picks up a kitchen cleaver in each hand and assumes the Meat-Chopping Stance, when suddenly a mournful wail comes from the living room TV.\n'You've fallen into my hands, Zhong Dafa! You know your blood debt. It's time you finally repaid me!'\nThe cleaver drops with a bang, not into the meat, but straight into the cutting board. Hung shakes his ears—he only hears intermittent gasps and sobs. With no clue about what's going on, he continues the work at hand. A short while later, he tosses the filling into a bowl, and is just about to pour in a few drops of sesame oil when—\n'Stop, Dacai! You can't kill him! The truth is, he's your brother!'\n'Huh?' Hung abruptly lifts his head in disbelief, face blanketed with confusion, beginning to suspect he just heard wrong. More voices immediately follow. \n'Ma, how can that be? I don't believe you!'\n'When I divorced your ba, we each took a child. We never thought it would lead to a mess like this.'\nHung wrinkles his brows, screws the lid of the bottle of sesame oil tight, only to let way too much of the oil out, adding to the bowl of mincemeat the smell of high heaven of sesame. He heaves a sigh and lays the rolled-out pieces of dough in his hand to wrap the buns, all while his ears stand attentively pricked, as if hoping to catch whatever audible clues the television might make next.\n'Hmph. No need to hesitate, Zhou Dacai. Just do it.'\n'Ma, what do I—what do I do...'\nThe buns he is pleating shut are incredibly lopsided, and he finally stops what he's doing and devotes his full attention to the ensuing conversation. Unfortunately, however, someone seems to have changed the channel, and the TV is now playing video game noises, with Waai Fu and Aak's clamorous voices reaching Hung's ears soon after, followed shortly by the sound of Lee coming in. Hung shakes his head and smiles, and places the uniquely shaped buns inside the already-boiling steamers.\nThe clock's hour hand has been on eight for a while now, and Hung gently uncovers the steamers, the clouds of billowing steam revealing the plump white meat buns before him, as the filling's scallion scent slyly wafts from the kitchen and spreads through the living room, subconsciously luring the people towards it and the table.\nThere'll always be people who say eight o'clock in Lungmen is for the eight o'clock sitcoms, but Hung knows what eight o'clock is truly for—the little round dining table, with his folks sat huddled in a circle.",

She's going to put lots of sweet, sweet honey inside them, with extra jam and fresh, crunchy nuts. She's decided she's going to make them really big, and share them with all the people she loves. That way, everyone can eat to their heart's content, and every bite will be super sweet.\nWhat could possibly beat taking what you love, and sharing it with who you love?\n............\n'Let's get our stuff ready to move, Lada. It's gotten bad. We can't stay in the school any longer.'\nOn hearing what Sonya says as she enters the classroom, Lada hops to it without needing to think, following her leader with not a moment's hesitation.\n'Sure, I'll pack everything now.'\n'Hold on, Lada.' Anna, to her side, calls her to a halt and hands her half a honey spice cake. 'You should eat something too. Essentially all of the school's food has been torched. We're lucky you were concealing this spice cake in the first place...'\n'Hell of a big one, too! And sweet!'\nRosalind laughs boisterously from behind Sonya, followed by Natalya joining in the praise. 'Just a single bite silences the hunger. We were blessed to have you, Lada.'\n'Damn right,' Sonya nods, before furrowing her brow and addressing her directly, 'but you're barely eating anything. You've just been splitting with the rest of us. Didn't you share your cookies with some other guys too?'\nEat some more, Lada. They practically push the food into her hands.\nLada cups half a spice cake in her hands, not daring to blink, and turns to face away from the other girls in the room.\nThe Little Cub sniffles as quietly as she can, squeezing out the tears in her eyes and wiping them away. She presses her cracked lips together and lifts the spice cake up. She mimes a small biting motion, her teeth carefully shaving just a tiny bit from the top, the smallest possible bit of pastry and filling, and holds it in her mouth.\nSo sweet.\nHow can something be so sweet? She's never had a spice cake so delicious before.\n'Alright! I took a biiig, big bite!'\nLada turns back around, stuffing the spice cake into her bag and meeting the girls' concerned gazes with a smile.\n'It's true! I put lots and lots of honey in when I made it! Now I'm ready to go, I'm not hungry at all anymore!'\nAs long as she can be with the others, the Little Cub thinks to herself, no matter what she does, she won't have to suffer, or get tired, or fear anything ever again.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "The Reefsteep Black Market, where I was born anew.\nAt the end of the western passage, one can see the land and the sky. Once, it was an arms dealer's territory. I worked under him in my first few years in this place. He was a born despot. He left several welts on my back, but I've no hate for him. It was only natural, just as it was only natural that his irate underlings slit his throat in drunkenness, before throwing him from a cliff. I placed my first gold coin in those turncoats' hands, and it was warm to the touch.\nThe northern oasis, Reefsteep's border. For a time and an age, the favored turf of the mercenaries. Soldiers were replaced batch by batch, but there was only ever one leader. My biggest customer, and the one who taught me how to taste wine. But that winter, he died. He died in front of my storehouse, his body bruised and battered. He coveted my creations, and died to my precautions. Mercenaries keep no loyalty, and thus I rewarded his subordinates at his funeral. Unfortunately, his life couldn't even buy a decent bottle of wine.\nThe southern side, where the towns sit. Messengers and merchants come and go in spades, the value they trade in circulating through the villages. The lords recognize as much, hence why Ibut's lord ameer had such a special fondness for the place. Sargon's unbearably chaotic, barbaric politics never interested me, but I needed the lord's support. The division of powers within the Reefsteep Black Market bored me so much I'm loathe to mention it, but we all had something to say when it came to the lord. I'm surprised that I held such frail relations for so long; a lord that doesn't judge by the cover, perhaps? Out of respect, I didn't personally attend the revolt. But once his family were puppets, I did show up to pay respects to that poor boy—he was akin to Elliot. Akin to me.\nThe Reefsteep Black Market's center. An old tomb lies there, an ancient pasha's grave. Every night, Isin carefully wipes his memory under the light of the stars. A long time ago, I exhausted his wealth. And by now, I've repaid him several times over, but he doesn't pay any mind. His age looms by the day, and aside from a few errant, insignificant questions, we never even speak.\nThat day, Old Isin asked me why others call me 'Sand Soldier.'\n'Sand Soldier.'\nThe meaninglessness of a grain of sand. The pathetic fate of a pawn. The term is filled with significance I abhor.\nHence why I gladly accepted it. As a price paid in advance, for the impossible trial to follow. The Reefsteep Black Market had its towns, and they were fuel ready for the fire.\nI waited for the lord ameer of Ibut to come. If I could, I would have burned even the golden sands to nothing.\nAnd in the final moment before I set the flame alight—\n—what came to mind was the afternoon a young Elliot Glover was taken to tour an institute of science, where he sees a new model of Originium engine ignite and combust, upon which a tremendous machine stirs to life. He's always remembered how much that moved him.\nI've always remembered.",

      "uniEquipDesc": "Skadi has dreamt a dream.\nOf an abnormally beautiful view, a night sky vast as the sea, as if its reflection. Points of infinite stars, like the lights in the abyss. The air moist, too moist, so much so that it bears her with ease. A mere reach, a wave of the hand, and her body floats up, weightless. People, so many people, arms spread wide, roaming through the night, freed and at peace.\nSkadi does not swim into the sky. She is sat on the shore, silently watching the scene before her, gentle waves at times caressing her boots. Her sword, ever her companion, rests by her side. On the other, there sits a girl dressed in a red dancer's dress. She wears a broad hat, behind which Skadi cannot see her face. She has hair as soft and white as her own, and so Skadi feels she is close, familiar. Like any other dream, this one has no beginning. By the time she realizes she's dreaming, she is already sitting there.\nThe girl in red speaks. 'Are you a hunter?' she asks, voice ineffable and captivating.\n'Yes.'\n'Do you like to hunt?'\n'I can't say I like it. But terrifying creatures are always threatening my kin. Someone has to fight them.'\n'To defend your kin's lives, you must hunt other races?'\n'Possibly. Maybe.'\n'But then, why can we not all become kin?' the girl asks, sincere.\n'Is everyone kin, where you are?' Skadi replies.\nThe girl seems to ponder carefully for a while, then nods.\n'We don't need to hunt each other, in the place I am.'\n'Then what do you normally do?'\n'I do nothing. I sing.'\n'It sounds like your home is more peaceful than mine.'\n'It is just as you see now.'\nThe girl extends a slender finger, pointing far away. At the edge of vision, the line separating sea from sky is given a formless end. All life blends together, no difference, no distance.\n'Goodbye. I have to go.' Skadi takes her sword and stands.\n'Are you going to hunt?'\n'I have to wake up. Once I do, yes. I'll carry on hunting.'\n'I hope that one day, you can be free of this destiny.'\n'If possible.'\n......\nWhen Skadi dreamt this dream, she had not yet left Ægir. And like many other dreams, it became a fragment of a memory, buried deep in a corner of the waves of her mind. And when she dresses in that red dancer's dress in Sal Viento, that memory remains silent.\n'Now I look nothing like a hunter.' Skadi stares at herself in the mirror, murmuring.\n'Who are you, right now?'",
