[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Some regions have seen large-scale engagements with hostile forces called <@tu.kw>Annihilation Operations</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_amiya")] Yes, that's right. If you're able to perform well in these battles, you'll be able to greatly reduce the enemy's operational strength.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] Right now, we need you to personally command these important battles.

Please feel free to experiment.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] After an Annihilation operation, rewards will be given based upon the number of enemies defeated.
[Tutorial(target="panel_campaign_info",           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] The more enemies you defeat, the better your milestone rewards will be.
