[name="Dobermann"]   The situation is only going to get more chaotic from here on out.

[name="Amiya"]   That is, assuming everything goes according to plan.
[name="Dobermann"]    It'd be nice if things went that smoothly.
[name="Dobermann"]    Today is our last opportunity to get you out of here, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Dobermann"]    But... I have a bad feeling about this.

[name="Amiya"]   This way, we'll have an edge in battle.
