[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#1")]
[name="Leonhardt"]Hm, I've done disaster monitoring work for these two companies before, so you could say we know each other well enough.
[name="Leonhardt"]They were very helpful too. They prepared all the equipment we needed for the environmental survey and assigned guides to us for the entire trip.
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#6")]
[name="Leonhardt"]It's when we had to sign the contract that they started to give us a little trouble. They wanted all these additions and annotations. I didn't know how to deal with that at all.

[name="Amiya"]Instructor Dobermann, maybe we should explain the situation to the Doctor first.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#1")]
[name="Dobermann"]Doctor, you can think of this as Rhodes Island expanding into a new business vertical.
[name="Dobermann"]We've received a lot of requests to provide security support from various companies, such as the Toron and Iron Carrot Mines that Ceylon and Leonhardt conducted surveys on.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#1$1")]
[name="Ceylon"]Toron Mine is one of Count Vincent's many businesses. The area around County Toron is pretty busy, and the rioters seized an opportunity to take over the mine.
[name="Ceylon"]On the other hand, Iron Carrot Mine, under the banner of the Rim Billiton Mining Industry Association Security Company, accidentally destroyed an Originium Slug nest and was forced to shut down its operations because of the ensuing pollution.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#3")]
[name="Dobermann"]It's a similar story for all the other companies. They need to restore operations ASAP, but they don't have enough security manpower to eradicate all the threats they face, and that's why they come to us.

[Decision(options="If it's security they want, I'm not sure Rhodes Island's the right choice.",values="1")]

[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#1")]
[name="Dobermann"]These companies have long been on very good terms with us, and we've worked with them many times before.
[name="Dobermann"]In addition to providing periodic Oripathy medical treatment and disaster relief support, we should also assist them with their security issues to strengthen the trust between us.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#2")]
[name="Dobermann"]There are no downsides here. It's win-win.
[name="Dobermann"]A significant percentage of Rhodes Island's operating cash flow comes from our projects with these companies, and they have also been providing us all kinds of assistance and support for our work in the area.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#1")]
[name="Dobermann"]There's one more thing to consider.
[name="Dobermann"]To improve our Operators' combat abilities, we have to keep upgrading their modules and equipment, and that requires a huge amount of rare resources.
[name="Dobermann"]Quite a few of the companies are involved in those industries, like the Vincent Refinery.
[Character(name="avg_348_ceylon_1#3$1")]
[name="Ceylon"]Doctor, per our memorandum of understanding with them, they are willing to provide the resources we need for our modules as part of the remuneration for our Stationary Security Service.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1")]
[name="Amiya"]Doctor, it'll be much easier for Rhodes Island to operate across Terra with these companies speaking on our behalf and making the proper introductions.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]More importantly, Ceylon bought us an understanding with the companies: The Stationary Security Service will serve as the foundation of our collaboration. We will get to provide the local Infected the help they need.
[name="Amiya"]Even though it was only added to the memoranda of understanding as footnote, it's more than enough for us to work toward this partnership.

[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_373_lionhd#1")]
[name="Leonhardt"]Doctor, the Stationary Security Service is a little more complicated than our normal operations.
[name="Leonhardt"]Based on what Ceylon and I learned on this survey trip, these companies' work sites are all typically deep underground and have complicated terrain and varying levels of pollution.
[name="Leonhardt"]Because of these unique environments, your command and deployment will see severe limitations.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#1")]
[name="Dobermann"]Aside from the companies that Ceylon has signed on during this survey trip, we're also getting requests in a similar vein elsewhere. Not just from Rim Billiton and Victoria, and not just mining companies.
[name="Dobermann"]Of course, we'll scrutinize their credentials. Going forward, Stationary Security Service will become one of Rhodes Island's regular, routinely updated services.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]Having to travel to these complicated combat environments and adjust to this new mode of battle will prove to be a challenge for our Operators.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex#1")]
[name="Dobermann"]They need a calm, flexible commander who knows how to adapt to the situation, and you're quite the professional when it comes to that.
