Fifteen years have passed.
One by one, our numbers have dwindled as familiar faces left, with only a dozen young newcomers to replace them. To those on the outside, the Knights of the Tower have become a shell of their former self, a place to escape from conflict, or to earn empty prestige.
But I received a letter today from a young girl, only eleven years old. Her family name is Montague, a name that is not unknown to the pages of these annals. I thought she had come to seek temporary refuge, just like the other scions from noble families, but she looked me in the eye and said she sought a knight mentor to train her in the ways of the Knights.
I have decided to instruct Isabelle Montague personally.
