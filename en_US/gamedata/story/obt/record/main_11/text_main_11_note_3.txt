Lucia Skamandros was the daughter of the 4th White Wolf Count.
She served in the Londinium City Guard before joining the Knights of the Tower at the age of 22.
With the permission of the King of Aslan, she relinquished her title during the Kazdel campaign to join the expeditionary force. She fought bravely in battle, leading her troops to capture a fortress near Kazdel alongside the Steam Knights, killing a Vampire prince and multiple highly-ranked Nachzehrer officers.
She was given the highest military honors upon return to Victoria, inheriting her father's title five years later.
