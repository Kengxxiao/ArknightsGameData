My dear Isabelle, I expect I am no longer of this world by the time you read this.
I told you countless times in the last ten years that the Knights of the Tower believe that our king will return someday. What I did not tell you was that this was not a hope that I and the other older knights clung on, but a burden that forced us to trudge on even in the darkest hour.
Watching you as you grew over the years has filled me with an emotion that I can only describe as 'hope.' Forgive this joint decision by your teacher and your comrades.
Isabelle Montague. You may be the last Knight of the Tower, but your duty is more than just awaiting the return of a king.
Carry with you these annals, the honor of the Knights of the Tower, a snapshot of Londinium's history over the centuries. Carry them into Victoria's future.
