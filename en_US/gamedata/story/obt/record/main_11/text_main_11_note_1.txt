Lady Livia of House Gildas was a former attendant of Lady Patricia of House Artorius.
She was named a Knight of the Tower at the age of 14.
She was 26 years old when a sudden windstorm swept the royal capital. Though she suffered grievous injuries, she escorted the royal family to an underground shelter, where they remained unharmed despite the windstorm causing massive devastation in the nearby areas over a period of three days. Lady Livia herself, however, died of her injuries.
After the calamity passed, the royal palace was rebuilt on top of the shelter, and a watchtower was erected at the spot of Lady Livia's passing, in honor of her service.
