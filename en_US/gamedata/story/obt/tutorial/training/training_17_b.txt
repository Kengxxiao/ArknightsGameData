[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Incoming! That new enemy is a Guerrilla Herald, and he uses an encrypted language to relay messages to the other troops!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_beagle")] Woah! Wh-why does it feel like the enemies are coming at us way harder now?!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Hold on a bit longer, Beagle! ...I'll go take care of that new enemy!
[Tutorial(focusX=-310, focusY=190, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
While on the battlefield, Heralds will continuously issue tactical commands to their squad members, increasing the <@tu.kw>ATK</> and <@tu.kw>DEF</> of all enemies!
[Tutorial(focusX=10, focusY=10, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
After receiving these commands, some enemies will even use <@tu.kw>special abilities</>! Look, this Guerrilla Sniper is shooting <@tu.kw>two</> of our Operators at the same time.
[Tutorial(focusX=-310, focusY=190, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
However, remember that even if these Heralds are the heart of the enemy's guerrilla warfare tactics, they're also a weak point we can exploit. Their lightweight equipment that emphasizes mobility also make them the <@tu.kw>least protected</> of all the guerrilla forces!
