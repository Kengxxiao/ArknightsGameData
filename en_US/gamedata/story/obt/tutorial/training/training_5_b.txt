[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] I see. This enemy is wearing heavy armor and has high defense, so physical attacks can't deal much damage to him.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Are you telling me you weren't even aware of that?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] No! I... I just don't know the enemy's actual attributes. When I served at Blacksteel as a mercenary, I was conducting weapon tests most of the time...

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_jesica")] Okay, hmm... A common solution is to <@tu.kw>use Arts attacks</> to penetrate the enemy's armor.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Good, you are correct. Now, try it out.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_sys")] A Caster Operator, <@tu.kw>Durin</>, is ready. You may deploy her any time.
