[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Doctor, please watch out for the enemy's elite units.

The Heavy Defender has high attack and extremely high defense. We won't be able to hold our defense once it merges with other enemy troops.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Fortunately, there aren't many enemy elite units. We can significantly weaken them before they arrive at the main stage.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] The best way to deal with a large and slow enemy unit is to use a <@tu.kw>Slowing Supporter</> and a <@tu.kw>Single-target Caster</> Operator in tandem.
[Tutorial(focusX=-179, focusY=63, focusWidth=119, focusHeight=123, anchor="BottomRight", \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
As a Slowing Supporter, <@tu.kw>Orchid</> can greatly <@tu.kw>reduce enemy's move speed</>, thus slowing down its attack pace.
[Tutorial(focusX=-61, focusY=62, focusWidth=117, focusHeight=123, anchor="BottomRight", \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] \
While the enemy is controlled, Single-target Casters like <@tu.kw>Durin</> can deal <@tu.kw>lots of damage</> to it.
[Tutorial(focusX=1, focusY=-55, focusWidth=258, focusHeight=153, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \

Deploy them here to prevent the Heavy Defender from joining with other enemy units.
