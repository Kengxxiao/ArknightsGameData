[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_12fce")] This fighting force now helping Reunion has experienced countless wars of all shapes and sizes, and they use equipment and tactics that set them apart from any other Reunion troops.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_12fce")] We'll need to use some extraordinary measures to counter their heavily-armored units.
[Tutorial(focusX=200, focusY=200, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_sys", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] <@tu.kw>Interference Mines</> will explode upon contact, dealing a large amount of True damage and rendering the affected enemies more vulnerable to damage for a period of time.
[Tutorial(focusX=200, focusY=200, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_sys", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] However, <@tu.kw>Interference Mines</> also need time to execute a startup sequence after deployment, and cannot detonate until this program has loaded.
[Tutorial(focusX=-5, focusY=15, focusWidth=220, focusHeight=220,           animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", anchor="BottomRight",           protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_12fce", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] These devices take advantage of the Originium Arts of our Operators, and can damage an enemy's nervous system. Some of us call them <@tu.kw>Interference Mines</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_12fce")] Even so, someone has to step on them first before the Originium Arts inside can become effective. You'll be able to put them to good use, right?
