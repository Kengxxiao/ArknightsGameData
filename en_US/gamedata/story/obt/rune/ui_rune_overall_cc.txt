——Catastrophes.
——Nobody knows when they started occurring, but their ever-increasing frequency tore the land asunder.
People took refuge within the wisdom of their predecessors, constructing havens of concrete and steel known as 'nomadic cities' to escape annihilation.
However, Catastrophes continued to relentlessly hunt all life above surface, creating suffering that greatly eclipsed the impact of the actual Catastrophes.
Someone has to take on the task of stopping the spread of Catastrophes, and of bringing equilibrium to the various city-states that held only contempt and hatred for one another.

Otherwise, we will be powerless to defend ourselves, long before the Catastrophes tear us apart.

But mankind has never surrendered its lease on life readily.
While people across the world were searching for a way to survive, a special information exchange network - called the 'Contingency Contract' system - came into existence.
The Contingency Contract system operates independently from any known political entity, and was founded and operated by Catastrophe Messengers since its inception.
It receives special tasks posted by various individuals or organizations across the world, then forwards them to those who are able to complete the tasks.
Catastrophe Messengers collect intelligence and material resources from the participating parties, provide valuable support for those in dire need, and recompensate those who have lent their aid.
Rhodes Island undoubtedly is one of the most recognized organizations participating in the Contingency Contract system.
Due to the widespread rioting incited by the Reunion Movement, Rhodes Island was temporarily cut off from the Contingency Contract system.
But just as people are tenacious, the bridge between Rhodes Island and the Contingency Contract system is being restored once more.

————For anyone out there who wants to make a difference:
We don't care about who you are or where you're from, whether you're a force of good or evil - all that matters is what you're capable of. Survive, get the job done, and get paid.
Take on more dangerous challenges, and earn bigger bounties. That is, if you survive.
No matter what disasters await this world, the 'Contingency Contract' network will always continue to weave the web that never sees the light of day.
Everything for the benefit of more lives.
——'Contingency Contract'
