[name="Exusiai"]I guess you wouldn't know, but, in Laterano, we carry guns and live rounds to these events as a show of respect.

[name="Exusiai"]I'm not sure if she did that out of instinct or experience, but she fired her weapon to propel herself and land safely.
[name="Exusiai"]The thing is, there was a load-bearing column where she shot her grenade, so that blew open a corner of the assembly hall.
