[name="Weedy"]The Inquisition...
[Character(name="avg_400_weedy_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_529_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Luli"]They brought a research proposal on maritime engineering, a handwritten letter from an Inquisitor, and an entrance permit into Iberia issued by the Inquisition.

[name="Luli"]But Iberia is in my blood. No matter how far away I go, I'll always smell the scent of brine in the air, and follow it back to Iberia.
[name="Luli"]There were two reasons I came here. The first was to hand over the responsibilities of the Rhine Lab liaison. The second was to seek you out.

[name="Weedy"]For the reason you brought up before tossing it aside: I need to stay at Rhodes Island.
[name="Weedy"]Abuelo hated Iberia, and he hated the Inquisition, for laying waste to his life's work in an instant.
[name="Weedy"]But he wouldn't leave the country, even after his research license was revoked.
[name="Weedy"]I thought it was because he was old and didn't feel like going through the effort of starting over.
[name="Weedy"]But there's no such thing as a utopia for scientific freedom. Far too many scientists have died in exile.

[name="Closure"]You know how excited Blaze gets in battle. She didn't mean it.
[name="Closure"]And you know I get a little hare-brained when things get busy.
[name="Closure"]I didn't reject those funding applications you sent last week, I just misplaced them!
[name="Closure"]Heck, I still remember the titles! 'Connecting Heterogenous Arts Units,' 'Reengineering Ægir Maritime Technology Through Lighthouse Components'... they have a lot of potential.

[name="Closure"]Oh... Well, anyway, I want you to give serious consideration to staying at Rhodes Island.
