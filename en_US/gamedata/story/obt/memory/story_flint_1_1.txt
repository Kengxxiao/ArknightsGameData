[Character(name="avg_npc_163")]
[name="Calm Woman"]What happened to your face?
[Character(name="avg_npc_164")]
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]Eh, don't get me started. I ran into a bunch of barbarians who've got nothing but muscles growing in their brains. They said I had to fight their warriors to go inside the village, then they immediately welcomed me with a punch in the face.
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]The village was small and rundown. They hardly have any people there, and they haven't even seen transport repair tools before. What a waste of time!
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]Did you find anything on your end?
[Character(name="avg_npc_163")]
[name="Calm Woman"]Nothing. I took a stroll in the other direction and found a redhead Vulpo fixing his transport. He said he was going to take me on a ride once it was fixed.
[name="Calm Woman"]I followed him around a little, and there were only some rundown houses.
[name="Calm Woman"]Though it kind of felt like he didn't want me poking around too much. Something didn't feel right about that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_164")]
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]If you ask me, I think there's nothing to the rumors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_163")]
[name="Calm Woman"]You sure? You remember what the Padishah ordered us to do, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_164")]
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]Of course, but the results couldn't be more clear.
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]At the very least, we've found no developing power here, and there's nothing we can gain from this place either. The Messenger stationed here wasn't lying.
[Character(name="avg_npc_163")]
[name="Calm Woman"]But according to the gossip...
[name="Calm Woman"]I just think something doesn't add up about all this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_164")]
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]You said it yourself. It's just gossip.
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]The Messenger here... Our intel calls her Inam. She liked to trade and barter to begin with, so I'm not surprised the rumors got blown out of proportion.
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]Besides...
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]If the lords ameer take control of the territory here and it doesn't meet their expectations, having painted a rosy picture is only going to get us in trouble.
[Character(name="avg_npc_163")]
[name="Calm Woman"]...Fair enough.
[name="Calm Woman"]You're right. They're a bunch of barbarians who do nothing but compare who's got the bigger fists. How could they possibly have fooled the two of us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_164")]
[name="Swept-Up Trader?"]Let's go back to the city and let the Padishah know.

[name="Broca"]We hid all the machines and metal choppers in a cave nearby. Nobody saw us.

[Character(name="char_356_broca",name2="char_415_flint_1",focus=2)]
[name="Flint"]We didn't have a choice, since there was more than one of them. I asked Chiave to take care of the other person.

[name="Flint"]Haha, just kidding.
[name="Flint"]But now those guys definitely consider us a bunch of barbarians who only think about fighting.
[name="Flint"]I took that guy to an old, abandoned settlement that's only used as a rest stop by warriors traveling outside the tribe, and he suspected nothing.
[Character(name="char_356_broca",name2="char_415_flint_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Broca"]You can't say that for sure.
[Character(name="char_356_broca",name2="char_415_flint_1",focus=2)]
[name="Flint"]It's fine as long as he can't be sure of anything either.
[name="Flint"]As long as they don't get to the bottom of it, they won't report anything to their higher ups.
[name="Flint"]—That's what the Doctor said.
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3",name2="char_415_flint_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4")]
[name="Chiave"]Hahahahahahaha!
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1")]
[name="Flint"]Ahem. Okay, back on topic.
[name="Flint"]Now that they're gone, we should be able to keep the status quo for a while longer. Inam, Zumama, and Gavial are all away. We'll have to settle for this.
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3")]
[name="Broca"]Those guys won't give up that easily.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]I guess that's true. If this was going to be that simple, Inam wouldn't have asked me to hold the fort.
[name="Flint"]Yeah... I'll have my tribesmen keep an eye out around the rainforest. If any of them come back, we'll deal with it somehow.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]Whoa.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#2")]
[name="Flint"]...What?
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4")]
[name="Chiave"]Man, I didn't expect the boss, that Inam, to trust you so much!
[name="Chiave"]I only ever see you follow Blaze around. You don't even talk to the other operators from here all that much. I really didn't think you'd come all the way back like they did the moment you got that letter.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]It's true. I don't keep in contact with my tribe much.
[name="Flint"]Thankfully, I was in Columbia not too long ago. Inam gave me a call and asked me to bring a bunch of discarded metal choppers.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1")]
[name="Flint"]I'm not really too sure why she trusted me with this...
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3")]
[name="Broca"]You brought all those here?
[name="Broca"]You have an eye for them. They can be put to good use once they're fixed up.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]Why wouldn't she trust you? She saw how much you've grown. It's a good thing!
[name="Chiave"]I followed you guys here thinking I could help come up with ideas when push came to shove, but looks like you didn't need me at all.
[name="Chiave"]You're always fighting Broca, so I thought you were the kind of girl who rushes right up to your opponents to beat them up.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]I did kind of do that, too.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#2")]
[name="Chiave"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1")]
[name="Flint"]Never mind.
[name="Flint"]Acahualla's changed a lot, and the tribe has all these funny looking... machines. I really have no idea how they learned to put them together.
[name="Flint"]I thought Zumama's stuff was weird enough, but at least those things were shaped normal.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]The ones they made are pretty interesting, if you ask me.
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3")]
[name="Broca"]As long as it's practical.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]That's true. At the very least, life's gotten much better with these machines.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]Really? If you guys came up with a machine that planted crops and hunted on its own, your Tiacauh warrior fists wouldn't mean anything for much longer.
[name="Chiave"]You seriously don't care even a little?
[Character(name="char_356_broca")]
[name="Broca"]Hey, Chiave!
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4")]
[name="Chiave"]Eh, I'm just curious!
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1")]
[name="Flint"]......
[name="Flint"]I lost the right to determine my tribe's direction the moment I left my tribesmen behind.
[name="Flint"]If the Tiacauhs chose this, then there's no problem. I don't understand what these machines are all about, but I trust the people here.
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3")]
[name="Broca"]Yeah.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]Fair enough.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]Besides, I've thought about things while I was on Rhodes Island.
[name="Flint"]...If everything could be solved by beating up your enemies, I wouldn't have so much to worry about.
[name="Flint"]There was this time when... uh... I accompanied the Doctor as a bodyguard to a business meeting with a company, and they really tried to boss us around right from the start.
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3")]
[name="Broca"]It happens.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1")]
[name="Flint"]I couldn't help myself, so I beat them all up.
[Character(name="char_356_broca")]
[name="Broca"]...It happens.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]Ahh... Yeah, that can be a pain in the ass to deal with.
[name="Chiave"]How come the Doctor didn't stop you?
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]Of course they did, so I beat them up while the Doctor was asleep.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#4")]
[name="Chiave"]Hey, hold on. I think I heard about this.
[name="Chiave"]So you were the one who wanted to give the Doctor more rest and stood guard outside the door, and ended up beating up all the guys who came looking for trouble?
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#2")]
[name="Flint"]Don't remind me...
[name="Flint"]The deal almost fell through because of that, but we managed to save it at the expense of the Doctor's sanity.
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1")]
[name="Flint"]...Anyway, I gave everyone lots of trouble that time.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave")]
[name="Chiave"]Good thing the Doctor was there. They didn't give you a hard time, right?
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]Not at all. Actually, after we got back to Rhodes Island, they told me that fists really do mean everything.
[Character(name="char_349_chiave#2")]
[name="Chiave"]Huh?
[Character(name="char_415_flint_1#5")]
[name="Flint"]But our fists have to be big enough for that to work... and we don't always have what it takes yet, so we have to come up with other ways to solve our problems.
[Character(name="char_356_broca#3")]
[name="Broca"]Fair point.
