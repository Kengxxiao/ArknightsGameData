[name="Eyjafjalla"]  Ahem, well then... Today is the third day of the field expedition, and we've almost made it to the survey site.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  The time now is ten thirty... is that a one? Sorry, I can't see very clearly, but it's morning.

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  I-It's fine... Barty, I can walk on my own. The visibility here is very good, so you don't need to worry about me running into things.
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Barty"]  You sure? The wind's pretty strong out here though, and there are rocks jutting out all over the place. Wouldn't it be better for you to stay on the aircraft?
[name="Barty"]  Besides, when I left, I told Dr. Kal'tsit I would keep you safe. Bet my whole next month's salary on it.

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  I'm very sorry. You were just talking about your work, right?
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  I know how reliable you are, Barty. You've been a great help to me on this trip. If I was alone here, even setting up this equipment would've taken all afternoon.
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  I've done it before. Back when I was in school, there were some research projects I had to carry out by myself.

[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Barty"]  Right, I almost forgot through all that small talk, you're a real accomplished scholar. I guess the other students couldn't keep up with you?
[name="Operator Barty"]  But even so, they were working you way too hard back in school.
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  It actually wasn't that bad... S-Seriously, don't worry about it. I can handle myself, I just take my time.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  But you know, after coming to Rhodes Island, it is much more convenient to get things done, whether on the landship or out in the field.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  My new hearing aids are a lot better than the ones I was using before. Dr. Kal'tsit and the Professor are both supportive of my research, and Closure even helped me renovate my room...
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  The other operators always take very good care of me, just like you are now. I'm so glad I have all of you.
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  Yes, I know. What you said is true. But, the source of the anomalous Originium readings is right up ahead. We need more precise detection method, and that requires my Arts.
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Barty"]  Why not use the data from the sampling sites? There's a lot to pick from, right?
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  No good. We can't overlook even the smallest detail if we want accurate results. If I get lazy here, our entire mission may fall short.
[Character(name="char_180_amgoat",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Operator Barty"]  I know that serious look, you've made up your mind... then we've got no choice. Let's go.
[name="Operator Barty"]  But let me get this out of the way, Eyjafjalla, if you ever feel uncomfortable, we're going to stop to take a break. You've got a duty to your research, but I've got a duty to protect you.

[name="Operator Barty"]  I guess not... Ahaha... You really are a true scholar, aren't you?
[name="Operator Barty"]  You can look past the superficial noise and cut straight to the truth at just a glance.

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  The time is now 3:14 P.M. Data collection and analysis are progressing steadily.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  A small incident occurred just now on the way to the last sampling site. Of course, it hasn't affected our work.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  I also had some interesting conversations with Mr. Guide and Operator Barty along the way...
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  Even though I'm not sure I understood everything they meant, I think Barty said I'm a true scholar...
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  I blushed a little when I heard that... and it also made me think of something that happened before I left.

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  B-But... the anomalous Originium signal is likely related to volcanic activity, and it happens to be situated on Rhodes Island's next route.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  Both as a volcanologist and as an Operator of Rhodes Island, I must complete this field survey.

[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#9",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]  I also consider myself an academic of sorts, so I can kind of understand how she feels.
[name="Ceylon"]  In other words, if I was given an opportunity to learn more about Originium, I'd definitely do everything within my power to make that happen.
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#9",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]  I know, but... I'm just worried that another mission would worsen her condition further.
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  While I still can... while my legs can still support me... While my eyes... can still see that light... the brightness of the volcanoes.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_180_amgoat",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]  Yes, those lights... A an armchair scientist like me might not be able to see them, but I know Eyjafjalla can.
[name="Ceylon"]  Scholars like her have always been on the bleeding edge, pushing this world's knowledge forward. Every time she can move forward is another step that we'll be able to follow.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_180_amgoat",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]  Moving forward may not always be a good thing. It might be scary, and it might trip you up. But I'm not going to stop Eyjafjalla's progress just because I'm worried she'll get hurt.
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Medic Operator"]  I see...

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  Right... Thank you. Thank you so much, and you as well, Miss Ceylon.

[name="Eyjafjalla"]  That was the same topic back there.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  What does it mean to be a scholar, a scientist? I don't think I've ever given this much thought.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  Ceylon was right. I wanted to delve deeper into these volcanoes, to explore the mystery of the deepest parts of this land while I still have the time.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  When I was young, if I had to think of what was a true scholar, I would have thought of my mom and dad...
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  But now, there's one more person.
[name="Eyjafjalla"]  So, can you tell me the answer to this question when I get back—— Professor?
