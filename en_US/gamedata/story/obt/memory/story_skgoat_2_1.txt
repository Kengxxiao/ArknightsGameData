[name="Earthspirit"]It's a design for an Arts Unit inhibitor, but still very much in the theoretical stage.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]She taught me how to hear the vibrations of certain minerals using Originium Arts, but all that turned to pure noise after I became Infected.
[name="Earthspirit"]At least treatment at Rhodes Island put an end to that. Now I can hear them again, even clearer than before.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]At the time, though, we were at our wits' end. She believed the Oripathy increased my Arts output, so she said she'd make me an inhibitor after I'd worked for a full year.
[Character(name="avg_npc_499_1#1$1")]
[name="Miss Bachmann"]An Arts Unit?
[name="Miss Bachmann"]How hard can it be to order a custom-made Arts Unit in Leithanien? Why did Mom have to do it herself?
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#12$1")]
[name="Earthspirit"]Simply suppressing my Arts would have prevented me from hearing the sounds at all.
[name="Earthspirit"]So it could only be made by someone familiar with both the Arts involved and the vibration frequencies of minerals, who could manually calibrate the inhibition of different wavelengths—like tuning an instrument.
[Character(name="avg_npc_499_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1")]

[name="Miss Bachmann"]Sorry, I'll need more of an explanation than that.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#1$1")]
[name="Earthspirit"]Some rocks undergo metamorphism when they come into contact with Originium, resulting in metamorphic rock that contains Originium.
[name="Earthspirit"]Such rocks react to my Originium Arts, allowing me to sense them with the help of a tuning fork.
[name="Earthspirit"]The professor would use the rocks with the strongest reactions as beacon stones.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1")]

[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]Not many people do this in the first place, and it's even less likely that their stones would use the same frequency. If anything, it would help us identify who else had passed through.
[Character(name="avg_npc_499_1#1$1")]
[name="Miss Bachmann"]Sounds like a convenient Art.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#12$1")]
[name="Earthspirit"]It's just about causing small vibrations in matter. Frequency control is a relatively minor part, the key is understanding the mineral composition.
[Character(name="avg_npc_499_1#1$1")]
[name="Miss Bachmann"]So why did she leave this to you?
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#8$1")]
[name="Earthspirit"]Perhaps it's a clue, a way of asking me to use my Arts to search the city for this beacon's frequency.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#1$1")]

[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[name="Provence"]Don't eat so much fried food. Here, have some veggies.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]But a little bit now and then improves my mood. Want some fries?
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#11$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]I guess that means your mood needs improving?
[name="Provence"]Don't push yourself too hard, okay? But no, I don't even know how you can stomach those cold, soggy things.

[name="Provence"]So, what was in the box?
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#8$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]Geological units collected from north of Ursus.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#8$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Sounds like things are about to get busy for you.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#1$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]Not really. The professor said these came from unexplored lands. We may not get a chance to visit there in our lifetimes.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#2$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]She always said she'd leave them to me someday, but I didn't expect her to already have made the preparations.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#2$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]Isn't it hard for researchers like you to keep your curiosity in check?
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#12$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]I still have a lot of hobbies. I get to do what I like after work, rather than worrying about what needs my attention.
[name="Earthspirit"]Besides, I made a promise to the professor.
[name="Earthspirit"]My job is just to keep these safe, and report to Kal'tsit and the Doctor. Nothing more, nothing less.

[name="Earthspirit"]...I just remembered that I still haven't made my report.
[Character(name="avg_183_skgoat_1#7$1",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Earthspirit"]Ugh... looks like another rough afternoon.
