[character(name="char_187_ccheal_1#2")]

[name="Myrrh"]Seems a little dodgy...
[character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]

[character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#6$1")]
[name="Myrrh"]There are many superstitious people where I'm from, and I've picked up a few tricks to deal with them.

[name="Old Woman"]There you are, Adelaide. Good to see you one last time before I leave.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=1)]
[name="Myrrh"]Your symptoms are under control, and should remain stable for the foreseeable future. As long as you watch your diet and take the suppressant regularly. 
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]Thank you so much for doing all this for an old sack of bones like me.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=1)]
[name="Myrrh"]I'm just doing my job. Oh, before I forget... here, I got you a sour apple pie to eat on the way.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]Aw, aren't you just a sweetheart? You remember my favorite.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=1)]
[name="Myrrh"]I'll see you off then.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#2$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]Sure thing, love.
[name="Old Woman"]Before I came here, I was all outta hope. I would just sit on my bed all day, wishing to kick the bucket already.
[name="Old Woman"]Until I met you.
[name="Old Woman"]Now I can feel Mika by my side all the time. I see her whenever I look at the mountains, the trees, the flowers, the grass, the rain, the snow...
[name="Old Woman"]I want to see more, to keep seeing her.
[name="Old Woman"]And to do that, I've gotta keep on living.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=1)]
[name="Myrrh"]I'm sure she'd be happy. Take care, Mrs. Luba. I'm not sure how often we can see each other again...

[name="Old Woman"]Come now, pull yourself together.

Myrrh smiles and takes the old woman's hand. The two of them walk quietly over the snow.

Only when they have arrived at the village gate does the old woman hesitantly begin to speak.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#6$1", name2="avg_npc_093#5",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]Adelaide... let me ask you something. Answer me honestly.
[name="Old Woman"]All that stuff you told me... is it really true?
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_093#5",focus=1)]
[name="Myrrh"]Mrs. Luba...
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_093",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]I mean, do you believe it? Be honest.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#9$1")]
[name="Myrrh"]I don't know.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#1$1")]
[name="Myrrh"]When I was little, the chief would brew me medicine whenever I was sick. And I always got better soon after taking it.
[name="Myrrh"]I used to think it was so amazing.
[name="Myrrh"]But when I came to the landship, I began to study its composition, to learn medicine in a systematic matter.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#3$1")]
[name="Myrrh"]That's when I found that it was just a common herbal drink, with no special effects.
[name="Myrrh"]So I put away my research on it, and turned to studying other medicines.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrrh"]But I still find myself making it whenever I get sick, simply out of habit.
[name="Myrrh"]And not just when I'm sick - I do it when an experiment didn't go well, or when I can't sleep, or when I scrape my knee after a fall.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_093#5",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]Why do you keep drinking it, even though you know it has no effect?
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_093#5",focus=1)]
[name="Myrrh"]I'm not sure why... sorry.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_093#5",focus=2)]
[name="Old Woman"]Why... why, indeed?

[name="Myrrh"]Is it all true, Harmonia? Does this dance really bring the dead back to our side? Does the Great Green really exist?

[name="Harmonia"]Adelaide... I can't answer that question, because I don't know either.
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#4$1")]
[name="Myrrh"]Why do you join the chief in the guiding dance then, if you don't know sure?
[Character(name="avg_117_myrrh_1#4$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Harmonia"]Because I hope that it's true, and that someday we'll reunite with the ones who have left us.
[name="Harmonia"]That's why I dance.
[name="Harmonia"]This land has too many troubles and hardships. The helpless must learn to help themselves, and the lost must learn to find their own answers.
[name="Harmonia"]That's why we place our hopes on the ethereal, on the supernatural.
[name="Harmonia"]That's why we have superstitions.
