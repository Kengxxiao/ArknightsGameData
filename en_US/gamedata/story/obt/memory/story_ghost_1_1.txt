[name="Suzuran"]But you're always on such difficult, dangerous missions...
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]Though it's a reluctant thing, to Rhodes Island, people like me who can 'cut through to the chase' are indispensable.
[name="Meteorite"]It's easier on myself, as well. After all, going on safe, secure work would've actually dulled me.
[name="Meteorite"]That said, as a 'chase-cutter,' Specter is certainly much sharper than I am.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Do you know... what kind of person Specter is?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]We only worked together once.
[name="Meteorite"]She's a young woman from the deep sea. A presence whose mind is a bit of a challenge to comprehend for the rest of us.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Huh...?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]Unable to carry out tactical communication. She takes up her weapon, hears an order, and then heed only that sole commander's orders until the mission is over and done with.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Is Specter... a very quiet person?
[character(name="char_219_meteo_1#1")]
[name="Meteorite"]If you call not uttering a single word 'quiet.'
[name="Meteorite"]But silence is far from just an affectation, it is also a choice.
[name="Meteorite"]When she sees terrifying, murderous enemies before us, and monsters who roar as they charge us, she preserves that 'quiet' way of hers unbroken, with her mood completely unreadable.
[name="Meteorite"]After that... she wreaks her most unwavering destruction, as if from start to end she believes that she, on her own, is facing off against every single threat.
[name="Meteorite"]I imagine that, aside from listening to her commander's orders, she gives not one care for her own body.
[name="Meteorite"]Whether enemy or ally, alive or dead, she sees none of the emotional fluctuation between anything or anyone in her surroundings.
[name="Meteorite"]Yet, I wonder if her wordless self is ultimately aware of how she 'holds her peace,' and whether she hopes to communicate with others.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Th... Then, setting battle aside, would Specter have any relation to anyone else?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]Now that's a difficult question... but, and I imagine, Specter's psychological state is far from suited to a normal life.
[name="Meteorite"]At the very least... I can't picture her dwelling ordinarily in the dormitories.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Then that means... maybe the Medical team has more...?

[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#5",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Hehe, thank you, Meteorite. If we get another chance, I'd like to hear you share more of your war stories.
[name="Suzuran"]If conflict is unavoidable, if our only option to protect them is to fight... I hope I can protect the friends and family I hold dear too.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_219_meteo_1#1",focus=2)]

[name="Suzuran"]No! Nothing that scary, Folinic.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]Just messing with you. I'm on break right now; if you want to play something with me, I'm all ears.
[name="Folinic"]So. What's on your mind?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Actually, I'm preparing a Christmas present for a gift exchange.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]Mmhm, mmhm.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]And also, my partner for the exchange is Specter.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]Mmhm... mm? Did you say Specter?
[name="Folinic"]Wait, she shouldn't have left the med bay recently. How could she...
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Ah... so you do know something about Specter.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#5",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]That's brilliant. I was afraid I figured it wrong.
[name="Suzuran"]I-I'm giving Specter a handmade memento doll, so I want to know some things about her.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]Info about Specter... huh.
[name="Folinic"]I can confirm I've assisted Dr. Kal'tsit in treating her before.
[name="Folinic"]But her mental state has been overly unstable as of recent. A while's already passed without her leaving her treatment room.
[name="Folinic"]Did she really sign up to a gift exchange?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]I-I think anyone has the right to enter it.
[name="Suzuran"]But Meteorite said that Specter wouldn't take part in a game like this, too. Maybe... maybe somebody helped her sign up?
[name="Suzuran"]But no matter what, I'm not going to mess this up!
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]That's for sure. You're a goody-two-shoes, Suzuran.
[name="Folinic"]By my guess, there's only the ones who visit her that... ahem, no, forget it, nothing.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Is Specter very ill, and unable to leave?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]During her very few moments of lucidity, Specter might choose to head outside for a bit.
[name="Folinic"]But her language systems have been greatly affected, and rather than saying anything someone might misconstrue, she chooses to be silent most of the time.
[name="Folinic"]Hm... on the battlefield, she displays calm behavior exhibited through past muscle memory, and after her fill of combat, her period of over-fatigue allows her to soundly rest.
[name="Folinic"]So don't worry too much. Specter leads her lifestyle in the manners she's able to choose.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]If that's true, I want to see her...!
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]That's...
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]So I can't, after all...
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]Even I can't enter from her room at will, most of the time.
[name="Folinic"]I understand you want to give your gift to her in person, but given Specter's current condition, that may be extremely difficult.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Hm.
[name="Suzuran"]But I just hope... even if I can't meet her, I can at least finish this present, and have it reach her hands.
[name="Suzuran"]I think there's a lot of meaning in giving and receiving gifts!
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]That's really, really great. Good on you, Suzuran. Make sure you hold onto that kind heart!
[name="Folinic"](Whisper) Actually, as long as the info's not too sensitive, it's not like I can't make an exception for you.
[name="Folinic"]Hehe. Who made me Kal'tsit's trusted disciple?
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]Thank you, Folinic...! If it's okay, I want to gather any design elements I can use to make the souvenir Specter doll...

[name="Folinic"]Damn, it's her. Here we go...
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]Just overheard while I was passing by the door, that is all. You want to make a doll of Specter, do you?
[name="Warfarin"]Now isn't that such a cute notion! I'll help!
[character(name="char_345_folnic_1")]
[name="Folinic"]Even that couldn't escape your eavesdropping, Dr. Warfarin.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]Honestly, I could give you her measurements: bust, waist, AND hips. Plus the precise material used in her clothes... my access far outstrips Dr. Folinic's here.
[character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]Y-You really know all those details...?
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]More than that, I could also help get your doll into Specter's hands.
[name="Warfarin"]Of course, my price... heh, heh, you peddling Penguin Logistician, I'll have that commemorative run of tomato juice out of your mitts yet...

[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]Wasn't that a very dangerous spot you were just in? I don't think allowing Suzuran to know the present truth of things vis-a-vis Specter is any good idea.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]She cares, that's all. She's a smart girl, and knows there are many things she shouldn't come to understand, nor need to be aware of.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]Just a little curiosity can put one in an irreversibly sticky situation. It's a very well-worn warning.
[name="Warfarin"]Even so, I wonder what warm heart thought to offer Specter a little extra kindness—
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]I imagine they set Suzuran up to give the gift as well.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]Quite. After all, anyone else raising Specter topics with no warning would raise some very clear-cut red flags.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]And only Suzuran could make us, or anyone, believe this was genuine passion and concern.
[name="Folinic"]Specter wouldn't be familiar with this, the holiday gift exchange... and has no way of preparing in time.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]Do you feel sorry for Suzuran?
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]I'm just...
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]To be clear, I didn't say what I just said for the fun of it.
[name="Warfarin"]Come the time, I'll have Suzuran give the sewn-up present over to me, and I'll think of some way to have Specter receive it.
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]But if we allow Dr. Kal'tsit to find out about this—
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]Didn't you just say? For Suzuran's sake, you wouldn't balk at using a little 'tiny bit of prerogative.'
[name="Warfarin"]To be factual, it's for Specter's sake as well.
[name="Warfarin"]How will she respond when she receives this gift...? That should have some experimental value, no?
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]But still... I have this feeling, the one apologizing to Dr. Kal'tsit in the end's going to be me!
[character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_345_folnic_1",focus=1)]

[name="Suzuran"]Hehe. I've already given Dr. Warfarin the doll I asked him to make so she could pass it on to Specter for Christmas.
[name="Suzuran"]Dr. Warfarin said Specter probably doesn't know who signed her up to the gift exchange, but when she got her present, her state seemed to improve a bit.
