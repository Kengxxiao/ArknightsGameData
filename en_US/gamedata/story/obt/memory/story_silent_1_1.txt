[name="Researcher A"]No need to thank us. We want to hang out with you too. We can talk about anything!

[name="Researcher B"]Of course. This is Trimounts, after all!
[name="Researcher B"]Who cares if you're a bit quiet in the bars, as long as you shine brightly in the labs!
[name="Researcher B"]As for this guy here, I'll throttle him if he asks any awkward questions.

[name="Silence"]The next time we go out together, I'm insisting that we go see the fountain in Trimounts Common.

[name="Joyce"]Do you like the fountain in Trimounts Common?
[character(name="avg_108_silent_1#2$1",name2="avg_128_plosis_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Yes, it reminds me of a little park back home. There was an identical fountain there, just a little smaller.
[character(name="avg_108_silent_1#2$1",name2="avg_128_plosis_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Joyce"]The fountain of Trimounts Common is known for its exotic design. It is possible that both fountains were built by Trimounts' Munson Inc.
[character(name="avg_108_silent_1#9$1",name2="avg_128_plosis_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Ha. I thought it was a fun coincidence, but I guess it's just Munson Inc. expanding its business into rural areas.

[name="Silence"]Let me think...
[name="Silence"]It's hard to know what to say, when you ask like that.

[name="Silence"]As far as I can tell, you're fully recovered, but Dr. Parvis recommended another week of rest for you, just in case.
