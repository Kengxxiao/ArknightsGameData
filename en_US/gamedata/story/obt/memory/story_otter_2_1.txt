Mayer was not slow on the uptake, but she could have been faster if she had shaken the habit of working with her headphones on.
The Meeboo SUPER activates its detonation sequence.
Using an extendable robotic arm, Mayer manages to press the shock shield activation button just in time, deflecting the Meeboo SUPER's directional explosion.
Lutra Workshop's key areas were undamaged, but the extendable platform near the door holding heavy materials is destroyed.
Mayer watches as the Meeboo SUPER is buried in the rubble it created.

I was so excited to get into Rhine Lab.
For researchers, it was the holy land for all of Columbia—all of Terra, even. It had the facilities, the projects, the talent, the pay, and the benefits.
We had a consensus that science would determine the future of Terra. Within Rhine Lab itself, however, everyone had their own interpretation of science, their own obsessions. Especially the directors.
It was an uncomfortable place. Some of the finest minds in the world, but woefully inefficient when they get together, like an all-star sports team that just can't seem to win.
I was in Engineering, providing technical support for the other sections. A project started by Energy last month, which was already halfway through preparations, was facing termination because of opposition from Control.
Similarly, the Defense Section could also put a stop to ongoing projects at their discretion.
This happened again and again at Rhine Lab. Low-level staff were in a constant cycle of installation, testing, and removal.
I felt like I was better off doing research on my own.
That's why I made a trick alarm clock that caused just a teensy bit of havoc in my workshop at preset times. Not enough to put the place out of commission, but serious enough that I'd have to rush back to deal with it.
[character(name="avg_242_otter_1#1$1")]
[name="Mayer"]That was the first Meeboo prototype.
[name="Mayer"]I gradually added more functions, and named them after the boot-up sound.
