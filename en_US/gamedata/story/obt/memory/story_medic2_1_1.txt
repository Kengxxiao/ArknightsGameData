[name="Lancet-2"]  Good evening, Doctor.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Of course, by the strictest definition, it's not evening anymore.
[name="Lancet-2"]  You appear exhausted. My sensors indicate that you have not entered a state of deep sleep for at least twenty hours—and occasionally dozing off certainly cannot be counted.
[Decision(options="No way about it. Too many files.;...Tired.;Who made me the Doctor of Rhodes Island, huh?!", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Your work is exceptionally important, Doctor, but it's as they say. Proper rest guarantees sustainable work.
[name="Lancet-2"]  All members of the Medical Department see the same way on this. That is why they frequently send me to accompany you, Doctor.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Um... although, aside from daily monitoring of your physiological state, there's not much more I can do.
[Decision(options="I'm in pretty good health.;......;...Sorry for the hassle.", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Doctor, I noticed... the mug by your right hand.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Your attempts to hide it behind the files are meaningless. Ms. Closure did not add an olfactory module to me, but my image analysis very rarely makes mistakes.
[name="Lancet-2"]  It's still piping hot... Doctor, you poured yourself that mug in secret just now.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Fifteen minutes ago, you were already on your fourth mug, weren't you?
[name="Lancet-2"]  Occasional intake of stimulants to the central nervous system can be beneficial, but considering that it is almost morning, I suggest you... drink coffee.
[Decision(options="Hm?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  My sensors indicated just now that your heartrate is rather higher than average, as are your adrenaline levels.
[PlaySound(key="$transmission", volume=0.6)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Therefore... drink more coffee.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Um? What happened to me just now... Is this a slip of the tongue everyone normally makes? So robots can also have tongue slips...
[PlaySound(key="$transmission", volume=0.6)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  In short, Doctor, please pay more mind to your rest, or else a Medical Department operator will lecture you again. As for your coffee... drink it.
[name="Lancet-2"]  ......

[Decision(options="Alright. I was planning to do just that.;......;Sounds like your logic's gone kinda wrong?", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Just where is this issue occurring...? My intent was to dissuade you, Doctor...
[name="Lancet-2"]  Is it my logic module? Or language...
[name="Lancet-2"]  Ohh... I've gone pathological... I can't even get something as minor as this right...

[name="Engineering Operator"]  And here I was moping about my third morning shift this week... seeing you so active, I feel a little more awake.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Anything I can help with?

[name="Lancet-2"]  Ohh... my language module's broken.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Jeez, is that right? Well, you don't see that every day.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Don't you get system checkups every week with Engineering? Last one was yesterday, wasn't it? Or was it the day before?
[name="Engineering Operator"]  You were all fine then. Closure made sure of it herself. She's the boss.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  What would cause a random malfunction?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  I do not know either... I have heard the model of robot I am typically has a ten year service lifespan. 
[name="Lancet-2"]  Currently, I'm only two years, three months and five days.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Uh... no need to be so nervous?
[name="Engineering Operator"]  To tell the truth, even when we're all retired early from overwork, you should still be as youthful as ever.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]

[name="Engineering Operator"]  I'm nowhere near my boss's level, for sure...
[name="Engineering Operator"]  But this one's a little too simple, isn't it?! It's just an ad-hoc silencer module. And someone did a real sloppy job of sticking it on your back. The angle's crooked, even.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  A silencer module? I have never heard of such a module.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Oh, only the old operators at Engineering would know about this. Way back when Closure was overhauling your operation platforms, your, uh, language libraries had some issues.
[Decision(options="What issues?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Ahem. Somebody carelessly input a collection of top swears from all over Terra into Castle-3.
[Decision(options="It's kind of hard to picture that.;......;You sure that was carelessness?", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  They were a little too comprehensive. We reassembled the expletive content in the processing module, and a complete deletion requires some time.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  So in the interim, we came up with these little modules. Using 'em's a cinch. Just turn it on like this, get up close, get the current flowing—
[name="Engineering Operator"]  And any words you don't want people hearing get jammed into inaudible frequencies.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  That way, effectiveness of expression might've suffered for the time being, but at least we could avoid Castle-3 generating unnecessary complaints from certain other departments.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Put it this way: ever since then, Rhodes Island has had a lot of little kiddos aboard, haha.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Ah... Though, well... why did this module end up on me?
[name="Lancet-2"]  I am able to guarantee that there are no words which should not exist within my language library. I ran a self-test on myself just thirty seconds ago.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Because your silencer isn't targeting any kind of swears.
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Hm... seems someone entered the phrase 'do not' to the list. That checks out with what you just described, Doctor, right?
[Decision(options="Lancet-2 definitely wanted to tell me 'do not drink coffee.'", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Yeah, hold up, I just noticed something on the back of the module... a piece of chewing gum?
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Someone sneaked a module out of our place, set up new target vocab, then used gum to stick it to Lancet-2?
[name="Engineering Operator"]  Real smart. Real easy mod, and one that'd sure as hell kick in. Question is, who'd do this?

[name="Lancet-2"]  Greetings, Operator Aciddrop.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Though what I detected earlier didn't seem to be... oh, never mind. It doesn't matter.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh, right, your checkup today is still pending. Please wait a moment. Once I have reconfirmed the Doctor's data, I will perform your scan for you.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Additionally, please do not utilize your skateboard within living areas. It's still early, and you will be liable to disturb other operators.
[name="Lancet-2"]  On the off-chance that a collision occurs, you may bring about further unnecessary bodily harm.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]

[name="Aciddrop"]  ......
[name="Aciddrop"]  Yeah, I guess it was.
[name="Aciddrop"]  I did the deed.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Judging from your configuration of the silencer's targeting, do you not wish for me to direct the words 'do not' at you?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  How do I lay it out...?
[name="Aciddrop"]  I'm used to living free, see, nobody on my back. So types like you... uh, kinda jam me up a little.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh, am I being bothersome? I'm sorry, it's never my intent to rouse such negative emotions.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Operator Aciddrop, ever since your arrival at Rhodes Island, your condition has been gradually stabilizing.
[name="Lancet-2"]  I'll report to Dr. Kal'tsit that we can reduce your checkup frequency.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  ...Not really what I meant.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Alright, I understand.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Operator Aciddrop, it's not checkups that you feel are bothersome, but rather myself, correct?
[name="Lancet-2"]  This isn't a difficult problem to address.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Medical Department staff may all be very busy, but they care very much about the health and vitality of our operators, especially those of younger age who have just recently arrived. I can simply request them to assign someone else to your checkups.
[Decision(options="You sound a little hurt, Lancet-2.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Not at all, Doctor. Please do not mislead our new operators. I'm only a robot, after all, and would never feel any sort of grievance.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Ohh, now that I look at it, I really do tend to tell people not to do things...

[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]

[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  I don't wanna get someone different.
[name="Aciddrop"]  You're good. What's wrong with robots? Robots are rad as hell, right.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  ...Thank you.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  Uh, it's like, how do I put it...?
[name="Aciddrop"]  It's not like I'm saying you're annoying, even though having someone constantly up in your grill is, uh, kinda annoying, but that's 'cause you, like, care about me, right? I do get that, yeah.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  In that case, Operator Aciddrop, what bother do you mean...?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  If I have to put it some way, man, I feel like a total mess... like I kinda, uh, miss home? It's not like I MISS that whole place, but... ugh, it's a mess, yeah? It's just a freaking mess!
[name="Aciddrop"]  I admit it! It's not even cool, is it? I know it's not cool! Say whatever you want, I don't care!

[name="Aciddrop"]  C'mon, why aren't you saying anything?
[name="Aciddrop"]  Every time you're like 'do not' this, 'do not' that, you make me think of someone... dunno how the hell that old geezer's doing now.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Doctor, do I sound very old?
[name="Lancet-2"]  I only have two years of factual age, and per certain young operators' feedback, Closure selected a voice for me that should sound proximal to their ages. Does it not?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  Haha, I'm not saying you're old.
[name="Aciddrop"]  It's just how you say things sometimes.
[name="Aciddrop"]  The old man used to really like harping on at me. Man, don't go skating there, it's dangerous. Don't be running around the block too late. Don't get too close to this or that...
[name="Aciddrop"]  ...Made me feel like my ears were gonna start shedding.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Ah, I more or less see the picture now.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Operator Aciddrop, you feel that I'm constantly nagging.
[name="Lancet-2"]  Ohh... It really isn't a charming mannerism at all... but whenever I see you utilizing your skateboard in the corridors, I just can't help but analyze the possibility of injury.
[name="Lancet-2"]  And within a period where your condition has not been better stabilized, excessive exercise can lead to the elevation of certain risk indicators...
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  I dig, I dig. You're looking out for us, yeah.
[name="Aciddrop"]  Honestly, it's kind of a weird feeling. Thinking about it now, like, back then it'd tick me off, and now I don't even get to hear it.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Operator Aciddrop, are you reminiscing about the past?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  Reminiscing, huh... Kinda tough to say I am, I guess. It ends up kinda lame, y'know, always thinking about the past and whatever.
[name="Aciddrop"]  Hey. Rhodes Island's a pretty solid place. It's got radical robots like you, too. Haha.
[name="Aciddrop"]  *Sigh*.
[name="Aciddrop"]  I'm sorry.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Um, are you apologizing to me, Operator Aciddrop?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  I'll try to stop skating in some places. That's what you want, right?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  I was just kinda talking crap yesterday, and E... uh, said there was something real fun I could try playing with.
[name="Aciddrop"]  At first I didn't actually think it'd work, and then when I heard you telling me in your normal voice to go to bed too late, it felt... a little awkward, deep down. Super awkward.
[name="Aciddrop"]  It was pretty wack. I mean, freedom is freedom... but I didn't feel any more relaxed. Actually just felt even more messed up.
[name="Aciddrop"]  Basically, I was wrong to do this.
[name="Aciddrop"]  And now you've busted me. What's my sentence? Do I get detention?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Oh, Rhodes Island has no custom of arbitrary detention. Besides, this isn't that big of a problem, is it?
[name="Lancet-2"]  Operator Aciddrop, in your hometown, convenient modification of otherwise inconvenient machines was quite a common sight, wasn't it?
[name="Lancet-2"]  I've seen it in your files. Both your hand crossbow and your skateboard have been through a certain degree of modification.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  No, that's twisted.
[name="Aciddrop"]  You're not that kinda machine.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Hm?
[Decision(options="As in, you're more than an ordinary machine.;I'm guessing she sees Lancet-2 as a friend?", values="1;2")]
[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Then that's all the less to worry about. As I view it, it's only a tiny, harmless prank.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  Does it count as a prank?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  A practical joke between friends conducted with mutual understanding. In my judgment, this meets the definition of a prank. Of course, robots cannot actually understand any sort of comedy.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Doctor, what do you think?
[Decision(options="Haha.", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  As you see, even the Doctor laughed. This proves that it truly is a prank, correct?
[name="Lancet-2"]  As it is a prank, I believe Dr. Kal'tsit and Amiya won't need to know about this. As of now, I have already resumed normal operation, and the Engineering Department will not save any files or data on an issue as minor as this.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1",name2="char_366_acdrop",focus=2)]
[name="Aciddrop"]  Huh. Thanks.
[Character(name="char_366_acdrop")]

[Predicate(references="1;2")]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Whenever you particularly want to drink coffee, I always advise against your continued consumption of it. Hearing it constantly does tend to be a bother, doesn't it?
[name="Lancet-2"]  Compared to one that always says 'do not,' I'm sure you'd much prefer a robot at your side that automatically serves you coffee when you want it—that would be far more obedient of a machine.
[name="Lancet-2"]  In that case, I ought to seek out Closure to decrease the frequency at which I say 'do not,' shouldn't I?
[name="Lancet-2"]  But that would be mutually incompatible with my intended purpose.
[name="Lancet-2"]  I am a medical robot. My purpose lies in ensuring the robust health of everyone at Rhodes Island.
[name="Lancet-2"]  And what I speak, you don't always listen to. It goes for Closure, too. She's just like you, Doctor. Constant overtime work, and an unhealthy diet.

[name="Lancet-2"]  It seems as if their excess activity actually works to their benefit... Perhaps I really am able to lower my frequency of 'do not' now.

[name="Lancet-2"]  Are they really kind words? I'm not too certain...
[name="Lancet-2"]  But in any case, they're quite pretty, aren't they? And Miss Melantha said so too.
