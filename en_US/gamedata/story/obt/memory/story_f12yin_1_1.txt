[name="Mountain"]At the time, I did not expect that I'd find myself in so many battles as an operator here, which is why I've never applied.

[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#7")]
[name="Mountain"]I'd just broken out of... Ahem, just left home. The equipment that Rhodes Island provides is more than adequate. There's not much I have to buy at my own expense, so this isn't a huge problem.

[name="Mountain"]Indeed, and as I've already mentioned, I'm not actually adamant about wearing this.
[name="Mountain"]However, I am rather fond of this style of attire. I've also noticed that the operators get rather personalized with the way they are dressed, so I thought I would ask if it would be possible.
[name="Mountain"]If it isn't, then I will apply for a more durable combat uniform.
[character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Logistics Operator"]Hmm... Well, we don't get requests like this that often.
[name="Logistics Operator"]Our operators may have pretty unique wardrobes, but their outfits don't get in the way most of the time.

[name="Bibeak"]I see... so you still can't see your parents, even now?
[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#7")]
[name="Mountain"]That's correct. One of the reasons I came to Rhodes Island is because I hope to be able to see them one day.
[name="Mountain"]At the beginning of those difficult times, I very much missed my parents.
[name="Mountain"]But as time went on, I also grew accustomed to life without them.
[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#11")]
[name="Mountain"]That is why I'm not certain whether this attire is something I choose to wear because I'm used to it or because I want it to serve as a reminder.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]Why not both? That doesn't seem too odd.
[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#7")]
[name="Mountain"]You're right...
[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#11")]
[name="Mountain"]Speaking of which, are you a dressmaker, Bibeak?
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]Oh, I'm not. I just like to do some sewing on my off time.
[name="Bibeak"]It's been a while since I joined Rhodes Island, and many of our operators know about this hobby of mine, so they sometimes come to me for this.
[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#11")]
[name="Mountain"]And, Orchid, you mentioned being a designer yourself?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]That's right. I used to be an editor at a fashion magazine.
[name="Orchid"]Most of Rhodes Island's uniforms are mass-produced, but many of the folks here have got interesting personalities and want something different.
[name="Orchid"]And that's when Bibeak and I shine.
[name="Orchid"]*Sigh*... I used to do this pretty willingly, but, as time went on, I started to feel like we could just keep everyone in their uniforms if they all have to come to me with their weird requests.
[name="Orchid"]Compared to all the other ones, this request is probably on the normal side.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]But isn't it really fun to make clothes for others? Some of our requests may be a little weird, but it's actually pretty fun to make those designs come true.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]Oh, my sweet child. Most everyone who says that ends up working themselves dead. Don't be so tolerant of others.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]I think you're pretty tolerant of everyone in A6, though...
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
The moment she hears that, Orchid rolls her eyes.

[name="Mountain"]Not at all. Something like what I'm wearing will do.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]

[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#11")]
[name="Mountain"]White will do.

[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]Yes.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]Even though you don't have any specific needs, we should probably work on a new design.
[name="Bibeak"]Oh, maybe I could modify the design I worked on last month!
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]The one you showed me?
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]Right.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]Nothing wrong with that design, but I'm afraid it's far too refined for Mountain.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]Hmm... You're right.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]We're not in a rush with either designing or making the outfit, and the choice of the fabric is what's important.
[name="Orchid"]I'll ask the Logistics operators in charge of uniforms. I'm sure they know what kind of fabrics are the right choice for combat suits.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]I'll come with you.
[name="Bibeak"]Formalwear needs to be pleasing to the eye. I'm not sure the fabrics they normally use for combat uniforms are good enough aesthetically.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]Well, I don't mind a little company, but isn't it about time for your mission?
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]

[name="Bibeak"]I'm very sorry. Is it okay if we go together after I come back?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]

[name="Mountain"]I like the design, and the fabrics you used are very sturdy.
[name="Mountain"]Much appreciated.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
[name="Bibeak"]No, I should thank you.
[name="Bibeak"]The choice of fabric actually bothered me for a long time. I couldn't find anything that I'm satisfied with.
[name="Bibeak"]But then I remembered some of the fabrics that my father used when he worked on his industrial outfits.
[name="Bibeak"]I never thought of using those in my outfit designs, but I took the chance to give it a try, and it worked surprisingly well.
[name="Bibeak"]This has been an eye-opening experience.
[character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#11")]
[name="Mountain"]I see. That's good to hear.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]I suppose designers normally don't use industrial materials for their work... though Rhodes Island is not the place for common sense.
[Character(name="char_252_bibeak_1")]
