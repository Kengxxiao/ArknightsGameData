[name="Nightingale"]Now... I'm going everywhere to find them.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]I can feel the pain of those who are sick and hurt, and I don't want them hurt anymore.
[name="Nightingale"]I stretch my hands out to them... to embrace their pain. I have my birdie sing in their ears.
[name="Nightingale"]I never expected the boy would see my birdie. He seemed so happy in his sleep.
[name="Nightingale"]When that happened, those shards that tied me down were gone... Birdie's steps became much lighter too.
[name="Nightingale"]Is that what it means to be happy? Shining, it sounds like I'm happy too.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Shining"]Okay... That's the answer I wanted.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Shining"]Yes, Liz. That's what it means to be happy. You know what it means to be happy now.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]Really? So this is how it's like to be happy. So now I... Mmm...
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Shining"]Does it make your heart ache?
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]Yes, Shining... It really makes my heart ache.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Nearl"]Why is this happening to Liz? She doesn't have the strength to stand up.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]This is the outcome of her choice.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Nearl"]Because she treated the kid last night...?
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]Yes, her condition was hardly optimal to begin with. Even the use of simple healing Arts takes its toll on her. Not to mention she was treating acute Oripathy. She's nearing her limits.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Nearl"]If I knew this was going to happen...
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]If you knew, would you have stopped her?
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]This is what I wanted to do... I wanted to heal the boy.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]See? This is what Liz wanted, even though it left her exhausted.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Nearl"]Right... I guess I wouldn't have been able to stop her.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]Exactly. This is a choice, and these are the choices you two have made. Like Liz, you always choose to sacrifice yourself to treat someone else's pain, whether visible or not.
[name="Shining"]I should've... respected your decisions.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]Shining...
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1")]
[name="Shining"]But my hope is that... Liz will have more choices available to her.
[name="Shining"]And you too, Margaret. My hope is that you will have more choices too.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]What does it mean to have more choices?
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Shining"]You've always wanted to see the world outside, don't you, Liz?
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Nightingale"]Yes, that's my greatest wish, Shining. I've been to so many places with you and Nearl.
[name="Nightingale"]These places are beautiful... Hatred and pain sometimes engulf these skies and lands, but that doesn't change the beauty that lies underneath.
[name="Nightingale"]I... I still want to see much more, and not just what the bird sings to me.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1",name2="char_147_shining_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Shining"]Yes, it's time we expand our horizons.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Nearl"]It sounds like you just made a decision, Shining.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]Nearl, do you remember the pharmaceutical company that the patient we treated last time mentioned?
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Nearl"]You mean... Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#2",name2="char_148_nearl_ns_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Shining"]Yes, Rhodes Island.

[name="Shining"]We've been wandering the world all these years. How many patients have we treated altogether?
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]I don't remember...
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1")]
[name="Shining"]It's okay if you don't remember, but, Liz, do you want to treat even more people out there?
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]Yes... I want to.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1")]
[name="Shining"]Okay. What about you, Nearl?
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_ns_1#1")]
[name="Nearl"]Rhodes Island, is it...? No objections here.
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_ns_1#5")]
[name="Nearl"]I trust you, and I trust your decision. If that's where Liz wants to go, then we'll take her there.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]We'll be together...
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#2")]
[name="Shining"]Together.
[Character(name="char_147_shining_1#1")]
[name="Shining"]We've made our decision. Let's go, then.
[Character(name="char_179_cgbird_1")]
[name="Nightingale"]Let's go...
[name="Nightingale"]...to Rhodes Island.
