[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Huh? Amiya, you're early here today.
[name="Savage"]There's no goods that need delivering today, and I've got nothing too urgent to deal with.
[name="Savage"]What's the matter, Amiya? Nothing on your plate today either?
[character(name="avg_npc_051")]
[name="Amiya"]Today, the Doctor, Kal'tsit, and Theresa went outside, and they wanted me to stay by myself in my room for now... and then they'd all come back at dinner.

[name="Savage"]Aaah, you don't need to wash that many! Good, just like that...
[name="Savage"]Hold on, you don't need your fingernails for carrots, you can just use a vegetable peeler... it's normal for them to be all bumpy. First time, after all.
[name="Savage"]It's a bit hard, kneading dough. Just leave that to me...

[name="Savage"]Yes, it's true. After that, I'll probably be heading back to work in Rim Billiton for a while.
[name="Savage"]I'm already an adult, so there are responsibilities I have to bear. Right now, Rim Billiton still has some things I need to finish.
[name="Savage"]But I'll come back to see you as soon as possible, Amiya. No matter how far apart we are, we're friends. So long as you need me to help, your big sis Savage'll come protect you.

[name="Amiya"]Mmhm... I know.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Right. Right, then, let's drop this subject. Who knows if Rim Billiton'll forget about me, and they won't call me back in, and I'll be stuck as an unemployed drifter...

[name="Amiya"]Also, I know, you like keeping me company... you look after me just like a real big sister would.
[name="Amiya"]I know it'll be very scary when you leave... but, cooking today made me really happy. Thanks to this memory, I won't be so scared in the future.
[Character(name="char_230_savage_1")]
[name="Savage"]Same for me, Amiya. Coming to Babel, getting to see you all happy finding me for a chat, playing together, cooking... I've been so glad all this time.
[name="Savage"]So, knowing we're about to part, I'm gonna be very sad too.
[name="Savage"]But, I won't ever let you look at me and worry.
[name="Savage"]Amiya, living upon this vast world, each of us has things we need to do.
[name="Savage"]You'll find your own direction, your own forward in the future, I promise. If we have the same beliefs... we'll definitely see each other again.

A normal, unremarkable day.

[name="Amiya"]She isn't just adept at food preparation, she's also very exact with raw ingredients too.
[name="Amiya"]Hmm... but I have no idea why tinned carrots from Rim Billiton were so hard to buy this year. They were the most important ingredient...
[name="Amiya"]It wasn't just rising prices. Procurement channels have dropped off, too.
[name="Amiya"]For Rim Billitonians, carrots are essentially a most beloved food, and demand far outstrips supply for them on the market. They get even scarcer when you want to order goods you can send to Rhodes Island...
[name="Amiya"]Of course, more places besides Rim Billiton grow carrots. There'll be all sorts of different varieties in places all unalike. But Savage said...
[name="Amiya"]'If it's not Rim Billiton's sweet, crisp kind, it's not gonna do, Amiya. I'll have you tasting the delicacy from your memories, just you wait!'
