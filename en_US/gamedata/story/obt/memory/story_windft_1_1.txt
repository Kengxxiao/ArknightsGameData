Gantt Jr. lies down on the bed, aching from a whole day of work.
He stares at the ceiling, where some of the paint has begun to peel off.
He closes his eyes and soon falls asleep.
In his dreams, he has taken over the operations of the factory. Everyone has new uniforms—including those hard hats worn by the workers on the posters—and lives in warm and spacious homes.
He turns over, a smile on his face, and knocks over a jar of medicine by his bedside.
