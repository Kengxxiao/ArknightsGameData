[name="Toddifons"]Hey, Zumama.
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#3$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Huh?
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#3$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Toddifons"]What do you reckon? If I fired off from this distance, would a heavy-duty fortcracker shot make it through Rhodes Island's outer armor?
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#3$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]......
[name="Eunectes"]Toddifons, if you ever want funds from my master again, I suggest you don't try.
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#2$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Toddifons"]Someone's no fun.
[name="Toddifons"]I was born in Victoria. Family of Vouivre, all immigrated from Sargon. Suppose we're from the same place, come to think. Sometimes my mam would even make Sargon stuff for dinner—supposedly, anyway.
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#2$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]Roast finmeat with plantains?
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#2$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Toddifons"]Barely as authentic. Just some red pepper tea and what have you...
[name="Toddifons"]They don't have it easy, Vouivre, finding footing in Victoria. They join the army, or they try blending in with the locals however. My family started running a factory, making... pulleys and stuff.
[name="Toddifons"]Not much amazing goes into that. Tear up some scrap, melt down to recast, keep the temperature steady, then pour it into circle molds. Anyone could do that.
[name="Toddifons"]It was like that until my granddad bought this lathe. Naff old second-hand model he got from who knows where, massive, heavy as all, used it for how many years.
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#3$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Toddifons"]Can you imagine, the first time it started up? It was horrible, obviously, but that massive din and the shaking, all those old parts coming to life... Couldn't even hear my own heartbeat.
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#3$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]More comforting than fighting ever was, right?
[Character(name="avg_363_toddi_1#3$1",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Toddifons"]Bloody right.
[name="Toddifons"]You said civilization and progress... We've never pointed to a lathe and said 'civilization.'
[name="Toddifons"]It just makes our lives that titchy bit better to live, that's all.
