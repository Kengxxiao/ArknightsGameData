[name="Blue Poison"]Hm... It's a new formula. Fresh cream mixed with a jam made from various kinds of berries. That gives it a sort of tropical flavor.
[Character(name="avgnew_129_bluep_1#1$1",name2="avg_326_glacus_1",focus=2)]
[name="Glaucus"]Sure, but its color is as terrifying as ever. Your fashion sense is pretty decent, so how the heck did your sense for food aesthetics end up downright rotten?

The Kerthun Valley is situated in a vast rainforest within Sargon's borders. Since time immemorial, it has never been under the direct control of the Sargonian lords ameer.
This was the most important factor in Rhodes Island's decision to build a safe house there.
There are many reasons for its unique geopolitical position. Data show that the area is abundant with natural resources, and many lords ameer have tried to expand their influence into the region.
Yet their efforts were all in vain.
[Character(name="avgnew_129_bluep_1#1$1",name2="avg_326_glacus_1",focus=2)]
[name="Glaucus"]The specific reasons require further investigation, but according to a local guide, it very likely has to do with the indigenous people.
[name="Glaucus"]Those natives are also the biggest variable in our mission. The guide said they aren't too hard to get along with, but also warned that they possess a terrifying ability.
