[name="Hoshiguma"]  When did you get here? Yesterday?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  Yep... I came with the Messenger convoy.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Rhodes Island's Messengers told me you'd left last month? What took you so long?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  Our convoy ran into a little trouble on the way. We came across a few Infected Creatures. We got lucky, though.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Well, I'm glad you got here in one piece.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  So you came all the way here just for this?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Here, this is who you're after.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Are you sure he's the one?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  Definitely... no question.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Looks like we're not the first you've turned to for help. You also asked Lee's Detective Agency, right?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  So who he is?

[name="Ethan"]  ......
[name="Ethan"]  A really good friend.

[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  My answer's still the same, Officer Hoshiguma. I am pretty sure that's him.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You still don't know how serious this is, don't you?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Do you know how much trouble this is going to be if he's actually the 'Kevin' you were talking about?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  Right, I know, I know.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  *Sigh*, Old Ch'en sure knows how to ruin my day.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Rhodes Island's position in Lungmen is delicate, to say the least, and the one you're looking for there... Well, it's a long story.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  This case is technically being taken on by a civilian agency, but, well...
[name="Hoshiguma"]  If things get out of hand, it's gonna be my head. You get that, right?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  Yeah, I get it, Madame Oni.
[name="Ethan"]  This is personal, though. Nothing to do with Rhodes Island. Relax.

The short Savra takes a look around the area.
The scars of war and the onslaughts the city has suffered are still clearly visible. The walls of the houses here, blown apart by cannon fire, have yet to be repaired. The damaged roads are still covered with fresh cement that has yet to dry.
Nonetheless, the morning streets are bustling, the slum dwellers are making their rounds, and the hawkers' peddling and the construction sounds nearby echo in unison.
The city is slowly recovering.

[Character(name="char_015_lmg", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Officer Kam"]  Don't say anything weird after we get inside. Do as I say.
[name="Officer Kam"]  The people here aren't all that friendly to outsiders.
[name="Officer Kam"]  Secondly, don't go running around, and don't go taking any strolls in the back alleys.
[name="Officer Kam"]  There are still some roads being repaired, and some of the buildings are really badly damaged and haven't been demolished yet.
[Character(name="char_015_lmg", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]

[name="Officer Kam"]  Here's a communicator. If things look like they're about the get hairy, call for help.

[Character(name="char_015_lmg", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Officer Kam"]  Just take it. Better safe than sorry.
[name="Officer Kam"]  It's almost Sauin. Everyone at the department's got plenty to do.
[name="Officer Kam"]  You're not from here, and the Infected district's situation's complicated. You don't know what it's like.
[name="Officer Kam"]  If things go wrong, the cops around won't get to you in time.

[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  The folks here live a difficult life. If you kill me here, the L.G.D. will shut the whole place down. It'd be a big pain for my neighbors.

[name="Kevin"]  You can drop the act. I understand.
[name="Kevin"]  You left Reunion and went somewhere else.
[name="Kevin"]  Going by that trendy getup, it's gotta be a great place, eh?
[name="Kevin"]  Most Infected don't get to live as good of a life as you do.
[name="Kevin"]  But if you want to keep living that high life, you still have one last obstacle.
[name="Kevin"]  That's people like us.
[name="Kevin"]  I know who you are. I know you used to be Reunion.
[name="Kevin"]  Once I'm dead, you won't have anyone to rat you out anymore. No one will ever know you were cut from the same cloth as us lowlifes.

[name="Ethan"]  I spent all my money this year just to ask around, just to find you guys.
[name="Ethan"]  I held out hope that you were doing okay, that you made it through everything alive.
[name="Ethan"]  Looks like I shouldn't have.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  How could I be...?
[name="Ethan"]  I don't know what you've been through these last few years, but I've always thought of you as a brother.
[name="Ethan"]  Back when we were starving in Kazimierz, you stole a few cans of food just for the rest of us, and you got beaten up so bad.
[name="Ethan"]  When we were out in the wilderness, you fought off those bandits with Packy. That's how I'm still alive.
[name="Ethan"]  I'm grateful for you guys. If it wasn't for you, I would've died out there a long time ago.
[name="Ethan"]  That's why I came here to look for you.
[name="Ethan"]  But I kinda regret it now.

[name="Kevin"]  I didn't mean it. I just thought that...
[name="Kevin"]  *Sigh*...
[name="Kevin"]  A lot has happened these past few years. I've gotten a lot more suspicious.

Kevin puts on a tattered Industrial Arts casting glove and takes out a few bottles of light yellow soda. He tightly squeezes the glass bottles with both his hands. Before long, the surface of the bottles has begun to frost up.

[name="Ethan"]  When did you learn to use Arts like this...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  Remember that group of soldiers from up north?
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  You mean... the Yetis?
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  That's right.
[name="Kevin"]  After you left, I was assigned to the Airborne unit with a few other guys.
[name="Kevin"]  We worked with the Yetis for a very long time. 
[name="Kevin"]  They're the ones who taught me this. I don't have much talent for Arts. All I can do is chill a few bottles of soda.
[name="Kevin"]  They were good people. FrostNova, too.
[name="Kevin"]  But they're all dead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  So what happened to the others...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  Packy died on our way to Lungmen. You know how serious his Oripathy was.
[name="Kevin"]  Waltz... The Lungmen squads killed him when he tried to shield the others.

[name="Kevin"]  I'm alive only because I got lucky.
[name="Kevin"]  My jetpack broke down midflight. I crash-landed right in the garbage collector.
[name="Kevin"]  By the time I came to, the war was over already.
[name="Kevin"]  You know the most pathetic part? It was the junkmen from the slums here who found me. They dug me up from the mounds of trash, and that's how I'm still here.

[name="Kevin"]  Take a look at the people here.
[name="Kevin"]  They're all normal folks. There are some Infected too.
[name="Kevin"]  All of them have their own lives.
[name="Kevin"]  But, back then, that thought never so much as crossed my mind.
[name="Kevin"]  When I took up arms, I really thought I was fighting for all the Infected out there.
[name="Kevin"]  Looking back, I guess I was just some rioter who smashed and burned everything in my tracks.
[name="Kevin"]  In the end, I'm not even sure what I was doing these last couple years.
[name="Kevin"]  In hindsight, I guess you were the one who really tried to figure it all out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  I don't actually want to figure anything out.
[name="Ethan"]  I'm not as ambitious as you're making me out to be.
[name="Ethan"]  As long as I don't go hungry and I get a place to call home, that's good enough for me.
[name="Ethan"]  But charging into somebody's house, dragging them out, and then beating them up, hurting them...
[name="Ethan"]  I may be an Infected, but to do all that just to get by? No way, not me.
[name="Ethan"]  I'm not one to talk about righteousness, but that just isn't right. I know it.
[name="Ethan"]  And that's why I left Reunion.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  *Sigh*...
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  This stuff...
[name="Kevin"]  How much do they cost...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ethan"]  Don't worry about it.
[name="Ethan"]  They don't actually sell them out on the market. Just take them yourself, and don't let anybody know.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kevin"]  Right...
[name="Kevin"]  Hey, hold on...

[Character(name="avg_npc_080", name2="char_355_ethan_1", focus=1)]
