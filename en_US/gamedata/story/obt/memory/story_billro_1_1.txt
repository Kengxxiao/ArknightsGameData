At first, joining Rhodes Island was only a stopgap measure.
The young Count is afflicted with a disgraceful disease and must mix with Leithanien's upper crust while hiding his identity as an Infected.
He is still a boy, but his demeanor is already like that of a seasoned veteran.
But in Carnelian's eyes, instead of a dignified image, he instead reminds her of a young, seriously injured beast who had lost its parents that she once saw.
Confronted by hunters, it bared its fangs and raised its hackles, feigning the last bit of dignity it could manage as a wild beast.
In the beginning, that was the only reason why she chose to stick her nose into that.
And the agreement she signed with Rhodes Island was but one of the many insignificant things she had no choice but to do at the time.

Rhodes Island accepts people of all kinds. Some came together because of how like-minded they are, but even more of them, like her, opted to stay a while for all kinds of reasons.
From the bottom of her heart, Carnelian feels truly gratified, knowing that Ankhesena has been able to broaden her horizons, learn to think for herself, as well as understand and accept Rhodes Island's ideals.
Even though she herself only follows her heart, Carnelian thinks that, perhaps while she's around all these adorable Rhodes Islanders, she should restrain herself a little and work with them.
If she hangs around them long enough, perhaps she too will be influenced by them and become softer?

[name="Carnelian"]*sigh*... Kids really do grow up so fast...

[name="Carnelian"]Well, seems I'll be going back in shame if I don't work a little harder.
