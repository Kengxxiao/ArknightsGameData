[name="Field Operator"]  Don't be alarmed, I mean you no harm. I'm employed by a pharmaceutical company named Rhodes Island. I'm responsible for field work in this area. Here, this is my work ID.
[Character(name="char_158_milu")]
[name="Firewatch"]  That doesn't prove anything. IDs and papers and whatever can all be forged.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Field Operator"]  Fair enough, they can. Haha, you're just like I heard. An extremely cautious youngster.
[Character(name="char_158_milu")]
[name="Firewatch"]  Heard? From who?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Field Operator"]  Oh, jeez, don't get all tense again.
[name="Field Operator"]  Look, I'm serious, I'm not anyone bad. I don't even have any weapons that big or lethal on me. At best, I've got a couple of tools for defending myself from beasts.
[name="Field Operator"]  I've got nothing on you. I see that crossbow of yours... look, it's still right there. You could reach out and grab it.
[name="Field Operator"]  Can we have a real talk now?
[Character(name="char_158_milu")]
[name="Firewatch"]  If you're up to something, you'll regret having stepped into this forest.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Field Operator"]  Yes. I believe you. The crossbow in your hands has already told me that much.
[Character(name="char_158_milu")]
[name="Firewatch"]  Right now, you need to tell me. Who was it that told you anything about me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Field Operator"]  That's... er...
[name="Field Operator"]  There's been reports of a very young Elafia girl who's been all around the northern villages of Kazimierz lately, looking for any leads on a specific group. Plenty of people have been picking up on it, actually.
[Character(name="char_158_milu")]
[name="Firewatch"]  The footprints left behind when tracking prey.
[name="Firewatch"]  I wouldn't have made a mistake like that in the past... but I don't care that I have.
[name="Firewatch"]  Who told you to look for me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Field Operator"]  That'd be Rhodes Island. Just like I introduced earlier, Rhodes Island is a pharmaceutical company, doing business in all areas. They've been seeking all sorts of suitable talent, too, and they'd like to invite you to join.
[Character(name="char_158_milu")]
[name="Firewatch"]  A pharmaceutical company?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  Did you drug me just now?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Only some nutritional supplements and a simple first-aid medication. I'm no Medic Operator. I personally can't give you any better of an examination, nor further treatment.
[name="Field Operator"]  You look a good bit better now, luckily. Your injuries should be holding decently. If we want any further diagnosis, you'll need to come back to Rhodes Island with me.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  To treat me. And you want to hire me.
[name="Firewatch"]  Seeing as you've investigated, you should already know. I don't understand the first thing about medicine. The only thing I can do is fight.
[name="Firewatch"]  So, what would a pharmaceutical company want a hired bow for?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Er... oh, boy, that one... er, like I said earlier, Rhodes Island does a lot of business, and frequently comes into contact with a lot of different people in a lot of different areas.
[name="Field Operator"]  And during those contacts, we unavoidably run into some emergencies.
[name="Field Operator"]  At times like that, we need people with special skills like yours, to help give Rhodes Island a fighting chance.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  Whether person or organization, you have to have strength if you want to survive.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Right. I'm sure you can understand.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  But my strength has other uses.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Do you mean those people you're looking for?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  Yes.
[name="Firewatch"]  Every day I haven't found them is one more day my footsteps will not cease.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  I understand... I'm not too clear about your past, but it's a very common thing, isn't it? Just like us inside Rhodes Island. We've got scores of operators, all with their own differing and individual attachments.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  Is that so?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  We won't ever interfere in an operator's private affairs, and outside of missions, everyone has freedom.
[name="Field Operator"]  Beyond that, when an operator needs it, providing aid doesn't go against our standards, Rhodes Island will provide whatever you want—medical service, crucial information, or necessary strength.
[name="Field Operator"]  It's why a good few Operators chose to join Rhodes Island, really.
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  Then the people I need to find...
[name="Firewatch"]  Can Rhodes Island help me there?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  It's not my place to say anything else. Just, us helping you look for someone—that'd be more effective than you going it alone around Kazimierz, or even areas beyond, right?
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Firewatch"]  ......
[Character(name="char_158_milu",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Field Operator"]  Alone, you probably wouldn't hold out for too long. You're short on supplies, and you don't have any help.
[name="Field Operator"]  I'll be honest, you're not in the best of shape right now. If you need to find someone, accomplish some goal, then first you need to ensure your survival, right?
[name="Field Operator"]  How do I put it? In our world, if you want to get something done, even if it's as bare and simple as staying alive, a bunch of heads all together always beats one.
