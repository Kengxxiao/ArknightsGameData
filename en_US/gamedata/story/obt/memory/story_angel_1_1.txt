[name="Exusiai"]  I always thought I was a pretty brave girl, but I clearly remember being scared into a cold sweat. Just thinking about it now still makes my hands shake.
[name="Exusiai"]  Not even kidding. At the time, I hadn't sorted things through in my head, and I nearly jumped into a fight with the one who brought my sister back.

[name="Exusiai"]  Bingo, the very same. After bringing my sister back, she immediately disappeared to Lord-knows-where.

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#5", name2="char_101_sora_1#2", focus=1)]

[name="Sora"]  Um, how do I put it... So it's like...
[name="Sora"]  That whole thing with you joining up, plus the fact that you always try to cut the conversation short every time Mostima's name comes up, I just assumed you had some bad blood with her.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3", name2="char_101_sora_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]  If we're talking about how Mostima always dragged my sister into working overtime, and how many times that ended with me getting stood up, then yeah, we do have some bad blood.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3", name2="char_101_sora_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sora"]  Huh? You knew each other as kids?
