[name="Brave Child"]  Hey—Hey! Is anyone here?!
[name="Brave Child"]  ......
[name="Brave Child"]  It's gotten really dark... I just walked past the school, the cake shop, and the tailor shop that Rolena's mom used to run...
[name="Brave Child"]  If I keep going straight, I'll be in the next district.
[name="Brave Child"]  Dammit... This road is barely walkable. Those nutjobs with the masks... Everything's changed all of a sudden, thanks to them.
[name="Brave Child"]  Yuri! Yuri, where are you?!
[name="Brave Child"]  We were together just a moment ago... I was just trying to get us some water that we can drink!
[name="Brave Child"]  Yuri's the youngest, and he's the most hurt. Where could he have gone by himself? Right, his wound was still bleeding... If I look out for the smell of blood... Uhh... It smells like blood everywhere.

[name="Brave Child"]  Ugh, it stinks.
[name="Brave Child"]  No, I can't throw up. It took Oleg so long to find us dinner in the ruins.
[name="Brave Child"]  Yuri—

[name="Brave Child"]  There it is again. It doesn't sound like the wind. Could it really be...?
[name="Brave Child"]  Yuri! Yuri, is that you?
[name="Brave Child"]  It quieted down. Am I too far away? What was behind the wall again...? The department store's old storeroom?
[name="Brave Child"]  The storeroom's been empty the whole time, and the adults would never let us close to it. Oleg even said before that he'd help us sneak inside one day.
[name="Brave Child"]  Did Yuri come in here by himself? It's so dark... I can't see through the gaps. Dammit, I guess I'm gonna have to climb inside.
[name="Brave Child"]  It's even darker in here. My face's all sticky... Is it the rain that dripped in from outside? Urgh, it smells...
[name="Brave Child"]  Now I remember... The girls in school said there's something weird inside the storeroom.
[name="Brave Child"]  It's gotta be fake.
[name="Brave Child"]  But... I've already seen so many weird things going on these past few days...
[name="Brave Child"]  No, don't think about that right now, Anton. Don't be scared. You still need to find Yuri.

[name="Brave Child"]  Yuri, is that you?
[name="Scared Child"]  Anton...? Anton?
[name="Brave Child"]  Yeah, it's me. I'm here. You don't need to be scared no more. I'll climb over there. Give me a second.
[name="Scared Child"]  Help... Help me...
[name="Brave Child"]  Hang in there. I'm almost there. What happened anyway? Why'd you run this far on your own all a sudden?
[name="Brave Child"]  Isn't your leg hurt...?
[name="Scared Child"]  Uhh... *Sobs*... T-There was a monster...
[name="Brave Child"]  A monster? What are you talking about, Yuri? Do you have a fever?
[name="Scared Child"]  A monster... brought me here...
[name="Brave Child"]  ......
[name="Brave Child"]  The monster you're talking about... What does it look like?
[name="Scared Child"]  I... I couldn't get a good look... I think it had black claws... And it had red eyes! It stared at me. I-I was so scared, I didn't know what was going on at all.
[name="Brave Child"]  Black claws and red eyes? I think I heard of that before.
[name="Brave Child"]  Oh yeah, that's the ghost story that Lina from school talked about, right?
[name="Scared Child"]  Yeah... Lina said... She said any kids that don't go to bed at night will get a visit from the monster.
[name="Scared Child"]  It'll keep staring at you, and if your eyes are open and lock onto her red eyes, your soul will get sucked out right away.
[name="Scared Child"]  You'll turn into something like a marionette. You'll climb off your bed with the monster and follow it outside and onto the street. Then you'll keep following it... until you reach its nest.
[name="Scared Child"]  There, the monster will hang you up on the eaves... Just like how we hang sausages at home...
[name="Scared Child"]  And when it's hungry... It'll come suck your blood, one mouthful after another until your body's bone dry.
[name="Scared Child"]  *Sobs*... Anton, I can't possibly have...
[name="Brave Child"]  Stop it. You're scaring yourself. This is just something the adults made up to get us to go to bed early, I'm sure of it.
[name="Scared Child"]  R-Really?
[name="Brave Child"]  Well, think about it. Did it hang you up?
[name="Scared Child"]  I... There's something holding my leg... Somewhere up high...

[name="Scared Child"]  *sobs*... Anton... I don't wanna be eaten by the monster...
[name="Brave Child"]  It's okay. I'll be there soon. We just gotta be fast. I'll carry you back before that mon... Before whatever it is comes back.
[name="Scared Child"]  Yeah... N-No... Anton, stay away! Go back!

[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  You're... scaring us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Let me explain.
[name="Guard Operator"]  Little buddy? I found your friend while I was out on a mission. He was all alone, and it looked like he was hurt pretty bad.
[name="Guard Operator"]  I was worried about his safety, so I brought him here. He was kind of drifting off and passed out halfway through, so I couldn't explain to him what was going on.
[name="Guard Operator"]  Dr. Warfarin is one of our top doctors. She's very experienced. You can trust her to patch your friend up.
[name="Guard Operator"]  Oh, and you know how she took a bit of your blood just now? She was just taking a blood sample to run some tests.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  Tests...?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  Okay, the results are out. What's that Ursus saying again? Hmm, this young man is as lively as a wild burdenbeast.
[name="Warfarin"]  Congratulations, boy. You are not infected yet.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  Infected... You mean Oripathy?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  That's right. These days, you're probably one of the luckiest ones around if you're both alive and uninfected in Chernobog.
[name="Warfarin"]  Your friend there isn't quite as lucky.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  Is something wrong with Yuri?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  All I can say is we took care of him before it's too late, and you've got me. If Folinic had been in charge of the area, he probably wouldn't have gotten such a wonderful patch up job.

[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Ahem... If she heard that, I'm sure she'd be mad.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]  And what do I care if she's mad? She still has much to learn.
[name="Warfarin"]  Can she figure out right away where the Originium crystals are building up just going by the changes in the smell of his blood?
[name="Warfarin"]  For patients like him, who just started to show symptoms, we need to do more than just take care of their wounds to keep the infection from progressing. We also need to prevent the Originium that's already in their bodies from forming leisons around the wounds.
[name="Warfarin"]  The suppressants that are out on the market can only alleviate symptoms. Even if I'm on the case, the most I can do is minimize the risk of the disease getting any worse.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  Did you hang Yuri's leg up like that to help him?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  Well...
[name="Warfarin"]  Yeah... I guess? This is an idea I've wanted to try out for a while. In his case, it should be more effective by a few percentage points.
[name="Warfarin"]  It's so low, I guess it's probably within the margin of error? I might need to find a few more patients to test this out on...

[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=-1)]
[name="Scared Child"]  *Whimpers*...
[name="Brave Child"]  I get it, you saved us.
[name="Brave Child"]  Thanks...
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  You can thank me later. We need to keep your friend, this Yuri boy, under observation to see how his condition turns out.
[name="Warfarin"]  If he actually becomes Infected...
[name="Warfarin"]  Well, let's not go into that right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Hey, Anton? You can rest up a little here with Yuri. Once it's bright outside, I'll take you two to our camp.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  Your camp?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Guard Operator"]  That's right. We have a camp here. We'll be pulling out of Chernobog soon. When that happens, we'll escort you two to a nearby Ursus city.
[name="Guard Operator"]  That is... if Yuri doesn't show any signs of further infection.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012", focus=-1)]
[name="Brave Child"]  There's Oleg and the others too. There are five of us. We're together.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Guard Operator"]  Is that so? Okay. I'll look for them, then. Dr. Warfarin will give them a checkup too.

[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Guard Operator"]  *cough*, she's a very skilled doctor. It's just... when you're strapped on the operating table all of a sudden, it does kinda give you chills.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  That's just your instincts at work. I forgive you.
[name="Warfarin"]  It's like sandworms running into a Metal Crab, or some other tiny meatbeasts running into more ferocious beasts. Of course you'd be scared coming face to face with a Vampire.
[name="Warfarin"]  And you better stay scared. Most Vampires out there aren't nearly as nice as me or Closure.

[name="Guard Operator"]  Ha... Haha.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  Hm... Back to our little buddy's question—
[name="Warfarin"]  Maybe half-and-half?
[Character]
[name="Brave Child"]  Half-and-half?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  My interest in blood doesn't manifest as thirst anymore.
[Character]
[name="Brave Child"]  So... a monster then?
[name="Brave Child"]  So you don't get mad... if you're called a monster?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  Well... to you, I am a monster, no doubt about that.
[name="Warfarin"]  I've never wished for you people to treat me as your own kind, and I don't see the other races as my equals either.
[name="Warfarin"]  And well, if I'm a monster just because I'm unlike the others... then everyone out there can be called a monster too.
[name="Warfarin"]  For example, if your friend Yuri actually becomes infected, then a lot of people will call him a monster.
[Character]
[name="Brave Child"]  ......
[name="Brave Child"]  I won't. I won't call him a monster.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  What about the others? It's won't be easy for you to change how they see him.
[Character]
[name="Brave Child"]  If they insist on calling him a monster, I'll fight them off.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  See? You're mad, aren't you?
[name="Warfarin"]  You'll fight them off, and they'll fight back. Even if nobody dies in all that fighting, it'll be a waste of time, don't you think?
[Character]
[name="Brave Child"]  A waste of time...?
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  Yes, a waste of time. While you're angry, your friend may die of his disease.
[name="Warfarin"]  If you take a step back and think it through slowly, you'll find that, instead of being angry, it makes more sense to spend your energy working out more important or meaningful things.
[name="Warfarin"]  For you, hm... I suppose that's figuring out how you want to live?
[Character]
[name="Brave Child"]  Live... Right, we want to live.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1")]
[name="Warfarin"]  That's right! And if you want to live a better life, you need to learn to accept that you are different and then figure out how to get along with others.
[name="Warfarin"]  One more thing, buddy. Once you grow up, be sure to travel to all kinds of places and see what it's like everywhere.
[name="Warfarin"]  That way, you will probably come to understand that... being seen as a monster is nothing worth getting angry over.
