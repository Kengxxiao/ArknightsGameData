[name="Sora"]  We've got long, stable relationships with Infected clients. Oripathy isn't something you can catch from physical contact.
[name="Sora"]  Don't worry. All Penguin Logistics staff have received Oripathy prevention training. You can't hurt me.

[name="Sora"]  But the handwriting in the appreciation letter to Penguin Logistics is the same as the fan letter I got.
[name="Sora"]  She didn't leave an address or a name. It was just a simple thank you letter, but I know it. It was you.
[name="Sora"]  ...I just... want to see you once again...
[name="Sora"]  Are you willing to see me? Should... I even see you?
[name="Sora"]  There is something I want to tell you face to face. I want to tell you that you've got to cheer up and find hope again.

Sora subconsciously places her hand on the edge of her pocket. Slowly, she takes out the letter.
On the old, tattered envelope are the words 'To Miss Sora.'
Sora has read the letter inside and compared it with the letter of appreciation countless times. Its contents have been etched into her soul—
Not only do the words of appreciation within evoke her nostalgia, they help keep her mind at ease.
[name="Sora"]  How come I can't find you? I saw you around here not too long ago... Have you really gone somewhere else?
