[name="Guard Operator"]  You should talk more. Try to express yourself if you don't want people to get the wrong idea. I mean, yesterday was the perfect example.
[Character(name="char_356_broca", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_356_broca", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  You mean you don't trust Rhodes Island?

[name="Guard Operator"]  Really, though, hear me out on this one. You really shouldn't talk like that. The first thing you said was 'I don't trust Rhodes Island.' What kind of impression do you think that gives the rest of us?
[Character(name="char_356_broca#2", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Broca"]  I don't...

[name="Guard Operator"]  Eh, stop right there, bro. I'm not trying to say you're hurting anyone's feelings or to tell you to shape up or anything. It's just, well, how should I say   this...?
[name="Guard Operator"]  You see, I used to be a mercenary, and I've worked for organizations before, too. When I first got here, it was purely transactional. I was just here to make a living.
[name="Guard Operator"]  They treat us well, and the food's not bad, but that's about it. If you'd asked me back then, I probably would've told you I don't believe in that good, charitable company bull crap.
[name="Guard Operator"]  I mean, all the big companies are basically the same. You feel the same way too, no?
[Character(name="char_356_broca", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=1)]
[name="Broca"]  Sure.
[Character(name="char_356_broca", name2="avg_npc_012", focus=2)]
[name="Guard Operator"]  But anyway, I've been here for a while, and I can tell. Rhodes Island is different. This is something you need to learn yourself. Ain't nobody can teach you that.
[name="Guard Operator"]  And yes, I trust Amiya, I trust the Doctor, and I trust Dr. Kal'tsit. They all won   me over.
[name="Guard Operator"]  I didn't snap because the way you were talking bugged me. I snapped because what you said was wrong. You know what I mean?

[name="Guard Operator"]  Eh, it's all good. I'm not telling you to figure it all out right now. What I'm trying to say is Rhodes Island isn't quite like what you think it is. You should try to trust in us a little more.
