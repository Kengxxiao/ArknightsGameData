[name="Vanguard Operator B"]  What, you haven't heard? There's some rock band putting on a concert at the city we're stopped next to. Vigna's been looking forward to it for days.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[name="Vanguard Operator B"]  That's right. You did a great job. You were a little worked up, but your judgment is just as great as always. You did everything you were meant to do. You've grown up, Vigna.

[name="Vigna"]  What's wrong?
[Character(name="char_290_vigna",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Well, here's the deal.
[name="Logistics Operator"]  When Team C was chasing away the beasts, they were attacked by what they thought was the pack leader. There were a lot of them, too, so the team decided to retreat.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]

[name="Vanguard Operator A"]  What are you so cocky about? I knew this was going to happen too!
[Character(name="avg_npc_088")]
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Our contract with the city government stipulates that we have to eliminate the threat of the beasts that's keeping their residents locked down.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=1)]
[name="Vanguard Operator B"]  So you mean we have to go back and take care of this threat once and for all?
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]  That's right. Of course, because of the change in plans, we're reorganizing the mission roster. You don't have to participate if you don't want to.
[Character(name="avg_npc_088",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Vanguard Operator A"]  Well, how can we possibly back out after you told us all that?
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Vanguard Operator B"]  That's right. We'll see it through, but well...
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_290_vigna",focus=1)]
[name="Vanguard Operator B"]  Vigna, you still have your concert, right? Just go. Leave this to the rest of us.
[Character(name="char_290_vigna",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]  Huh? Concert?
[Character(name="char_290_vigna",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=1)]
[name="Vigna"]  Yeah... It's starting in a few hours.
[Character(name="char_290_vigna",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]  I see. You should get going, then. Don't worry about us.
[Character(name="char_290_vigna",name2="avg_npc_088",focus=1)]
[name="Vigna"]  I can't do that...
[name="Vigna"]  I'm going on this mission too.
[Character(name="char_290_vigna",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Vanguard Operator A"]  Don't worry about us. This is nothing too tough. The beasts have a leader, that's all. We can handle it ourselves.
[Character(name="char_013_riop",name2="char_290_vigna",focus=1)]
[name="Vanguard Operator B"]  That's right. Didn't you say you love this band? Just leave it to us and enjoy the concert.
