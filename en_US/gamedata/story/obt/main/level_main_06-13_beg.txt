[name="Reunion Caster"]  What the hell?
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Yeti Squad, why have you stopped firing? What are you waiting for?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  ...Dig out those ruins, huh?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Didn't you plant the Originium? Why not collapse the whole plate and wipe out Rhodes Island all at once?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Are you kidding? FrostNova is still down there!
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Then we'll deal with Rhodes Island. You guys keep digging. We'll be right there.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Not on this block! The superstructure in this sector is completely shredded. An untrained team fighting here could induce a total collapse!
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Wiping out Rhodes Island is a top priority. You take care of it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  I'm not gonna argue with you. We'll fight what we gotta fight. Who decided on this priority anyway?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  It's obviously our most important strategic goal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Were you thinking about strategic goals when you vented your anger on the Ursus?
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  We'll do what we can. Give us some space.
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Did you... communicate with Rhodes Island?
[name="Reunion Caster"]  You're betraying the Movement!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  ......
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5")] 
[name="Blaze"]  (What's going on over there?)
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  (I think we have to fight.)
[playsound(key="$d_gen_transmissionget", volume=0.4)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  If you think communication is tantamount to betrayal then that's your prerogative. 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  With that kind of tactical thinking, it's no wonder you're getting led around by the nose.
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  ...Yetis! What are you up to?!
[name="Reunion Caster"]  We outnumber you a hundred times over, don't be stupid!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  ...Come on, we fought the Ursus Standing Army like a million times, who's getting excited over a big angry mob?
[Character]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Just you wait!

[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  (Static)
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Hey, Rhodes Island. We might have to teach those unruly bastards a lesson.
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  You should probably stay out of it. We don't want to be accused of collaborating with the enemy.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5")] 
[name="Blaze"]  Huh? Collaborating? What are you talking about?
[name="Blaze"]  Amiya, what happened in the ruins, and what's the official party line on it?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=2)] 
[name="Amiya"]  ......Nothing happened. We were fighting Yeti Squad and no other Reunion units joined the battle.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#8")] 
[name="Blaze"]  Acting? I'm a phenomenal actress.
[name="Blaze"]  What do you say we put on a show and then take care of these guys in the ensuing chaos?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Sounds good to me. What does your captain think?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")] 
[name="Amiya"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=2)] 
[name="Amiya"]  Excuse me, sir. How should I call you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  ...Um, well, you're a really cute girl, but I'm not sure I'm ready for anything like that...
[Character]
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  Ready for what? What are you thinking?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)] 
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Oh, sorry. I'm just playing around. You can call me Yeti #1, I guess.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=2)] 
[name="Amiya"]  All right, Mr. Yeti #1... We've got lives to save, don't we?
[name="Amiya"]  So let's subdue the Reunion units that could interfere with our rescue mission.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)] 
[name="Mr. Yeti #1"]  Yeah. I'm plenty motivated now.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#9")] 
[name="Blaze"]  ...And where exactly did you get that motivation?
