[name="Meteorite"]   ...I've reached the destination.
[name="Meteorite"]   No other abnormalities found.
[name="Meteorite"]   Report complete.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1")]
[name="Meteorite"]   Frostleaf, why were you frowning the whole way here?
[Character(name="char_193_frostl_1")]
[name="Frostleaf"]   I'm just a little concerned about Amiya's group.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1" )]
[name="Meteorite"]   They've already safely returned to Rhodes Island.
[name="Meteorite"]   Nearl and Dobermann already left Lungmen a week ago for their next assignment.
[name="Meteorite"]   It must be a pretty tough mission if it required sending those two together.
[name="Meteorite"]   Blacksteel and Penguin Logistics both have their own matters to attend to.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]   Oh, Liskarm and Franka...
[name="Jessica"]   I'm... I'm glad that they're safe...
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="char_219_meteo_1", focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]   You've got to work hard as well, just like them.
[name="Meteorite"]   When Franka sent you over to me, she spoke very highly of you.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="char_219_meteo_1", focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]   R-really...?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1", name2="char_219_meteo_1", focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]   If only you weren't so timid, she said.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1#4", name2="char_219_meteo_1", focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]   Uuu....
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1#4", name2="char_219_meteo_1", focus=2)]
[name="Meteorite"]   ...Hey, don't act like you're about to start crying!
[name="Meteorite"]   Aren't you also a member of Blacksteel...?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1#5", name2="char_219_meteo_1", focus=1)]
[name="Jessica"]   I, I'm not... crying...
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1")]
[name="Meteorite"]   ...
[name="Meteorite"]   ...In any case, let's continue our mission.
[name="Meteorite"]   Our next task is to work with the other recon teams to scout out this entire city.
[name="Meteorite"]   Other than searching for survivors, we also need to assess the situation.
[name="Meteorite"]   If we encounter hostile Infected, we'll have to deal with the threat quickly.
[name="Meteorite"]   Even though our mission isn't particularly dangerous, it's still best to proceed with caution.
[name="Meteorite"]   In the event that Reunion is involved in this, we'll retreat immediately and report back to Dr Kal'tsit.
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]   Mmhm, mmhm!
[Character(name="char_193_frostl_1")]
[name="Frostleaf"]   Understood.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1")]
[name="Meteorite"]   All that's left for us to do... is to focus on our job.

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   There are many things in Rhodes Island that must be taken care of...
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Liskarm"]   I can understand that, but make sure not to give yourself too much pressure, Amiya.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]   No matter how strong your will is, your body won't be able to keep up if you get exhausted.
[name="Franka"]   You'd better not get sick. Everyone's counting on you!
