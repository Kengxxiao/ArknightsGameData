[name="PRTS"]  Number 00000-00002, Clearance Level-8.
[name="PRTS"]  Dr. {@nickname}, thank you for visiting the Rhodes Island Integrated Bioprocessing Unit. Your intentions have been determined through analysis of available biological data.
[name="PRTS"]  In addition, the system detects that you are in a bad mood.
[Decision(options="Leave me alone.;......;And what would count for a good mood?", values="1;2;3")]

[name="PRTS"]  Dr. {@nickname} is displaying aggression.
[name="PRTS"]  Rest assured the system will not electrocute you. There is no need to fear these tests.

[Character]
[name="PRTS"]  Dr. {@nickname} fell silent.
[name="PRTS"]  Whether silent protest or refusal to communicate, I believe it is an expression of an autism spectrum disorder.
[name="PRTS"]  Please, by all means. The system treats all equally.
[Predicate(references="3")]
[Character]
[name="PRTS"]  Good and bad are subjective judgments.
[name="PRTS"]  However, this system has collected nearly all documented states of mental activity, as well as hormonal criteria for various types of neurological excitement.
[name="PRTS"]  So you could argue that the system's subjective judgment is substantially closer to objective truth.
[name="PRTS"]  Therefore, no matter what action Dr. {@nickname} may take, the system will be able to process it to some degree.
[name="PRTS"]  Which is to say: you may do as you wish.
[name="PRTS"]  PRTS is equipped with a nonlethal pacification function.
[name="PRTS"]  Should you take unreasonable action, you will lose consciousness for 3.55 working hours, ensuring you maintain a behavioral standard close to normal.

[name="???"]  This is where all of Rhodes Island's Infected end up.
[name="???"]  And if I knew them, if I felt them, if they were my teammates, I always take care of them myself.
[name="???"]  The original manual was really complicated, but I wrote down how to use it in my terminal. Just a quick look and I can feel it.

[Decision(options="A chain...?", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="???"]  Or I could say it's like seeing the links between people.
[name="???"]  Sending off the people tied to you means untangling the lines around them. The other ends of the threads are still tied to us, but even when the one side is gone, the threads don't hang down.
[name="???"]  It feels like you've lost something inside yourself. Something you didn't know was there, but knowing it won't come back. 
[Decision(options="Why would you want to feel that?", values="1")]
