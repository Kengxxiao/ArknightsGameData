[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Looks like you had a rough time as well.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   Madam Ch'en, what happened here?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   We were ambushed by Reunion.
[name="Ch'en"]   We were caught in a withering assault with no reinforcements. They easily routed our forces.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   And Misha...?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   She was taken away by a woman dressed in red.
[name="Ch'en"]   I really should have...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  ...?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Nevermind.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   ...
[name="Amiya"]   Madam Ch'en, why is Misha so special?
[name="Amiya"]   If you keep hiding things from us, it's only going to be harder and harder for us to continue working together.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   I have no obligation to tell you.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   But Rhodes Island has an obligation to understand the objectives and prepare our strategies accordingly.
[name="Amiya"]   Naturally, we'll continue to follow the L.G.D.'s instructions during our operations...
[name="Amiya"]   However, when it comes to using the Infected to fight other Infected, we need all the information we can get.
[name="Amiya"]   While you may have that information, you don't have the means of using it effectively to reduce your losses.
[name="Amiya"]   On the other hand, we have the ability to stop Reunion, but we don't know what they're after.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ...
[name="Ch'en"]   You sounded a bit like that doctor just now.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   Is, is that so...
[name="Amiya"]   I think...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   This is something that is equally important to both of us.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   I see.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   If it's because you need to ask for permission from Chief Wei...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   When we investigated Misha, the most prominent bit of information was that her father was one of Chernobog's most influential people.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   Misha's father?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Naturally, we don't know how much Misha knows about Chernobog.
[name="Ch'en"]   She could know nothing, or she could know everything.
[name="Ch'en"]   Nobody knows...
[name="Ch'en"]   ...except her.
[name="Ch'en"]   We also have no idea what kind of information she might have.
[name="Ch'en"]   Since you predicted that Lungmen would be Reunion's next target...
[name="Ch'en"]   It's obvious that we have to prevent Reunion from using Chernobog.
[name="Ch'en"]   That's why we can't allow them to have Misha.
[name="Ch'en"]   We were aware of the fact that someone who fit her descriptions had taken refuge in Lungmen...
[name="Ch'en"]   But until you actually found her, we weren't able to verify if that intel was accurate.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   If that's the case, we can't waste any more time.
[name="Amiya"]   We have to stop Reunion and rescue Misha before they're able to take her back to Chernobog!
[name="Amiya"]   Rhodes Island, prepare to move out!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   It was the L.G.D.'s responsibility to track her down.
[name="Ch'en"]   ...and letting Reunion capture her was a dereliction of our duties.
[name="Ch'en"]   Rather than lauching a joint operation, we'll need Rhodes Island to eliminate other threats from Reunion.
[name="Ch'en"]   This is an order.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   ...Understood.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Don't let me down.

[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]

[name="Ch'en"]   They're not with this group of Infected. Curses...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]   Not with this group either... Damn it all...
[Character(name="char_015_lmg")]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]   They... retreated way too quickly...
[Character(name="char_015_lmg", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   It seems that Reunion also has its own hierarchy.
[name="Ch'en"]   They just left the riffraff behind to buy them more time.
[name="Ch'en"]   To think that a single person could delay our reinforcements...
[name="Ch'en"]   Just who are they...
[Character(name="char_015_lmg", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]   Madam! We found some Reunion stragglers over there!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]   Follow me!

[name="L.G.D. Agent"]   The nearby facilities can still be used, so please try not to cause too much damage!

[name="Ch'en"]   Shut up already!
