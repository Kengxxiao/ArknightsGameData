[name="Reunion Caster"]  Something's not right.
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  What is it this time? Is your illness acting up?
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  This is totally different from Chernobog.
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Even though our losses were significant, when we seized victory in Chernobog, we could see our enemies struggling and their accomplices fleeing for their lives.
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  But doesn't Lungmen feel like it's empty?
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  It can't be, right?
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Come to think of it, this is supposed to be Paci Plaza, right? How come such a large mall with so many shops is completely empty?
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Plus, I took a look around, and there's nothing of value lying around! Everything's already been taken!
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Didn't Patriot prohibit that...
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  That's not what I was saying. You know, Mephisto doesn't care what we do, but that's not the point.
[name="Reunion Caster"]  What I was going to say is that, it's like someone hid everything from us.
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  That's just your imagination. Lungmen can't do a thing against us!
[name="Reunion Member"]  We suddenly appear from every nook and cranny all of a sudden, and hot damn, it'll be just like that time at Chernobog.
[name="Reunion Member"]  This time, we're not going to wreak havoc across the city, but take it over. It'll become our city!
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Did you know?
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Know what?
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  Paci Plaza is the closest base to the L.G.D. Headquarters. It'll be quick and convenient to supply it from here.
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  I heard it when it was mentioned in the last briefing. Anything else?
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  All the Reunion forces around the city are to gather at the L.G.D. Headquarters, and then spread out to take over the entire city.
[name="Reunion Caster"]  We know how the squads in this district have been deployed...
[name="Reunion Caster"]  But what about the other districts? I know many squads are supposed to be making their way over here, but quite a few of them have gone missing without a trace.
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Missing... what do you mean by that?
[Character(name="char_1011_wizard_1",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Reunion Caster"]  It's really strange. Their comms were still connected, but there was no response from them. We don't have any way of contacting them.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Try to be careful though. These are our peoples' assets after all.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  They didn't move that piano away, probably because it's too heavy. That alone is worth 1.8 million LMD. The li'l Miss was boasting to me about it, so try to be careful.
