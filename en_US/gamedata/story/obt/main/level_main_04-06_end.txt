[name="Amiya"]   We've defeated Reunion's forces!
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Bah. For a bunch of roadblocks, these guys were a bit tough.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   ...
[name="Hoshiguma"]   There's no sign of Ch'en.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   We're in a real mess now...
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   She's not responding to my calls either! Tsk... This part of her hasn't ever changed.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   L.G.D.! All members, prepare to follow me--
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   No, Inspector Hoshiguma.
[name="Amiya"]   You should let us handle it.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   We're approaching the Originium-dense zones left by the Catastrophe...
[name="Amiya"]   If you go any further, the healthy risk being infected by Oripathy.
[name="Amiya"]   These consequences are too dire.
[name="Amiya"]   Furthermore, as Infected...

[name="Hoshiguma"]   Hahaha, I was just giving you a hard time.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   But you don't have to persuade me. I understand your concern.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   L.G.D.! We will be Rhodes Island's shield!
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Block the entrance, and don't let a single Reunion member enter or exit!
[name="Hoshiguma"]   We'll let the experts handle this problem!

[name="Amiya"]   Inspector...
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Oh, just call me Hoshiguma.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Go. Please take care of Ch'en.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Make sure you bring her back with you in one piece.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   I will, Hoshiguma...! I swear I'll bring Madam Ch'en back safely...!
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Make sure to stay safe yourselves.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Okay!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
