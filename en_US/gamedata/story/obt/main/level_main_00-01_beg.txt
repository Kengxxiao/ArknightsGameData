[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  No, look at how fierce this attack is. This must have been a planned operation.
[name="Dobermann"]  The place we rescued Doctor from was supposed to be top secret... but they somehow still managed to infiltrate it.
[name="Dobermann"]  It's possible that Reunion's attack has already spread through Chernobog in its entirety.
