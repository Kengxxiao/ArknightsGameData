[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...She uses heavy machinery to quickly and effectively destroy the enemy, while at the same time exhibiting astonishing self-control and adaptiveness. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Rosmontis is one of Rhodes Island's greatest annihilation specialists.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As such, the way she treats people and the way she speaks may worry you. The way she fights and its contrast with her appearance, is indeed very cruel.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Blaze running around with her chainsaw may be easier to accept, but the destruction of when Rosmontis takes the field is much harder to stomach.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If it will help you sleep at night, I can make you a promise. If it will help at all.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  —Rosmontis almost never kills. Though her tactics seems to singularly aim for that outcome, she actually focuses on disabling the enemy's combat abilities.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Take the last battle, for example, all the enemies were disarmed, and not a single one died to Rosmontis's attacks.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  She also has much more control over her weapons than she once did.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Of course, whether or not we can keep the prisoners alive depends entirely on our ability to destroy Reunion's leadership. Only then will we be able to send rescue teams into the core city.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But sometimes, we must use lethal force in order to accomplish our goals. Some loss of life is inevitable.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  —Rosmontis demonstrates these qualities because she became an elite operator.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Whether or not someone who has lost her sense of self can still be called a person is another topic I'm not interested in discussing. But humanity grapples with the extent and manifestation of this problem.

[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]  Answer my first question. The prophecy.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...'The last Wendigo will die at the hands of the Lord of Fiends?'
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]  Correct. I'm familiar with that guerilla group, and their leader. I'm certain it's him.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The original phrasing of the prophecy was 'The son of Hor-Tekrz, traitor to Sarkaz and disreputable end of the bloodline, will be executed by the Lord of Sarkaz.'
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Some prophecy. Whether or not there's any extension of their 'bloodline,' there are still many Wendigos living their lives in Columbia and Ursus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ...That is, if a few dozen can be called 'many.'
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And, considering the context of the time, you should view it as a threat. Many people did not want to see the Wendigos leave Kazdel.
[Character(name="char_171_bldsk_1",name2="char_003_kalts_1",focus=1)]
[name="Warfarin"]  It wasn't either of us who said it. And since you still remember it, you must have found it important. No?

[name="Warfarin"]  Hear me, Kal'tsit, the others may not say as much to you, but I will.
[name="Warfarin"]  He is one of the very few left among us. I am no bleeding heart, no goodly busybody, but... we are Sarkaz.
[name="Warfarin"]  I am a Vampire, and the old man is a Wendigo, but we are the same.
[name="Warfarin"]  This world is a tough place for Sarkaz. I hope he can return to Kazdel, if possible. Or come with us.
