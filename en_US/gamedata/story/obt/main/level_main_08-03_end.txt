[name="Alina"] Is that fire your doing!? You're the one who set them alight... guh! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#4")]
[name="Talulah"] Alina, I'm sorry. This will surely mean even worse to come for the village. But I just couldn't stand it.  
[name="Talulah"] I just couldn't stand this sort of...
[name="Talulah"] ...Alina?
[Character]
[Dialog]
Facing her, Talulah was taken aback. Alina met her gaze with an expression she'd never seen her wear before. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4")]
[name="Alina"] There's a fire in your eyes.
[name="Alina"] I knew from the moment you came to this village, you'd never be willing just to stay here.
[name="Alina"] You came from somewhere. Where you came from, you'll go back to. This village can't hold you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#4")]
[name="Talulah"] I won't go back. Don't look at me like that... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4")]
[name="Alina"] But within your eyes, truly, there's a fire.
[name="Alina"] You wanted to set something alight, burn it away, you thought none of this was how it should be, you bore it until you could bear it no more...
[name="Alina"] It shouldn't have been now, Talulah. Not now. 
[name="Alina"] The villagers are innocent. Your one flare of anger only served to hurt them.

[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4")]
[name="Alina"] Talulah, we need to go!
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#5")]
[name="Talulah"] No... those hideous patrolmen!
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4")]
[name="Alina"] We're Infected, but none of the villagers are!
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#4")]
[name="Talulah"] ...What did you say?
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4")]
[name="Alina"] I'm Infected too, Talulah. I'm Infected too.

[name="Alina"] He saved you, saved me, saved the whole village.
[name="Alina"] You threw... his whole plan into disarray.
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] What do you even mean? The villagers were the ones who— 
[name="Talulah"] ...Wait. You mean the one who turned him in... was... 
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=1)]
[name="Alina"] It was his idea. That way, the Patrol wouldn't come again, and hopefully, that would've been that. 
[name="Alina"] No matter how much strength you have, you can't resist the Patrol Unit.
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] I can.
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=1)]
[name="Alina"] And then? What if the Gendarmerie came? What if the city's garrisons and all the nobles' soldiers came?  
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] We just don't have the firepower. Once we've accumulated enough strength...
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#5",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] Because it's not right. It's not right! We can't just look on like this! 
[name="Talulah"] All these wicked things right before our eyes, but we turn away, just to save ourselves?! That's not right!
[name="Talulah"] ...That's selfish. Heartless, even.
[name="Talulah"] If righteousness can only be upheld by greater and greater violence, how can it even be considered righteous?
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#5",focus=1)]
[name="Alina"] I can't answer these questions of yours, Talulah. You've studied more than I have, that I know. 
[name="Alina"] But someone died today in the village. And no more ought to die. 
[name="Alina"] You're so clever. You can understand that.
[name="Alina"] Now, go, Talulah!
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] ...I'll be back.
[Character(name="avg_npc_079#4",name2="avg_npc_078#4",focus=1)]
[name="Alina"] Tell yourself that, Talulah. Tell yourself that.
