But why...
Why were his fellows hidden in the shadows behind the outlanders' swords?
His comrades fell, one by one.
In the end, he was the only one left. He was The Last Steam Knight.
He cannot fall here. The Steam Knights must not fall.
Victoria needs him. He must fulfill his duty.
No medicine, no matter. The armor will repair his flesh and blood.
No food, no matter. There are always critters crawling in the darkness.
No light, no matter. The sword gives him all the light he needs.
He is not dead. The Steam Knights are not dead. They continue to defend Victoria.
But...
What is Victoria?
I swore an oath before the King, before the people, before the world.
I stood vigil, night after night, but where lies the light of Victoria that I have sworn fealty to?
Is Victoria its king?
They hanged the king.
Is Victoria Parliament and the nobles?
No maintenance, no supplies, no new members. They sent the Steam Knights into mortal danger time after time, in order to feed their greed.
Is Victoria the people?
The people praise the Steam Knights, honor the Steam Knights, glorify the Steam Knights. They place all their hopes, all their dreams upon the Steam Knights. Nothing can carry hopes that are so contradictory, so complex.
What is Victoria?
Does Victoria only exist in the imagination?
There is still the sword, the Sighs of Kings.
It is the symbol of Victoria, beyond all doubt.
Then it will be his Victoria.
Now, someone wants to defile his Victoria.
This is unacceptable.
He cannot lose his last—

She was running.
The freshly-trimmed grass made her feet itch. Jim the Gardener laughed by the bushes. Ailshie ran after her, calling for her to slow down.
But she was eager to run towards the freshly-blooming flowers. They were golden, shining under the sun, like the emblem of House Cumberland.
Her father picked her up, sat her on his shoulder. She lifted her tiny palm, and let her touch the lines on the steam armor.
The broken armor stands up.
Her father is gone. She has grown up, and she no longer stands before the armor. She feels the heavy weight of the armor on her shoulder.
Through her visor, she sees a golden lion at the end of the path.

She sees before her eyes the red that filled the bookstore.
She does not even have the strength to vomit.

[name="Molly"]It's normal.
[name="Molly"]We're in a war, after all.
[name="Molly"]The Sarkaz have been arresting people left and right, often in violent ways. The children see them, and emulate their behavior.

[name="Golding"]Many remnants of Gaul harbor fear of the Steam Knights.
[name="Golding"]Those who were part of the war will never forget the sound of steam gushing outside their window that night.
[name="Golding"]But I had hoped that the Steam Knights would be more than just a weapon of death to the children.

[name="Golding"]I had hoped that there would be beautiful hope in their hearts when they play the Steam Knight.
[name="Golding"]I thought this was a war I could win.
[Character]
Golding's gaze follows the children.
The foam-made steam armor falls to the ground. She tries to pick it up, but pulls back sharply, as though she's been burned.

[name="Golding"]I thought I was teaching the children...
[name="Golding"]Now, I realize that they were the ones teaching me a lesson.

[name="Golding"]What we do may be utterly meaningless.
[name="Golding"]The lessons of the books are distant, blurred.
[name="Golding"]But no one can avoid being shaped by the times.
[name="Golding"]If they belong to blood, violence and war...
[name="Golding"]Then, our children will belong to blood, violence and war.
[name="Golding"]This is unavoidable.

[name="Golding"]What... what should I...
[name="Golding"]How could I dream of fighting it?
