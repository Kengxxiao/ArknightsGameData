[name="Nearl"]   ...You there.
[name="Nearl"]   The Reunion forces worked like a well-oiled machine when they took over the Chernobog military strongholds.
[name="Nearl"]   But your men act like deranged thugs.
[name="Nearl"]   Mindless slaughter, burning down the city, hunting down innocents... This was all for your own sadistic pleasure, was it not?
[name="Nearl"]   Someone base enough to plot these senseless crimes at a time like this... could not possibly have designed the plan to take down an entire city.
[name="Nearl"]   Your commander probably ordered you to cause chaos, but you succumbed to your perversion and tastelessness.

[name="Dobermann"]  If Nearl gets hit again, she won't be able to defend herself anymore!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7 ")]
[name="Amiya"]  Nearl, you need to retreat!
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_1#3")]
[name="Nearl"]   I can't... He's too powerful. I can't afford to let him hit our squads.
[name="Nearl"]   I have to intercept his attacks!
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#2")]
[name="Mephisto"]  She managed to block Faust's ballista... with only a shield--?!

[name="Amiya"]  Did we get him?
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]  I doubt it. The most we can hope for... is to put some pressure on him.
[name="Ace"]  Unfortunately, we don't have the time to dissect our enemies' tactics.
[Character(name="char_014_riope",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  He's very mobile and has high firepower. The longer this drags on, the less likely we'll be able to block his shots!
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_1#3")]
[name="Nearl"]  We can't give him time to set up...! Amiya, make your move while Team E3's Snipers keep him occupied!

[name="Amiya"]  Understood!
[name="Amiya"]  Team E1 Snipers, come with me and suppress Reunion's forces!
