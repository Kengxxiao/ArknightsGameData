Hui-chieh:
From where I left off.
I ran for a very long time. Ran into a small village.
I didn't think too much about it at the time. I only wanted to find somewhere to hide. I didn't think I'd actually find somewhere to stay.
And I think that old couple thought of me as a daughter. Since their own sons and daughters had probably long since lost their lives to Ursus's countless wars.
They even kept my secret for me.
I'm sure I could've spent a lifetime repaying their kindness.
I regret that I never did.

[name="Infected Patrol Unit"] During our previous routine inspection, one of our people was assaulted.
[name="Infected Patrol Unit"] Every household must now submit to a search, both for Infected and the attacker. Should we find them, we will execute them on the spot, and the household that harbored them will be punished accordingly. 
[name="Infected Patrol Unit"] If you don't want a hard labor sentence, turn them in. No one will come to harm if you do your civic duty, and the offenders and Infected will meet their proper end. 
[name="Infected Patrol Unit"] Now, we'll start from the first household.

[name="Talulah"] I know what's right. I'm not letting them punish these people. I'm not letting them murder anyone else.
