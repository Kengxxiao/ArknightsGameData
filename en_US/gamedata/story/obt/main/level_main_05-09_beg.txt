[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Madam Ch'en, something's wrong. Don't you think it's strange that we were able to enter the headquarters so easily?
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  There were so many Reunion forces outside so we braced ourselves for a hard fight, but it was as if they were sleepwalking.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  According to our scouts' intel, their equipment is practically damaged to the point of unusability. It's unlikely that they've seen much combat, and their degree of preparedness seems...
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  It creeps me out.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  I've noticed as well. They don't even know we're here. At least they're not a threat right now.
[name="Ch'en"]  We'll follow the plan. Next, our non-combat squads will scout out the distribution of Reunion forces on each floor, and attempt to restart the security system that was disabled earlier.
[name="Ch'en"]  Additionally, we'll need to be ready to hold off a possible Reunion encirclement. We must hold out until our plan is implemented smoothly.
[Character(name="char_015_lmg")]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Understood.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Focus your attention on controlling the situation inside.

[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  According to our sources, Reunion's temporary command center is on the rooftop.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  The rooftop? What kind of leader would put their command center on the roof?
[name="Ch'en"]  Hmm... there's a significant possibility of this being a trap.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  But we don't have a choice, do we, Madam?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  That's right. Taking back the rooftop would be like lighting Lungmen's signal beacon. We will let Reunion witness the moment when the L.G.D. Headquarters returns to our hands.
[name="Ch'en"]  We ought to lead them all here.
[name="Ch'en"]  Get ready, there are still a few hours to go. Let the recon and engineer squads go first. The combat squads still have some time to rest up before the main operation begins.
[name="Ch'en"]  Don't waste even the smallest opportunity to create an advantage. Expect our enemies to fight to the death.

[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Madam Ch'en, something doesn't feel right about this building.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  What do you mean?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Let me make a conjecture first. As we get closer to the top floor, we may encounter some resistance. Perhaps there are some enemies stationed on the roof.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  However, the lower floors were completely empty. Only on the sixth floor did enemies start to appear, and while their numbers have increased, they haven't posed any threat.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Just now, one of my squad members reported that he thought he saw some Reunion members walk down a corridor, but they disappeared in the blink of an eye.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Another member told me that he heard some whispering, but when he went to investigate, he didn't find anything.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  That's all we found from our investigation. But something feels wrong to me still.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  ...
[name="Ch'en"]  Let's go first. I don't have time for your nonsensical ghost stories.
[name="Ch'en"]  Even if there was something anomalous going on, I'll handle it after this is all over.
[Character(name="char_015_lmg")]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Yes ma'am!

[name="Ch'en"]  Let's take the fire escape route here. Though we don't it often, it's going to come in handy now.
[name="Ch'en"]  This staircase will take us straight to the rooftop.
[name="Ch'en"]  You'll all control the top floor and use your vision advantage to cover me. I'll head directly to the rooftop, and rejoin you after the situation is stabilized.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Madam Ch'en, are you really going alone? Whatever the situation is, I'm sure we'll be able to help.
[name="Ch'en"]  I have full confidence in your abilities. However, I might have to go all out in this coming battle.
[name="Ch'en"]  The most you can do to help me is to clear Reunion out of this entire building, and make sure I have nothing else to worry about.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  In that case, we won't get in your way, Madam Ch'en. Lungmen is counting on you.
[name="Ch'en"]  Wrong. Lungmen is counting on us.
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Yessir!
[name="Ch'en"]  Hurry!
