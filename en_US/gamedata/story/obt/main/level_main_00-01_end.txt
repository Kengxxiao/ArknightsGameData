[name="Amiya"]   Because I... am an Infected.
[name="Amiya"]   Dobermann and I, and most of the members of Rhodes Island, are as well.
[name="Amiya"]   Even those Reunion members who we just fought...
[name="Amiya"]   We've contracted a terrible illness. Something that terrifies most people...
[name="Amiya"]   'Oripathy.'
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]

[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Ursus has always treated the Infected harshly.
[name="Dobermann"]  I mean, who doesn't? Ursus just happens to be particularly cold-blooded about it.
[name="Dobermann"]  Civilians are taught to fear the Infected through propaganda. Nobody even bats an eyelid when the Infected are hunted down, and some even cheer for it.
[name="Dobermann"]  That's why Reunion chose this place...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]   However... this time, it's not just a simple protest anymore.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  They've begun to resort to large-scale violence.
[name="Dobermann"]  When Ursus puts an end to the rioting, the Infected in Chernobog will only face more cruelty.
[name="Dobermann"]  ...In contrast, with you here, Dr. {@nickname}, perhaps Rhodes Island's situation will improve.

[name="Dobermann"]  ...But with your memory loss, I doubt whether you'll be of any use again.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Ugh... Instructor, that's way too harsh!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  ...Perhaps you'll be able to master the theories again after some reviewing, just like how you relearned your commanding skills?
[name="Dobermann"]  After all, you are our field commander...
[name="Dobermann"]  To be honest, I never thought a neurology doctor could also be a master tactician...
[name="Dobermann"]  But after seeing you, I can somehow understand it.
[name="Dobermann"]  I mean, Rhodes Island itself is very similar to your field of study.

[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex",name2="char_002_amiya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   That's right. It is not enough to only conduct research, or only try to resolve conflicts.
[name="Amiya"]   We must address all of the problems surrounded the Infected.
[name="Amiya"]   This is the only way for Rhodes Island to give all the Infected a chance at survival...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  We understand them better than most others because we, like them, are also Infected.
[name="Dobermann"]  No matter who is involved or what is required, Rhodes Island seeks to put an end to the spread of hatred and disease.
[name="Dobermann"]  Dr. {@nickname}, perhaps this will be your calling as well.
