[name="Amiya"]Is he the informant you said could get us into Londinium?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_npc_394_1#1$1",focus=-1)]
[name="Jessica"]That's right.
[name="Jessica"]Mr. Thomas, who used to own a candy plant in Londinium's Sudean borough, and his uncle who lives in Columbia, are long-time partners of Blacksteel.
[name="Jessica"]His uncle put in a request to bring Mr. Thomas back to Columbia. The last time we talked, we told Mr. Thomas that we'd bring someone to pick him up if he found some way to leave Londinium.
[name="Jessica"]I just never expected...
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]...that Dublinn would hijack your aircraft. And by the way, they seem very interested in Mr. Thomas too.

[name="Jessica"]Hm, really?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="avg_npc_394_1#2$1",focus=-1)]
