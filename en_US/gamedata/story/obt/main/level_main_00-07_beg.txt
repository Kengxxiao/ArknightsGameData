[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   ...It's getting darker and darker.
[name="Amiya"]   It's as if the clouds are pressing into the skyline...
[name="Amiya"]   The air still feels clear, but the dark clouds aren't moving. It feels like all the stress is being compressed into a single point.
[name="Amiya"]   Even the wind has stopped...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  No doubt about it. A Catastrophe is about to befall this city.
[name="Dobermann"]  By the looks of things, Chernobog has been completely paralyzed by Reunion's attacks.
[name="Dobermann"]  But when it comes to disabling a mobile city, the preparations must have been made several weeks in advance.
[name="Dobermann"]  Could Reunion have taken some other action since then...?
[Character(name="char_014_riope",name2="char_013_riop",focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]   That's a bit unrealistic.
[name="Ace"]   Based upon what we've seen, Reunion currently doesn't show the kind of discipline required to stage a covert takeover.
[Character(name="char_014_riope",name2="char_013_riop",focus=2)]
[name="Guard"]   Most Reunion members are still wandering the streets, taking revenge on Chernobogians.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]   It's all just senseless fighting, killing, and arson.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  When the Catastrophe falls, even the impregnable Chernobog will be shattered...
[name="Dobermann"]  ...and turn into Originium-filled ruins.
[name="Dobermann"]  If fame or fortune is what they're after, Reunion is doomed to failure.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   Even with Ursus's chain of command in shambles, I still doubt that Reunion is able to face their military...
[name="Amiya"]   Why hasn't the Ursus military staged a counterattack yet?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  From my experience, when a riot breaks out, the military usually manages to quash it immediately.
[name="Dobermann"]  But we did just witness the Ursus guards getting overpowered...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   ...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1",name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  That masked Reunion leader might have been a cut above the rest... but there's no way she could single-handedly destroy the entire city.
[name="Dobermann"]  Unless...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Unless what?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  I've fought in many battles before...
[name="Dobermann"]  I've seen many people who acted in the same way as that Reunion leader.
[name="Dobermann"]  To them, soldiers are nothing more than pawns to be tossed away as soon as they've served their purpose.
[name="Dobermann"]  Soldiers could be used efficiently when needed, and then left to their own devices when not needed.
[name="Dobermann"]  Because the cost of training and maintenance is too high.
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   So, there's no standing army?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Right. Most of the time, they simply have to be fed with some hatred or fear...
[name="Dobermann"]  All that's needed to whip them into a frenzy... is a little push.
[name="Dobermann"]  If the way that Reunion leader acted was any indication for how the organization is run...
[Character(name="char_013_riop")]
[name="Guard"]   Ugh...
[name="Guard"]   Any Infected could join Reunion simply by donning a uniform and putting on a badge?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Correct..
[name="Dobermann"]  So... that explains their endless numbers.
[name="Dobermann"]  There are too many oppressed Infected, desperately trying to cry out. No matter how tenuous the solutions that Reunion offers them might be...
[name="Dobermann"]  As long as they see a light at the end of the tunnel, they will gladly lay their lives down to pursue it, even if it means jumping into a sea of hellfire.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]   Ugh...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Dobermann"]  They are not like us. Even if I don't fully trust you, I at least trust your abilities.
[Decision(options="......", values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]  And completely unlike you...
[name="Dobermann"]  That kind of leader is no commander.
[name="Dobermann"]  Those who would trample enemies and comrades alive... or rather, 'minions.'
[name="Dobermann"]  Perhaps not even minions. To Reunion, those thugs may have been nothing more than pawns.
[name="Dobermann"]  This is not a leader, but a tyrant.
[Character(name="char_014_riope" ,name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]   No matter who our enemies are, we will complete our mission.
[name="Ace"]   Someone once taught me and my teammates--
[name="Ace"]   'If facing a pawn, capture it; If facing a fortress, topple it; If facing the Crown, overthrow it.'
[PlayMusic(intro="$calamity_intro", key="$calamity_loop", volume=1, crossfade=1.5)]
[Character(name="char_014_riope" ,name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Ace, wait a minute.
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   Dr. {@nickname}, enemy light-armored troops are stationed in front of us.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]   Have we been found?
[Character(name="char_014_riope" )]
[name="Ace"]   Not yet.
[Character(name="char_014_riope" ,name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  However...
[Character(name="char_014_riope" ,name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]   We won't be able to avoid them. The route we're on is the shortest one; if we take a detour, we'll lose time we don't have.
[Character(name="char_014_riope" ,name2="char_130_doberm_ex",focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  No need for further discussion then. Thugs or pawns, all that matters is that we clear them out of our way!
