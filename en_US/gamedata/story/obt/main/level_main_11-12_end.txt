There is no mistaking that there is some kind of sound echoing throughout this space.
Is it a murmur she hears, having woken up from her dream, or is it a groan she owes to her fatigue?
They are staring at her.
<i>Victoria</i> is staring at her.
The moment she comes to realize this, a sense of agitation immediately follows.
What do they expect? What kind of future are they envisioning for her?
She grew tired of these days on the run long ago.
And it has been a very long time since she last heeded the call of that golden creature.

[Dialog]
[Character]
A meandering trail of blood can be found having slithering down the pathway and past the gap beneath the door. Or perhaps it crept its way out the large door.
The trail of blood has long since dried, leaving the shattered bricks on the ground covered in its twisted, dark crimson stains.
Likewise, there are tattered bolt heads, sword fragments, and craters left behind by Arts explosions, all submerged under the bed of dried blood.
There are also marks more massive in scale, such as the numerous scars on the door, each one by itself more than enough to tear the silence of this place asunder.
Although there are no bodies to be seen, everyone who seen war before can easily work out what transpired here.
Two groups, both prepared to fight to the death, battled each other. Evidently, they got their wish.
