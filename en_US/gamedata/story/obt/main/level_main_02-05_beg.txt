[name="Reunion Member"]   Who is it? !
[name="Reunion Member"]   What do you want?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]

[name="Amiya"]   Ahh... what a relief!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2", name2="char_102_texas_1", focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   I have an update here.
[name="Texas"]   I just took care of some guys who called themselves 'Reunion.'
[name="Texas"]   ... But there are a lot more of them coming.
[name="Texas"]   Reunion has come out of hiding and are starting to move in groups.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_102_texas_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   It's as I feared...
[name="Amiya"]   Reunion has already infiltrated Lungmen through the slums...
[name="Amiya"]   And their target... is the same as ours.
[name="Amiya"]   Otherwise, there would be no reason for them to come after Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]   Miss Misha is carrying secrets that only Lungmen and Reunion know.
[name="Liskarm"]   We're caught in a disadvantageous situation.

[name="Franka"]   Things aren't looking good for us right now.
[name="Franka"]   I'll really have to poke that officer's pretty little face later to find out what's actually going on.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   ...Anything else to add?
[name="Texas"]   If not, I'll lead the way. I know exactly where to go!
[name="Texas"]   Exusiai has confirmed our escape route. I'll now take you through it.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Franka, gather all the squads. We--
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]
[name="Franka"]   We... should find cover first.

[name="Amiya"]   They... have a leader!
