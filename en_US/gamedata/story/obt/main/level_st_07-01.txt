An old monster once told me... What doesn't kill you only makes you stronger.
I always thought it was stupid. But the guy's a monster, so maybe I do have to give this some thought.
Does a bug jump into a flame to get stronger? So stupid.
No. Let's not talk about how dumb and weak a bug is. You know, no matter how strong a bug gets, in the end, it's still just a bug.
If a bug jumps into a flame, all it proves is that the heat messed up its brain. Assuming it even had a brain, it obviously went mad.
But what if I was to leap into the flames? Besides proving that I'm crazy, what else would that prove? I'd come out a bit charred, but how would that make me any stronger?
But we're talking about death here. And what does an undying monster know about death?
Alas, such is the nature of the bitter death that none may resist.

[name="W"]  Hah. Oops, my bad. I've been a mercenary for too long, forgot all about that reporting-every-detail-of-my-life-to-the-boss thing. Sorry, Leader.
[name="W"]  But you know I can't go all the way up to the top of the command tower, so I have to ask you to stoop to my level.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#5", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  Your sarcasm isn't doing us any good, W. Reunion needs the might of the Sarkaz, and we should strive not to add any more personal conflicts between us.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Just call us devils. Only the bleeding hearts and self-righteous call us Sarkaz. Us mercenaries? We know exactly what we are.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  Strange. Devils, the 'inferior race of the banished.' You mercenaries cannot accept this definition, nor will you take pride in it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]
[name="W"]  Duh. But your people started calling us 'devils,' not as a hate thing, or because it was catchy or whatever.
[name="W"]  Devil is a 'fear' thing. You people called us that because we scare you.
[name="W"]  So us mercs like being called 'devils,' because we know exactly what it really means.
[name="W"]  And we always make good and sure anyone left alive takes the subtext straight to heart.
[name="W"]  Oh, sorry— Me yapping on about this is like trying to show off in front of an expert, isn't it?
[name="W"]  We're a no-name merc squad famous for brutality. But compared to you? Why, that's like a worm trying to go up against a crab.
[name="W"]  After all, Leader, nobody scares people better than you.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"]  'Inflict terror upon your enemies, and provide warmth for your friends.'
[name="Talulah"]  To strike fear into our enemies and bring hope to our comrades. That is the way Reunion has always done things. 
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  So, driving Ursus's core city into Lungmen is also in line with a certain comrade's ardent wish?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  Our warriors are still bravely fighting inside Lungmen. They need our assistance, and we will bring it to them.
[name="Talulah"]  The Infected inside Lungmen require hope, and our warriors here have expressed their earnest desire to be that source of hope.
[name="Talulah"]  Everyone's wishes find harmony here, and the responsibility to see those wishes come to fruition belongs to us, Reunion.
[name="Talulah"]  —This will also bring benefits to the Sarkaz. I assure you, beyond doubt.
[name="Talulah"]  What your kind seeks is not hope, so I will provide you with profit.
[name="Talulah"]  Sarkaz mercenaries like you, scattered between various city states, as well as those who pull your strings. You will drink deeply of the chaos between cities and countries, and it will nourish you.
[name="Talulah"]  After Lungmen, no nomadic city is safe. Your kind will find more room to expand and thrive, and your people will prosper.

[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2")]

[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  That is not your fault. The kinship between Misha and Skullshatterer was bound to lead to uncertainties.

[name="W"]  Why'd you send me to grab that scientist's daughter then?
[name="W"]  It seems like you didn't even need her or her secrets for your big plan. Between the attack on Lungmen and firing up the core city, what was the point of her anyway?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  The authenticity of the key still has to be verified.
[name="Talulah"]  I can personally verify that we've activated the core city, but Reunion still needs full control over the way it stops. That's where this key comes in.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Mephisto told me the one the old geezer found in the abandoned city was the real deal.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  No, W. Mephisto would not tell you that. It would only be you spilling secrets to Mephisto while thinking about extracting the information you want from him.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  I have my own channels, and might be a little more frank than I used to be. Oh, but I guess I could've mixed up my sources? Something like that.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"]  W, if you want me to be more transparent, I can explain to you the details of my plan. All of them.
[name="Talulah"]  Skullshatterer and your first operation tested the L.G.D.'s response speed. It allowed us to adjust our strategy and improve upon our plans to take down Lungmen.
[name="Talulah"]  Without your cooperation, we could not succeed.
[name="Talulah"]  The Key did truly exist, but was lost upon Misha's death. The Key that Patriot sought was only a backup plan to deal with this situation.
[name="Talulah"]  I won't force you to tell me where your information came from, but my explanation should convince you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_046#5")]
[name="W"]  All right, all right. But, Leader, I want to know how many Keys there are. Won't ask any more questions after that, yeah?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"]  Two. Sergei, Royal Chernobog scientist, held one of them, and delivered it to Misha using special means.
[name="Talulah"]  The other was held by Count Boris, former mayor of Chernobog. During our attack, he broke off a city plate to flee. However, he was unable to escape the Catastrophe.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  The ruined satellite city.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  Our undercover agents in the city have kept everything there that we need. We can lure the L.G.D. into an ambush given the proper distance.
[name="Talulah"]  We have sufficient reason to capture the abandoned city, and the best use of it is to occupy it and turn it into a stronghold.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  You're really good at explaining things, Leader. I'm all out of questions.
[name="W"]  Hey, I'm not asking too many, am I? Sorry to make you waste so much time explaining it all to me.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#2", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  W, if openness can resolve the misunderstanding between us, I won't be stingy with my time.
[name="Talulah"]  In order to ensure a relationship of long-term mutual benefit, I will continue to draw up our future plans. Hopefully this can slightly increase the trust between us. 
[name="Talulah"]  We will need to support each other to have a chance at overcoming the troubles to come.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_046#5", focus=2)]

I never liked this woman.
The Talulah they talk so nice about in private is so insanely boring. And this Talulah talking to me right now is just another lying bastard.
Oh, not to say there's anything wrong with lying.
I lie a lot. Nothing stronger than a well-placed lie, except maybe a bomb. The truth is like a cup of water. What good does it do when the whole house is on fire?
But when I lie, I know I'm lying. I chew up my thoughts up and spit them into ears. This she-dragon, though, she lies so natural it's like the words come out of someone else's mouth.
Doesn't matter who she's talking to. It's not just tweaking a couple points to cover up her plans.
—She takes on a totally differently form, turning into something they trust more, telling them what they want to hear.
Reunion's most beloved figure is, of course, the Leader, Talulah. Standing here with me, she's a businesswoman, a trader. With Patriot she turns right into a warrior woman.
She'll show her true face one day, but not everyone will live long enough to see it.
Besides, does she even... have a true face?

A wave of heat rushes towards me. Luckily, the comforting warmth isn't hers.
I'm no Arts expert, in my experience, ninety-nine percent of Arts are no match for this pure burst of energy.
Explosions. Heat, shrapnel, shockwaves. It's an equalizing force that tears apart any enemy, or me.

I press the button on the device in my hand. A simple Originium detonator switch, remotely operated, chained explosions.
A blazing light of destruction mixing with a deliriously pungent aroma. Waves of heat carrying fragments of debris, overturning everything in front of me. Just as I planned, everything reduced to cinders, even the most thick-skinned Sarkaz...
Wait...
Wait, wait... Didn't I have a detonator mechanism for the explosives?
......
Why did she plant her sword in the ground?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]

[Dialog]
[Character]
No fire. No burning.
The hundreds of Originium explosives I painstakingly twisted into the steel foundations of the city... are all gone.
Where are the explosions? The heat? The shrapnel?
Nothing.
The place where I planted the Originium is deformed, melted, and warped. Drips of iron and the burned oil paint covering it gives off nasty smell. But that's it.
My shrapnel. My blast waves. My light show. It's not going to happen.
The cataclysm that I pictured in my mind a million times over... isn't going to happen.
The cunning dragon lady must have poured her Arts into her sword and channeled it deep into the steel beneath us.
The heat radiated to each of my traps, melting them away.
You figured it out. You're so smart, W.
The world-ending explosion from all directions that should have blown her into a billion little pieces... is nothing but a big, wet fart.
All right, I've been thoroughly played.

[name="Patriot"]  Leader.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  Sir. Your return gives me great peace of mind.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]  Formalities, unnecessary. There was a battle here. Just now.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  It was between me and W, who tried to assassinate me. Don't worry, I'm fine.
[name="Talulah"]  From the reports I've received, she was already showing signs of rebellion when she occupied Chernobog.
[name="Talulah"]  She made her own decision to let the enemy escape, instigated the Sarkaz mercenaries' rebellion, and murdered her superior.
[name="Talulah"]  These series of actions were likely caused by outside political forces.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]  Where is she now?
[name="Patriot"]  She should have, stood trial.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  She detonated the explosives hidden around her body and fell into the core area.
[name="Talulah"]  I will dispatch someone to search for her body. Sir, you need not worry yourself.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]  That, does not concern me.
[name="Patriot"]  And her Sarkaz? What of them?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  I will deal with it. Now that the core city is steadily moving on track, I'll need to stabilize the situation immediately.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]  ...Leader. This core city... was activated. Without my knowing. Why?
[name="Patriot"]  Even the comms. Have been broken.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=1)]
[name="Talulah"]  We're out of options. Ursus may attack Chernobog at any time and slaughter our compatriots. For their sake, we must first take down Lungmen.
[name="Talulah"]  Right now, all energy must be used to support the operation of the core city, and we have no excess power to support tuning the ingoing and outgoing channels.
[name="Talulah"]  The Originium left behind by the Catastrophe is so potent that we cannot endure it.
[name="Talulah"]  The order to recall you exhausted the last of our backup supply. Now, there is only one place that can provide us with enough refined Originium.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=2)]
[name="Patriot"]  Even then, if time is tight. Please discuss with us.

[name="Patriot"]  But... What's done, is done.
[name="Patriot"]  This Key. How will you use it?

[name="Talulah"]  It can stop the city.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1", name2="avg_npc_025_1", focus=2)]

[name="Patriot"]  Many things, once started. Will not stop.

[name="Talulah"]  So, I'm entrusting this key to you. You'll decide when we stop.

[name="Patriot"]  Any evil, no matter how great. Will always come, to an end.
