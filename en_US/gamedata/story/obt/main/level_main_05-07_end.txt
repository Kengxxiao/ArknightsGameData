[name="Ch'en"]  Medics, former South Paci Plaza, exit 12. One injured, a senior L.G.D. inspector. Get here quickly.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Has the bleeding stopped?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You should know me by now. The wound has closed, but I won't be able to lift my shield for a while.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  How are our colleages doing?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  We were the only ones who fell. I consider that a small win.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You're really not bringing me with you? Reunion's commander may well be hiding inside the L.G.D. Headquarters. It's going to be a brutal fight.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I'm aware. But considering your condition, it's for the best. Wouldn't you agree?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Hearing you say that stings a bit, but it's fine. I know better.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Remember, be careful out there.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I know.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  No matter how you look at it, Reunion is weaker than we expected. Despite that, they still managed to take Chernobog.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Also, you have a weak point. I can't stress this enough, but never let your thoughts consume you. Ever.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Don't be so obsessed with something that you neglect the other possibilities. There is nothing out there worth going off to battle for, except for your continued existence.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I'll treat this as your advice to me. I'll take it to heart.
[name="Ch'en"]  Hurry up and get better. I'll be waiting for your return after this mission is finished.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I'll protect the medic team. You should get going.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Sure.

[name="Radio Operator"]  Reunion has already passed the Causeway Bell.
[name="Radio Operator"]  Report from AU7: Reunion is also assembling in Ha Wan. I repeat, Reunion is currently assembling. This is AU7's mission briefing.
[name="Radio Operator"]  Squad AO3 has eliminated the Reunion forces in Front Bay as planned. They are now pushing the remnants back towards the L.G.D. Headquarters.
[name="Radio Operator"]  All enemies in front of Scorpio Palace have been annihilated. Now retreating towards Charles Avenue to head to the rally point. This is Squad AL1's report, over.
[name="Radio Operator"]  ...
[name="Radio Operator"]  These are the updates on Reunion's movements and each squad's progress.
[name="Radio Operator"]  Over.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Understood.
[name="Ch'en"]  Continue the operation. Our objective is to drive all Reunion forces into the designated area.
[name="Ch'en"]  If small groups of stragglers are seen in other districts, you are authorized to eliminate them.
[name="Ch'en"]  Try to draw them out if possible. Focus on avoiding casualties. We'll need to preserve our strength.

[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  What did you call me?!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Ah Ch'en. You're done for! You're so dead for what happened at Paci Plaza. I heard it myself - you were the one who gave those orders!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Is that all you wanted to say?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Look, why did you reject Rhodes Island's help? Was it because you felt guilty?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I don't recall you being a psychologist.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Don't worry, I'll help you make reparations.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Reparations?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Hehe, I can't tell you yet.
[name="Swire"]  But, you're so done for because of what you did!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  By the way, do you still remember that one restaurant in Sheung Wan?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Huh? Which one? Well, whichever one it is, they're all closed now!
[name="Swire"]  Wait... are you trying to change the subject?!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  The one with that absolutely divine steak sandwich.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Huh? Oh... OHH! I just remembered! The restaurant with a steak burger as big as your palms put side by side!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  That's the one.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  I used to go there quite often while on my patrols... Get down! Who said you could stand up?!
[name="???"]  Aaah!!
[name="Swire"]  What was that place called again? Goodie Foodie?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Sounds about right.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Aha, now I get it. You're going to treat me to a meal, aren't you? But why don't we go to some place a bit more high-class?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Your idea of 'high-class' is very different from mine.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Come on, I can foot the bill.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Miss S, do you really think I'm that kind of person?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Do you want to try calling me that again?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Sorry, I bit my tongue.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  You clearly did that on purpose!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Swire, I was just thinking... If we don't do a better job this time, we won't be able to face the locals.
[name="Ch'en"]  Our businesses depend on Lungmen, and Lungmen also depends on them.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  If you feel that way, you should stop running your mouth. The sooner we take down Reunion, the sooner you can treat me to brunch.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Seems like the fighting is pretty intense on your end as well?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Ah, it's fine. I can handle it.
[name="???"]  Quick! They're about to get away!
[name="Swire"]  How annoying! Hey, hurry it up! We don't have all day!
[name="Swire"]  Ah Ch'en! I want a steak, tomato, and egg burger!
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  No problem.
[name="Ch'en"]  Sorry for accidentally locking you up in the vault that other time.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  You call that an accident? ! I know you did that on purpose! Whatever, it felt cathartic splashing water all over you this morning, so I guess we're even.
[name="Swire"]  Hey, Ah Ch'en.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Hmm?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Safety first. Don't throw your life away for the sake of what's immediately in front of you. Remember that there are lots of people who are counting on you.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Hmph, is that so. Thanks for your advice.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Now that you're in front of the restaurant, that means you're almost at the L.G.D. Headquarters, right?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_010_chen_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  That's right.

[name="Ch'en"]  Good work.
[name="Ch'en"]  All of you assembled here are the cream of the crop. As we speak, many of our colleagues are still out there fighting. But we have our own mission.
[name="Ch'en"]  The building in front of us used to be the symbol of Lungmen's safety — the embodiment of law and order, the heart of the L.G.D.
[name="Ch'en"]  But now, it has fallen into Reunion's hands, and has been tainted by conspiracy and warfare.
