[name="Kal'tsit"]  The second, was when he stood up against Ursus and walked away from his life as a warrior of the Ursus Empire.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And just now... I'd say he made his final betrayal. He betrayed Reunion and the Infected he served, and stopped being a warrior of the Reunion Movement.

[name="Amiya"]  Ursus is his motherland. He fought for Ursus all his life... and blamed himself for the death of his son.
[name="Amiya"]  He believed that Ursus was evil, but for the sake of this land, he gave his life... fighting until the very end. He also paid the price for his second betrayal.
[name="Amiya"]  This time... he had to stand up against Talulah. But he foresaw that some of the people he strove to protect would die because of his actions.
[name="Amiya"]  Even though the decision he made preserved a future for the Infected, he... only felt pain... for the deceased.
[name="Amiya"]  This is his third act of betrayal, and the reason he was so determined to atone for it. From beginning to end, this battle was to make up for the consequences of his betrayal.
[name="Amiya"]  Through these three times, fate ended up pushing him further and further when he just wanted to turn back. He hated the cruelty and mockery of fate. He never wanted to follow it, but he bore the consequences for it all the same.
[name="Amiya"]  Ten years, twenty years... I'd be able to understand. But... too much time had passed. After facing all those regrets for so many years, too much time had passed.

It's hard to imagine.Even the old Patriot can die.
Should I laugh? Should I shed a couple tears?
What's really funny is now that he's dead, you climbed all the way to the top of Reunion, second only to the Leader.
Ah, you've really outdone yourself. You should give yourself a pat on the back, W.
*clap* *clap*
Why do we cry? Because even he is dead. Ahh, alas, poor Patriot!
What thoughts went through his head as he died, and what was it like? Did he die on his feet or on his knees? If even he can die, then who among us can live?
Maybe he was the most likely to die.
Never knew how to keep a low profile. Only knew how to cling to a vague ideal. On this path he walked and walked, until everyone around him was gone. And then, he could finally rest in peace.
How sad.
Wait, doesn't that sound a bit like you, W?
Ehh? How am I anything like that?
W, don't lie to yourself. You're practically the same.
Nah, I never lie to myself. I'll never become like Patriot, because I can't.
I just can't.
Besides, death was... kind of a release for him, right?
