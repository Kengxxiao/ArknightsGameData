[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  I must look exactly like a Reunion member... huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_057")]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  So you know each other.
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Right, so everything this Cautus said was a lie.
[name="Ursus Infected"]  You and Reunion have always been on the same side! Isn't that right?!

[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...Tati... Did you find any food? The people in the shelter don't have long.
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  What more do you want from me?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Let's get you to someplace safe first.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  Stay away from her, Guard! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  I'm staying back.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...I know things might be hard to explain.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  But we have to be careful. All the Ursus here became Infected of no fault of their own... and they've had a tough time.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Most of them are already on the verge of mental breakdown... All it takes is someone to push them over the edge.
[Character(name="avg_npc_057")]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  We've had it 'tough?' You're psycho murderers! Sadistic freaks!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Because of you... look what happened to me! Look what I've become!
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  But if you don't leave right now, the devils will find you. You'll be handed over to Reunion.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Patriot's troops have completely pulled out of this area. If you're caught, I can't save you at that point.
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Then just let me die! I'd rather die than watch you monsters run rampant!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  What about guerrillas or this so called 'Aegis of the Infected?' ...Are they any different from the rest of Reunion?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  They are. Without them, we'd be dead already.
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Tell me then! Right now!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  If they're just trying to do the right thing, why are they still with Reunion? Why'd they do this to our homes?!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Why aren't they rebelling? Why aren't they walking out?! Why did they do all this even knowing we've been spat on, persecuted, and killed?
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Why didn't your great guerrillas fight back against the patrolling devils? Why?!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  I watched them... they used their own hands... to rip... tear...
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ......
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Patriot can't be everywhere at once.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  When Patriot has to command his forces to defend the sanctity of life, something has gone horribly wrong.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  But... as long as the guerrillas still continue to pass through this area, I can assure you that the truly wicked in Reunion will not set foot here.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  That is the difference between Reunion's thugs and Patriot's guerrilla warriors. Patriot, and the Sarkaz as a whole, are much more disciplined than Reunion's ranks.
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Where are they then?! Why aren't they here?
[name="Ursus Infected"]  When they left, the other Infected were so much worse, so cruel!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  How is that not their fault? If not for the guerrillas, they never would've turned against us like this, right?! They're just out for revenge on the guerrillas!!
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...You're wrong.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  The guerrillas did the right thing. And while as you said, some may be trying to take revenge on the guerrillas...
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  They gave you a chance to survive, so Reunion is retaliating against them. That is all.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  No, they did more than that... One might even say they're defending your dignity. I saw it with my own eyes.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  I saw the soldier telling the others to call you by your names, rather than your numbers.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Isn't that right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_059",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  And, the reason they left us alone was so that we could help you when they are away.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...Chernobog has already been cut up into many pieces.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  There are some places that the guerrillas are stationed, but also many where they are not... If no one can maintain discipline, then if you want to survive... you can only depend on us.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  And that's even assuming we survive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Amiya, do you believe what I said just now?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_057")]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  No!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Cautus girl, look... Look! He's Reunion!
[name="Ursus Infected"]  How can you believe anything coming from Reunion? And what about me? Am I supposed to buy into their bullshit now that I'm Infected?
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Look, the people you said wanted to murder us... aren't they Reunion?
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Now that I'm Infected, is Reunion suddenly going to take me in and treat me better? How the hell am I supposed to know who's who, and which one of you is going to kill me?
[name="Ursus Infected"]  You, Reunion, all of you should just... should just...!

[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_059")]
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  ...Forget that for now! The Sarkaz mercenary patrol is going to pass through this warehouse soon!
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  If we don't deal with them, or at least hide, they're going to find us and take us away...
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Not to mention the regular Reunion patrols. We don't have much time to find supplies!
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  That's why so many are starving, and short on medicine. There's a lot of death among the people of Chernobog.
[name="Rhodes Island Guard?"]  Amiya, Dr. Kal'tsit! Also... Dr. {@nickname}, I really hope you can trust me. Or at least find somewhere to hide!

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]
[name="Ursus Infected"]  Y-your accent... you're from the capital of the Empire, aren't you?

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You're educated.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1",name2="avg_npc_057",focus=2)]

[name="Ursus Infected"]  It's all gone now, thanks to you Infected.
