[name="Talulah"] You're that Cautus from Rhodes Island.
[name="Talulah"] Where's Buldrokkas'tee? Did you test your mettle against his halberd, or did you just see his mangled corpse?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] ......
[name="Amiya"] You... How could you talk about him like that?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"] Oh? I'm asking with the utmost respect. I'm merely asking for the truth.
[name="Talulah"] He never took off his helmet, did he?
[name="Talulah"] His helmet hides the exposed greyish-white skull of the Wendigo. If the people were to see his true appearance, they would surely be frightened out of their wits.
[name="Talulah"] Yet, their hate and zeal would drive them onwards, and the force of the crowd would have broken through the guerillas' defensive line. 
[name="Talulah"] Buldrokkas'tee would not have allowed the Shieldguards to attack a single civilian... They are not spies, after all.
[name="Talulah"] Buldrokkas'tee would have been torn to pieces by the raging mob. He would have allowed himself to fall to their rage and ignorance, just as he knew that this day would arrive, as he decided to give up and surrender to his humanity.
[name="Talulah"] Since you've appeared here, that can mean only one thing. Buldrokkas'tee is dead.
[name="Talulah"] Tell me, how did he choose to die? He was a noble warrior. I would like to know how he met his end.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] I... I killed him.
[name="Amiya"] ...It was me.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"] You?
[name="Talulah"] What sort of firepower did you have at your disposal? That was... Buldrokkas'tee.
[name="Talulah"] Even so, you've appeared here all by yourself, just like my pitiful sister.
[name="Talulah"] Alright. The last person in this city who could kill me is now dead. Now I have nothing left to worry about.
[name="Talulah"] Should I congratulate you, slaughterer of my kin?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2")]
[name="Ch'en"] Amiya, don't fall for her tricks!

[name="Amiya"] I know, Madam Ch'en. She wants to kill you.
[name="Amiya"] The Talulah standing before us still holds some untainted strands of memory deep within her heart. You are the only remaining link to her past.

[name="Amiya"] Talulah will only truly die when she kills you with her own two hands.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] You've stopped making any sense.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Madam Ch'en, the Talulah in front of you has not completely died yet. This tyrant is still not yet in full control of her mind.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"] Tell me more, Cautus. Tell me about that outdated chicanery of yours, absurd as it may be.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] You should have died when Talulah stabbed you. You should be gone.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah"] Mind-reading rabbit... I've never considered this. Even if you can read minds, you should not know these things. Where did you hear of them?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Am I reading your mind?
[name="Amiya"] You've always bragged about being able to protect yourself completely using your psychic Originium Arts, Duke of Kashchey. It was your pride, as your political opponents remained helpless against it.

[name="Talulah"] ......
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] All I see are memories. I have no idea what you are thinking about right now, but I can feel your emotions.

[name="Amiya"] You are not Talulah.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] I suggest you look out for your own skin before jumping to conclusions.

[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Your actions speak louder than words, false Infected warrior.
[name="Talulah?"] Black Arts that absorb memories but do not differentiate between consciousness. Not a unilateral extraction, but rather proliferation and acquisition that goes both ways...

[name="Talulah?"] ——Devil——Sarkaz——

[name="Talulah?"] Did you personally take care of Buldrokkas'tee, or did someone do it for you?
[name="Talulah?"] You cannot do it, young, false Lord of Fiends. You cannot take control of them and their royal court. You are not a real Lord of Fiends. You're not even a Sarkaz. You're just a little Cautus.
[name="Talulah?"] You don't have the power to fight against your enemies. Should try, you would be swiftly eradicated.
[name="Talulah?"] Alternatively, you are just the newest toy of the Sarkaz rulers. Do you feel sadness at being a test subject, immature Cautus?

[name="Talulah?"] If you can feel my 'dread', that can only mean that your Arts are still too shallow.

[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] You've never believed anything I said, Hui-chieh. You've never trusted me.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] You asked if I knew Talulah, I do. You asked if I believe Talulah, of course I do.
[name="Ch'en"] That's why I came here of my own free will, to verify this thought of mine.
[name="Ch'en"] But, I did not come here to prove your innocence... No, definitely not.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Why? Didn't you just say that you trust me, Hui-chieh?
[name="Talulah?"] Right now, we are both Infected. Why can't we just stand together? Isn't our reunion supposed to be something happy?

[name="Ch'en"] The L.G.D. Officer Ch'en and the present Ch'en Hui-chieh... I'm not trying to prove that 'you are innocent.' No, how could I?
[name="Ch'en"] The Talulah of the past? Excuse me?
[name="Ch'en"] No matter what caused you to become like this, since when can we look at Talulah as two distinct halves?
[name="Ch'en"] It's because I knew you in the past that I want to understand even more... Who and what turned you into this!
[name="Ch'en"] The pain and suffering you've experienced, the truth behind your father's death, your hate towards Wei Yenwu. I can understand all that. Maybe they all pushed you down this road.
[name="Ch'en"] But what was it that caused you to become someone so cruel?
[name="Ch'en"] What was it that turned you into the vanguard of the Ursus invasion? Did you deceive your people too, Talulah?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] You're judging me? You abandoned everything to come here, just to tell me off?
[name="Talulah?"] Was it Wei Yenwu who turned you into such a blind, cold-blooded person? Shouldn't you be asking the reasons behind my actions?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] No. That can wait for later. I can reconstruct the flow of events from the garbage heap.
[name="Ch'en"] I came to fulfill my duty.
[name="Ch'en"] If you really weren't responsible for these, I would fire a flare. It wouldn't matter even if you killed me, I'd still be able to prove that you didn't deserve death.
[name="Ch'en"] But if you're conspiring to do harm, then we will gladly give up our lives just to stop you.
[name="Ch'en"] I want to see to what extent you're wrong. Taking a life without a trial? That's murder. And the city is guilty of murdering the Infected.
[name="Ch'en"] Right now, I see it all clearly.
[name="Ch'en"] My sword, my thoughts, my ideas, they're all on you.
[name="Ch'en"] As for the past, let it remain in the past. The past...
[name="Ch'en"] Will never return.
[name="Ch'en"] I will never forgive a schemer who toys with lives, no matter who they are.
[name="Ch'en"] You cannot break the law with impunity.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Heh heh...
[name="Talulah?"] You wish to cut your ties with me, Hui-chieh.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] Hmph...
[name="Ch'en"] It's pointless to try and taunt me. Feel free to guilt me or whatever.
[name="Ch'en"] This is who I am. A woman of my word. You're the one who's forgotten all this.
[name="Ch'en"] Amiya, I won't ask what else you need to prepare. Instead, what do you want me to do?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Ah, Madam Ch'en... I need a bit more time.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] How long?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Three minutes at most.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] Then I'll give you at least three minutes.
[name="Ch'en"] This time, we're really fighting 'shoulder to shoulder', Amiya. It's just the two of us.
[name="Ch'en"] But we're carrying the burden of countless lives. You know as well as I.
[name="Ch'en"] Three minutes, Amiya. In the next three minutes, you will not die. I guarantee it.
[name="Ch'en"] So, once we're done with this, I really hope you'll give me a proper explanation.
[name="Ch'en"] You have to help me to understand exactly what my sister's become...
[name="Ch'en"] Also, I want to know if we'll be able to face this thing's true nature in the end, instead of just an empty shell with a theatrical streak!
[name="Ch'en"] I'll accept the outcome, no matter what it is!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Alright, I promise, Madam Ch'en. And, thank you... thank you for your perseverance.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] I'll believe it when I see it.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"] Talulah, your actions, your words... I've been watching!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] I'm relying on you, Madam Ch'en!

[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Cautus, I don't know how you manipulated my sister's thoughts, or what sort of dirty deals you have with the Sarkaz.
[name="Talulah?"] Is the shadow controlling you and the mastermind behind W the same person?
[name="Talulah?"] Don't bother answering. I need my flames to teach you a lesson... You should not have attached yourself to the Sarkaz. You should not have used their power to disgrace the relationship between my sister and me.
[name="Talulah?"] Dirty deeds and sinful pasts are acceptable. The generosity and benevolence of one's country would still be willing to accept you and your repentance.
[name="Talulah?"] Yet, to go along with the Sarkaz and fall in with Kazdel?
[name="Talulah?"] ... Both you and the one who raised you should be exiled forevermore, to roam aimlessly in the wastelands, thirsty without any hope of water, hungry without a dream of food, to be eaten alive by maggots as you struggle to live, yet unable to find peace as you die.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] ......
[name="Ch'en"] ... Are you really Talulah?! 
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Hui-chieh, if you want to know the truth, stop protecting that seed of evil by your side. She is tearing us apart, twisting the truth and using my memories to mislead you...
[name="Talulah?"] Cautus, you! Buldrokkas'tee left in search of the light, yet you walk towards darkness... You're not worthy of killing him!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] ......
[name="Amiya"] If the devils you're talking about are the Sarkaz I know, and if the people you're talking about are like you...
[name="Amiya"] If the light you're talking about is slaughter, spreading pain, harm and deception, whereas the darkness you refer to is to salvation, sympathy, and the fight for justice...
[name="Amiya"] Then I am willing to continue onwards together with the Sarkaz!
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Has your identity as an Infected blinded you? Did you misunderstand their goals because of how the Sarkaz use the Infected? Are you not aware that you are the pawn in their hands?
[name="Talulah?"] You're trying to drag my sister into the abyss for this?
[name="Talulah?"] My flames will burn through your deceit and reveal the truth hidden behind you. Take care, for this will hurt. However, I have no choice but to do it.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] You should ask my permission first.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] I don't wish to do this, Hui-chieh.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] Haven't you already done this before? I've had enough of your... hypocrisy.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"] Your hate is blinding you, preventing you from seeing yourself and escaping your upbringing...
[name="Amiya"] You're the one who hasn't left that fire still, 'Talulah'!
