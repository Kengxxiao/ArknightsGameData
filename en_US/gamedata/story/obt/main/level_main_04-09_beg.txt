[name="Mephisto"]   Don't think I didn't see your reinforcements coming.
[name="Mephisto"]   Well, whatever. I have something to show you. I'm sure you'll like it.
[name="Mephisto"]   Looking back now... We were originally planning to take over Chernobog from the very beginning...
[name="Mephisto"]   We waited for so, so long... and finally our time has come...
[name="Mephisto"]   The moment when we take our revenge against Ursus! Against those who persecuted us Infected!
[name="Mephisto"]   But, what about the fellows in this sub-city?

[name="Mephisto"]   They ran away.
[name="Mephisto"]   They had pretty quick reactions. Ran away before we had a chance to take action.
[name="Mephisto"]   Disconnected themselves, and took off as quickly as they could--
[name="Mephisto"]   But where did they hope to escape to?

[name="Mephisto"]   Our comrades had long permeated every district, waiting for our opportunity.
[name="Mephisto"]   In the end, we caught up to them, and gave them the punishment they deserved.
[name="Mephisto"]   These cowards, these perpetrators; what were we to do with them?
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#5")]
[name="Mephisto"]   It's simple - we would make an example of them!
[name="Mephisto"]   A proclamation that all injustices against the Infected would be purged...
[name="Mephisto"]   ...Yes, that is the symbol of the Reunion Movement...
[name="Mephisto"]   Let them all turn into effigies of terror, one by one!
[name="Mephisto"]   You, set that nearby effigy on fire! Let there be light!

[name="Reunion Member"]   Yessir!

[name="Mephisto"]   Make an example out of these ten percent...
