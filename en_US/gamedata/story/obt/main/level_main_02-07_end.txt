[name="Infected"]   Thank you... Thank you so much...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   It's not safe here. You should hurry and leave.

[name="Infected"]   Leave...?
[name="Infected"]   Where... would we go?
[name="Infected"]   This was a place we could call home... But it's all ruined now...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]   I'm sorry...
[Character(fadetime=0)]

[name="Infected"]   It's not your fault...
[name="Infected"]   It's not...

[name="Exusiai"]   I didn't expect Reunion, the self-proclaimed savior of the Infected, to attack other Infected.
[name="Exusiai"]   Now that... is what I call bad publicity.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1", name2="char_103_angel_1", focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   This Reunion infiltration did not just occur spontaneously.
[name="Texas"]   I'm sure there were many Infected here who chose to follow Reunion.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1", name2="char_103_angel_1", focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Ugh... They'd rather trust Reunion over Rhodes Island--
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_103_angel_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]   Rhodes Island does not give empty promises.
[name="Franka"]   There are many Infected who are willing to accept whatever Reunion offers, even if it's nothing more than an illusion.
[name="Franka"]   There are few who can see through the illusion.
[name="Franka"]   And among those who can, most are willing to give up everything just for that vague glimmer of hope.
[name="Franka"]   Who would choose to believe our little bunny, who is too kind to deceive others?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]   ...
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#5")]
[name="Misha"]   I believe her.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]
[name="Amiya"]   Misha...?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1")]
[name="Misha"]   Nnh...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   Be careful! You can't move around yet!
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=2)]
[name="Misha"]   I'm just a bit dizzy... Don't worry.
[name="Misha"]   Is Reunion... still chasing us?
[name="Misha"]   I don't know what they want from me...
[name="Misha"]   But...
[name="Misha"]   Let's go...
[name="Misha"]   Amiya.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   ...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]   I understand.
[name="Amiya"]   Let's leave right away.
[name="Amiya"]   Shortly, we'll be able to exit the slums and meet up with the L.G.D.
[name="Amiya"]   Thank you, Misha.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#3", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=2)]
[name="Misha"]   No...
[name="Misha"]   I... should be thanking you.
