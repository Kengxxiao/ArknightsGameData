[name="Amiya"]   The Catastrophe...
[name="Amiya"]   The streets are now buried underneath rubble, and collapsed buildings are blocking all the roads...
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]   Is the Originium already beginning to metastasize...?
[name="Dobermann"]   We're almost there, but everything is blocking our way!

[name="Dobermann"]   From the plaza, the streets, the buildings... and even all the ruins.
[name="Dobermann"]   Look at those numbers. Hah...
[name="Dobermann"]   That explains why they weren't afraid of the Catastrophe at all, except for the ones who ended up being crushed.
[name="Dobermann"]   Even if we assume...
[name="Dobermann"]   That the Catastrophe wiped out half their men--
[name="Dobermann"]   They still have enough people here to kill us a dozen times over.

[name="Nearl"]   We have to fight. After we break through their line, we'll slip out in the ensuing chaos.

[name="Nearl"]   Even if they outnumber us ten-to-one, if they're just a bunch of thugs, we still have a chance!
[name="Nearl"]   Stay calm! Prepare for battle! Defensive formations!
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]   ...Tsk.
[name="Dobermann"]   With these numbers, if they wanted to take over Chernobog... they might actually be able to do it.
[Character(name="char_148_nearl_1#3")]
[name="Nearl"]   There are too many...
[name="Nearl"]   Way too many of them..
[name="Nearl"]   Where did Reunion find all these Infected?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]   We're completely surrounded...
[name="Dobermann"]   I never asked for this kind of respect from Reunion.
