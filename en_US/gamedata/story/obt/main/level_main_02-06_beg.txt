[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  Could they have come from the nearby buildings...
[name="Amiya"]  They seem to be wearing some rudimentary jetpack, but it's enough to get the job done.
[name="Amiya"]  We'd be at a disadvantage if they managed to sneak through places we aren't able to defend...
