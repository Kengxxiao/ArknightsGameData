[name="Amiya"]You... practice medicine?
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#11$1", name2="avg_npc_394_1#5$1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]Only some basic nursing techniques.
[name="Heidi"]This job inevitably brings me into emergency situations. To give me and my friends a better shot at survival, I had to at least learn to use a first-aid kit.
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#11$1", name2="avg_npc_394_1#21$1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]You're really amazing.

[name="Heidi"]All we're doing is protecting our home. But Kal'tsit... and you, Amiya, you all carry so much more responsibility on your shoulders.

[name="Amiya"]...We've lost a lot of people on this operation.
[name="Amiya"]I... I feel the pain of the Self-Salvation Corps' soldiers. They've never had to deal with such horrific enemies before.

[name="Amiya"]Yes...

[name="Amiya"]Clovisia said she was afraid Rhodes Island would get the Self-Salvation Corps involved in a war they weren't a part of.
[name="Amiya"]If working with us puts them at greater risk...
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#12$1", name2="avg_npc_394_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]During last night's operation, what would've happened if Rhodes Island had not been there?
[name="Heidi"]Without W colluding, had she not stopped the mercenary leader... and without Rhodes Island's operators keeping Manfred at bay, we wouldn't even be having this conversation right now.
[name="Heidi"]The calculus of exchanging one set of lives for another simply does not exist for Rhodes Island—
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_394_1#2$1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]But even if Kal'tsit were here, I'm sure she would say every opportunity comes with its risks.

[name="Amiya"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_400_1#8$1", name2="avg_npc_394_1#7$1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]I understand.
[name="Amiya"]That's why we have to be better prepared.
[name="Amiya"]Miss Heidi, I need more information from within the city. Not counting the Sanguinarch, how many kings do the Sarkaz have inside Londinium?
