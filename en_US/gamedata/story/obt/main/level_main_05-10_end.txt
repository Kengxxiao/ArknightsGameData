[name="Blaze"]  I was expecting you to say something like 'I didn't need Rhodes Island's help anyway,' or 'I'd rather die than work with them.'
[name="Blaze"]  But at least you don't seem to be that stubborn. Is there anything else you'd like to say? If not, I'd like to head back to Rhodes Island.

[name="Swire"]  I bailed Rhodes Island out, and also finished arrangements for the various brigades. Coordinating and managing everything took me three full nights.
