Hui-chieh:
The snow hasn't melted. And spring hasn't come.
It feels like this next spring is never going to arrive.
Each time I lift my head up to see the candlelight, I just cannot help but to reach my hand out to put it out, only to light it up anew in the darkness.
Please go away soon, winter. If you don't go away soon, we'll be buried by all this snow.
Please, I beg of you.

[name="Talulah"]  What?
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"]  You've been pretty gloomy the past couple months. Did something happen? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"]  I haven't spent that much time with everyone here, but going by what I've heard from the others, I got the impression you used to be a bit more... energetic?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"]  Hey, watch it, buddy. Talulah's not often down in the crowd like this. Why don't you try repeating what you just said to the captain and see if he appreciates it?   
[Character(name="avg_npc_058",name2="avg_npc_080",focus=2)]
[name="Infected"]  Yeah, can't say I have the balls.
[Character(name="avg_npc_078")]
[name="Talulah"]  Patriot isn't as scary as it sounds. The Shieldguards are all like this. Don't let it get to you. 
[name="Talulah"]  He just hasn't been talking much because of his throat problems lately... and his silence can be intimidating.
[name="Talulah"]  As for how I'm doing... Don't worry.
[name="Talulah"]  Yeah... I just have a lot going on in my mind. Our team is getting closer and closer to the Ursus cities. and there's a lot we need to thrash out. I probably gave you that impression because I've been really trying to rack my brain. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"]  Yeah, you're right. We're running low on provisions, and we don't have enough manpower. If this goes on, we aren't going to last much longer.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"]  That's right, and that's why we need to pay extra attention to what all the outside forces are up to.
[name="Talulah"]  First of all, we need to make contact with the local Infected groups and diaspora as soon as we can.
[name="Talulah"]  And aside from that, there are bound to be people trying to track us down... If we take even one wrong step and fall into their trap, all of us will have end up in a snowy grave.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"]  That doesn't sound good.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"]  Of course it doesn't, but as long as we plan our route carefully, we won't find ourselves in that situation. 
[name="Talulah"]  ...So that's why, the most important task we have at hand is to minimize our losses.
[name="Talulah"]  Breaking up our teams might conceal our movement better, but then communications will become a problem.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=1)]
[name="Infected"]  Oh, right, we can't use those comms we took from the Ursus. We don't have their transmitters.
[Character(name="avg_npc_080",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"]  This will put our liaisons and recon units in unnecessary danger.
[name="Talulah"]  It's a drain on resources to train someone to use the guerrillas' code words. If we want distribute whole sets of comms to everyone, we'll need to get our hands on the prototype somehow...
