[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  *Pant* *pant*... Impressive!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  The black raincoats are retreating! Run while you can!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Thanks!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  Don't thank us. If you have the strength, you should fight alongside us!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="avg_npc_037",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Did you see him swing down from the fourth floor and graze my head like that? If I didn't freeze his weapon with the Originium FrostNova left in my backpack, I wouldn't be standing here!
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Very impressive. They're just like the swordsmen in the gas masks back in Ursus. Even stronger, really!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="avg_npc_037",focus=2)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  You almost died, what are you so excited about? The masked swordsmen you're talking about were the Ursus Royal Guard! We only met five of them that time!
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  Did you count how many raincoats there are?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="avg_npc_037",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  Does that mean we're even more awesome than before?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="avg_npc_037",focus=2)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  This is not a time for jokes. Their techniques and their equipment mean they must have a city... Even the craftsmen of multiple cities supplying them.
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  There's no way we can beat them back on our own. Don't even think about trying to kill them!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="avg_npc_037",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member A"]  I just... I just think I did pretty well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="avg_npc_037",focus=2)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  The point is this situation is way beyond what we can handle... We can't hold out for long!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_016")]

[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Mephisto has taken some... hits to his psyche.
[name="FrostNova"]  Him? Traumatized?
[name="FrostNova"]  Wait, where is Faust?
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Faust stayed behind to give us, and others, a chance to escape. We left him outside the slums.
[name="FrostNova"]  ......
[name="FrostNova"]  It's hard to come back from that.
[name="FrostNova"]  Faust was a brave warrior.

[Character(name="char_1505_frstar_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=1)]
[name="FrostNova"]  You could. We must get our remaining people out safely.
[name="FrostNova"]  Find a sniping position and await orders. We will need your support in the coming battle. We don't know when the enemy may attack again.
[Character(name="char_1505_frstar_1",name2="avg_npc_016",focus=2)]
[name="Phantom Crossbowman"]  Understood!
[Character(name="char_1505_frstar_1#9")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  I don't think so. The Ursus were willing to use direct artillery fire on the upper city!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  I knew they were brutal. But that brutal?
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  We saw it with our own eyes.
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  The raincoat people are very different.
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  They see civilians as targets, since they can't tell the difference between Infected and uninfected. They don't know if maybe we're dressing up as civilians.
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  The Ursus just didn't care, but these people don't let a single one slip through.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  There are so many fleeing, it's damn near impossible to keep order! FrostNova is in a tough spot!
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  Sister won't let anyone die. Reunion or no.
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  We came to Lungmen to fight. How did we end up saving people? It's funny.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  The fighting is pretty much done. If you guys didn't show up, we'd all be dead!

[name="Reunion Member"]  Can you not talk like that...? I used to think you guys were so imposing, but now you just seem like a bunch of clowns.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Yeti Squad Member"]  You got us all wrong. We just don't talk much. Shouldn't be imposing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037",name2="char_1002_nsabr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]  Anyway, aren't we supposed to be holding this place with you?
