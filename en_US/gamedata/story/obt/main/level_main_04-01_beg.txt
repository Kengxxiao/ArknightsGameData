[name="Kal'tsit"]   ...
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I already heard what happened from the recon squad.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Amiya, let me check your hands.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   There's no need for that, Dr. Kal'tsit...

[name="Kal'tsit"]   It looks fine. The rings haven't cracked or discolored.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   But it might be different next time.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Listen closely, Amiya...
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Be a little more careful.

[name="Amiya"]   Dr. Kal'tsit, I...
[name="Amiya"]   ...I need some rest.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Go ahead.

[name="Kal'tsit"]   You are also responsible for what happened.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   When you first came back to Rhodes Island, she looked a bit like this.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   These emotions never really left Amiya.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   This has to change.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   ...Dr. {@nickname}, you should stay with her.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Don't mess up.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2")]
[name="Amiya"]   I thought I did a good job hiding it.
[name="Amiya"]   Yes, I'm a bit worried... just a little, though.
[name="Amiya"]   I'm already used to doing this.
[name="Amiya"]   After all, I can't drag down everyone else any more.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Good morning, Dr. {@nickname}.
[name="Amiya"]   Oh, Dr. Kal'tsit, you're here as well?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Amiya.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I have a rather urgent mission here, and need some people to help out.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   An abandoned city was discovered not far from Lungmen.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I surmise that it's one of the cities that formed in the aftermath of the Chernobog incident.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   We'll have to explore that city, uncover more information, and search for any survivors.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   If the situation is particularly serious, for example, if Reunion is hiding there, then there may be serious ramifications on our future operations.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Here's the specific proposal that I have in mind. Look over it when you have time.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Understood.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Oh, one more thing.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Franka submitted a report to me mentioning that they had to return to Blacksteel.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   As for the situation in the Lungmen slums, Penguin Logistics requested for you to meet them there to discuss some information.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   There are some more sensitive details, so it'd be best for you to go in person.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   I know. I'll head over right now.
[name="Amiya"]   Doctor, let's go--
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I still have some things to discuss with Dr. {@nickname}.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   ...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   May I listen in?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   You may not.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   I can cover my ears...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   You cannot. You should get going.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Aww...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   Dr. Kal'tsit, you're not allowed to bully Dr. {@nickname}.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_002_amiya_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   I won't.

[name="Kal'tsit"]   You couldn't even do something so basic.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Forget it, I had a feeling this would happen.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Amiya is an incredibly resilient kid.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   But, if she has to force herself to be strong, there will come a day when the pressure breaks her.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Do not let this happen.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   If there is a next time, you'd better be a little more useful.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   --?
[name="Kal'tsit"]   What's with that face?

[name="Kal'tsit"]   If Amiya is involved in an intense battle...
[name="Kal'tsit"]   ...You must check her rings immediately afterwards.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   No matter what changes you see, you must report them to me.
[Blocker(fadetime=1.2, block=true)]
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   For the time being, that's all you're allowed to know.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Oh, right. You have to go down to the medical center in two days to have a physical done. Don't forget it.
