[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If the operators stand on the sand and wait for the city to pass over them, both height and speed are going to be an issue.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  No one will speak of you. No one wants to upset Ursus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Our neutrality gives us some freedom to move in the cracks between forces, and that means we can't be backed by any power.
