[name="???"]    You have no reason to object, right? Just a few insects that flew too close to the light... are they really worth your time?
[name="???"]    My troops have already received your info. You've already done your part.
[name="???"]    All that's left for you to do is to go home. After all, you're just responsible for the core energy sector and its surroundings...
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#6",name2="char_1502_crowns#1",focus=2)]
[name="Crownslayer"]    Don't do anything unnecessary...!

[name="Dobermann"]    What is Reunion trying to accomplish?
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#1")]
[name="Mephisto"]    Oh, nothing in particular. To be honest, I wouldn't even mind letting you bunch go. You weren't even our targets in the first place.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]    If we weren't your targets, then why...
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#1")]
[name="Mephisto"]    However, I had the honor of watching your battles.
[name="Mephisto"]    Your combat tactics as well as your personnel configuration were quite intriguing.
[Character(name="char_016_medic")]
[name="Medic"]    ...Intriguing?
[name="Medic"]    You think that the carnage of battle is... intriguing?
[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#1")]
[name="Mephisto"]    Rhodes Island... I've read up on your group before.
[name="Mephisto"]    At first, I thought you were just another ordinary company.
[name="Mephisto"]    But by the looks of things, don't you think your ambitions have stretched a bit too far from playing with test tubes?
[name="Mephisto"]    It'd be terribly dull if I allowed you to just walk out of here, wouldn't it?
[name="Mephisto"]    What I'd like is to have a little competition, a ritual of sorts.
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]    ...We don't have time to waste on a preoperational kid.
[name="Dobermann"]    (Amiya, get ready. We might have to break through with force.)

[name="Mephisto"]    Actually, I'll let you leave my hunting grounds safely as long as you win.
[name="Mephisto"]    Until then, my friends here will keep trying to kill you.

[Character(name="char_1507_Mephisto_1#1")]
[name="Mephisto"]    Crownslayer is so fixated on what you're going to do next, where you're going to go.
[name="Mephisto"]    But I'm different. What I care about is...
[name="Mephisto"]    What exactly are you? Where are you from?
[name="Mephisto"]    Yes, you. The one staring at me right now... You are somewhat different from us.
[name="Mephisto"]    What was the device in that facility that was able to preserve your life?
[name="Mephisto"]    I am so, very curious.
[name="Mephisto"]    See, I'm not such a cold-blooded person...
[name="Mephisto"]    So how about it, my esteemed Rhodes Island guests, how about giving this person to me as a gift?
[name="Mephisto"]    It would be a shame to end the game early, but at least I'll let the rest of you go. How about it?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]    Doctor...
[name="Amiya"]    Get behind me!!
