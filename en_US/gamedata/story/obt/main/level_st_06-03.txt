[name="GreyThroat"]  You're Infected?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  If we died in that battle back there, what's the difference between regular you and Infected me? It's just a couple dead people.
[name="Blaze"]  Some people care whether they are Elders or Ancients, some care about the country they come from, some look at race, and others value wealth....
[name="Blaze"]  I'm Infected, but I've never given anyone the 'oh woe is me,' 'Infected people are so oppressed' crap. Nobody wants to hear it.
[name="Blaze"]  Pick out anybody here in the slums, Infected or uninfected, nobody wants to hear it.
[name="Blaze"]  The level of pain doesn't matter, I just wish we could look at the pain of the Infected.
[name="Blaze"]  'Infected people are people too,' it's as simple as that. And I don't want people looking at me like a pitiful little animal, I'm out for an even look, on the level.
[name="Blaze"]  Massacres, segregation, imprisonment, hard labor, I've seen it all, but what can I do to see the end of them?
[name="Blaze"]  The white rabbit did what I never could.
[name="Blaze"]  She showed me a true death struggle.... The kind of terror she would show us even if there was only a fraction of a second left. That kind of fortitude is enough to transcend any identity.
[name="Blaze"]  If I were to go and fight Lungmen's soulless black raincoats right now, it'd be a walk in the park. Compared to the white rabbit, they're nothing.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  No. I told you already. I'm dying, GreyThroat.
[name="Blaze"]  But fighting to the death for what you believe in? That's a solid ending. Bottom of my bucket list.
[name="Blaze"]  ...Get a load of these two.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  Who?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Dr.{@nickname}  and Amiya.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  Where's the Doctor going?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Off to Rhodes Island to bury the white rabbit.
[name="Blaze"]  Well, it says burial, but it's really just disposing of the body to prevent her from crystallizing, dusting, and causing secondary infections. We Infected people deal with that all the time..
[name="Blaze"]  At least, as a Rhodes Island operator, I've come to trust the Doctor. GreyThroat, did you see the look in Dr.{@nickname}'s eyes?
[name="Blaze"]  It's those eyes, that's what makes me trust somebody like that.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  I saw it.
[name="GreyThroat"]  ...I think it's still Amiya's eyes that are scarier though.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Because those two are headed in different directions.
[name="Blaze"]  Dr.{@nickname} is going to the Infected crematorium, and Amiya is off to Lungmen, to the new graveyard for the Infected.
[name="Blaze"]  I finally understand why Ace says Dr.{@nickname} is worth just as much as Amiya and Kal'tsit
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  So where is Kal'tsit?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Kal'tsit's wherever she's supposed to be.
[name="Blaze"]  Okay, let's go. Since you're not going to leave Rhodes Island, I'm gonna ask you one more time: please help me up.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  Why don't you wait for the medics to get here?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Because I'm in real bad shape. Elite operators... gotta look tougher than this.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1#3",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  ...You'd rather die than look uncool for a minute.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1#3",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Why do you say things you know will hurt me...?
[name="Blaze"]  And do you know who's our support medic on this op? It's Gavial. That Gavial. She said she'd wash her hands and be right over!
[name="Blaze"]  How do you feel about getting my blood splashed in your face?
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  Give me your hand.
[name="GreyThroat"]  I don't like blood.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)] 
[name="Blaze"]  Then I suggest we walk a little faster...
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)] 
[name="GreyThroat"]  Right.
[name="GreyThroat"]  If I hadn't saved those Infected children, you wouldn't have saved me, and I wouldn't have had a chance to change my mind about Infected people..
[name="GreyThroat"]  That's another way the Infected have inspired me.
[Character(name="char_017_homura_3#5",name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  Even a business has its own development plan.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Are you implying that Lungmen owes something to the Infected side of your business?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  No. Rhodes Island has never had an 'Infected' side.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  Rhodes Island isn't just fighting for the Infected.
[name="Amiya"]  I'm not just an Infected person.... I'm also a part of the global community.
[name="Amiya"]  Rhodes Island has such expertise in dealing with the Infected because many of our operators are themselves Infected and know the experiences and circumstances of the people.
[name="Amiya"]  But trying to rid the land of the specter of Oripathy never meant that we were fighting only for the Infected.
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Wei, if you think we are just a simple and naïve Infected rights organization with an armed detachment.... I would be very disappointed. A grave misunderstanding.
[name="Amiya"]  Rhodes Island fights for all the people of this world. You, us, and them.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ........
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  Lungmen doesn't need our help. With the termination of this contract Rhodes Island will also leave Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  Rhodes Island has done its due diligence. It's all there in black and white. When we terminate the agreement, all the auxiliary clauses lose effect along with it.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Rhodes Island could take Lungmen's gracious bounty as a gift.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  No need, Mr. Wei. We in Rhodes Island are more interested in the way our partners do business than their 'bounty'.
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Wei, you have treated us as a pawn in your game from the beginning. Now that the pawn has proven its worth, our exit should be in accordance with your plans.
[name="Amiya"]  However, Mr. Wei...
[name="Amiya"]  ........
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Go on.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  If it was only Rhodes Island that was being played, I would not terminate this contract. As strange as it may sound, I can understand mutual distrust between partners.
[name="Amiya"]  It's just that we're not the only ones that Lungmen is hiding the truth from.
[name="Amiya"]  The L. G. D., the people of Lungmen, the Infected in the slums.... None of them know the shady methods hidden behind the curtain.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I've heard you can read minds, Miss Amiya.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  You may assume that I can't, or that I can.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Can I take your speculation as a warning, rather than an interrogation?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  I'm not going to dictate Lungmen's strategy or future plans, Mr. Wei. But I have the power to prevent my operators from participating in them.
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Wei, whether a Rhodes Island operator, a member of the Reunion Movement, an exile for Chernobog, or a citizen of Lungmen...
[name="Amiya"]  They are all living, breathing people. I don't think it's acceptable for their lives to be guided by secret machinations.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I, on the other hand, believe that playing a role is far more important than whether or not one recognizes that role.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  ...No. You're wrong.
[name="Amiya"]  Some things are... for Mr. Wei, perhaps too commonplace. Just like for the average person, quarantining an Infected person is an ordinary thing, not worth discussing.
[name="Amiya"]  But, no matter how 'normal' it is, it should not be treated as a 'normal' thing.
[name="Amiya"]  Simply because something has happened to us enough times, we become accustomed to it, and that makes it acceptable...? That doesn't make sense.
[name="Amiya"]  Otherwise, even if we eradicate Oripathy, our conflicts will not diminish or die down.
[name="Amiya"]  They will simply be reappropriated to imprison and torment another group of people... Just no longer the so-called 'Infected'.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Is this a request... Or simply an ideal?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  This is my standard.
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Wei, there is one more thing I must say.
[name="Amiya"]  ——The living are not pawns. People are people.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Do you play chess, Miss Amiya?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1",focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  Mr. Wei...
[name="Amiya"]  Do you play black, or white?

[name="Ch'en"]  No, it could only be you.... It can only be you.
[name="Ch'en"]  The rat and her cunning father are at best a little ruse. Only you would dare to order this.
[name="Ch'en"]  I had thought that by defeating Reunion, by reuniting all the people of Lungmen, we would eventually get through this. We could even bridge the misunderstandings between Lungmenites....
[name="Ch'en"]  I never imagined... but I should have.
[name="Ch'en"]  Once again you reassert yourself as the master of Lungmen. As you always were.
[name="Ch'en"]  But still.... How...? How could you do such a thing?
[name="Ch'en"]  You tear down every obstacle? You burn everything in your path? To what do you finally bow your head?

[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Lord Wei, who controls everything in Lungmen, suddenly realizes that the secret he's been hiding for years has long since ceased to be a secret?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Officer Ch'en, know your place. Guards!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  It was Talulah who told me.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ........
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Of course, everything Talulah knew, not many people knew in the first place.
[name="Ch'en"]  You're angry, because you know this could threaten your rule.... That old man, that Duke of Kashchey, has been in your nightmares from the very beginning.
[name="Ch'en"]  And you've never felt even a little bit sorry for Talulah, have you?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Officer Ch'en, don't speculate on facts you are not authorized to know, and don't trust information from unknown sources.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  You're tired.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I certainly don't trust that old duke! He almost destroyed all of Lungmen, and he's the one who kidnapped Talulah!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  So...
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  But I remember it well.... It was a sunny day. That night, there was no moon, only a few stars.
[name="Ch'en"]  The old man grabs Talulah and stands on the other side of a broken bridge.
[name="Ch'en"]  And behind you....
[name="Ch'en"]  Behind you stands a crowd of people in black raincoats.

[name="Ch'en"]  You would sacrifice anything to get what you want!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Ch'en Hui-chieh!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2")]
[name="Ch'en"]  You want to clean up the slums, even destroy them! So many Lungmenites, so many Lungmenites who trusted us, so many Lungmenites who stood behind us all along...
[name="Ch'en"]  Is it because the Infected don't count as citizens of Lungmen? Because they can't afford to live in your high-rises? Or is it because the people in the slums will one day live in peace with the Infected?
[name="Ch'en"]  Are you really protecting Lungmen? Aren't you the one who is a threat to this city and her people?
[name="Ch'en"]  Don't think you can throw a couple rats in front of you and get away with this!
[name="Ch'en"]  The Lins wouldn't dare to do this without your permission!
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_010_chen_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Miss Ch'en.
