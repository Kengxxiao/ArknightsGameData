[name="'Molly'"]How could you reminiscence about the past, young as you are?
[name="'The Mysterious Spectator'"]Who can keep the sun from setting? Such desires are the greatest greed.
[name="'The Mysterious Spectator'"]I have seen countless acts of madness performed in the name of preserving this glory. They turn to banditry, or fight amongst themselves, ultimately accelerating the decay of this country.

'Molly' turns around onstage, takes a few steps, then turns back, hiding her face in the shadows.
But her counterpart speaks first. His expression is calm, like water undisturbed. He shifts his hands, then crosses them.

[name="'The Mysterious Spectator'"]They will not admit that those who fall try to cling to the sunlight, but grasp only lightning.
[name="'Molly'"]Must they accept their fall?
[name="'The Mysterious Spectator'"]They can choose to not look back at the peak.
[name="'The Mysterious Spectator'"]If they would turn their gaze around, they would realize that it is no abyss lying before them, but fertile earth in which infinite possibilities lie.
[name="'Molly'"]You say the abyss can be conquered? You do not know the truth of the abyss, nor do you understand that time is short.
[name="'The Mysterious Spectator'"]The abyss lies before us. We can fill it with flesh, and burn the remnants with blood, leaving behind wide open fields for those who come after.
