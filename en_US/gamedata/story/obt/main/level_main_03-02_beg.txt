[name="Ch'en"]   It's about time you showed up, Hoshiguma.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Apologies. We were delayed for a long time.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Any injuries?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   No.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   However, we were shocked by how strong that Infected was.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   The Special Ops Division had already committed a lot of members to reinforcing Lungmen's defense.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   I had to take the rest of the available members with me.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ...Was your entire squad really held up by a single enemy?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   I didn't believe it either until I saw her with my own eyes.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   That person... truly was that strong.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   On top of that, she seemed a bit... absent-minded?
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Anyway, about these people standing next to you...
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Are they Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]
[name="Amiya"]   Madam Ch'en, is she...
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Hoshiguma, an elite from the Special Operations Division.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   So you're the Rhodes Island that I've been hearing so much about?
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Hmm, such a young kid. Are you also with Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"]   She's their leader.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]
[name="Amiya"]   Um, Madam Ch'en...
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Woah...
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Anyway, let's cut the small talk.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Any ideas about what we do now?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Two of our special agents have located the kidnappers' location.
[name="Amiya"]   They're tracking Reunion as we speak, and can provide us with directions.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Not bad.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Ch'en, I can see why they've earned your praise.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   These people take their work seriously.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]
[name="Amiya"]   Madam Ch'en... praised us?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Hmph.
[name="Ch'en"]   Hoshiguma, gather all our squads. It's time to move out.
[name="Ch'en"]   Lead the way, Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Understood. As expected, Reunion left behind some scattered forces.
[name="Amiya"]   They'll be lying in ambush on our route...
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Not a problem.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]   Yes, as long as we move cautiously, we'll be able to take the initiative against them.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   All right!
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Let me see how well you fight, Rhodes Island!
