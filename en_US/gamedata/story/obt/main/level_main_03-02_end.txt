[name="Reunion Member"]   So, you must be Misha?

[name="Misha"]   ...?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]   I've heard a lot about you from Skullshatterer. Now, I finally get to meet you.
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=1)]
[name="Misha"]   Are you also... Infected...?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]   Yes, I am.
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=1)]
[name="Misha"]   Why did you... join Reunion?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#2", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]   Why?
[name="Reunion Member"]   ...
[name="Reunion Member"]   My wife, my child... they were all killed by the Chernobogians.
[name="Reunion Member"]   Under Ursus, the Infected were treated worse than lifestock.
[name="Reunion Member"]   The destruction of Chernobog...? No, no. That is far too light of a punishment...
[name="Reunion Member"]   Do you know how much blood is on their hands?!
[name="Reunion Member"]   Misha... We've been feared, exploited, humiliated, and persecuted...
[name="Reunion Member"]   ...Just because of the fact that we're Infected.
[name="Reunion Member"]   Not for any other reason.

[Character(name="char_1500_skulsr", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=2)]
[name="Reunion Member"]   Coming.
[Character(name="char_1500_skulsr", name2="char_1002_nsabr_2", focus=1)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   We're only using this abandoned mine as a temporary base until we can reorganize and regroup.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Once the time is right, we'll make our way back to Chernobog.

[name="Skullshatterer"]   I threw away that name long ago.
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=1)]
[name="Misha"]   Why...?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=2)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   That person already died.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Just call me Skullshatterer.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Are you... afraid?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=1)]
[name="Misha"]   Skull...shatterer? ...Why?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=2)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Ah... You'll soon understand.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   After we learned that you ended up as a refugee in Lungmen, everyone volunteered to go rescue you.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   We've also accepted many new members there.
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=1)]
[name="Misha"]   But... you're hurting people.
[name="Misha"]   I don't want to... do that...
[name="Misha"]   Why are the Infected fighting each other...
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=2)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   An eye for an eye, as things should be.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   There is a saying in Ursus. 'Welcome your kin as you would welcome the warm spring...'
[name="Skullshatterer"]   'But welcome your enemies...'

[name="Misha"]   What's wrong?
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=2)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   I saw my mother. She grabbed my hand...

[name="Skullshatterer"]   They beat her mercilessly, but she wouldn't let go of me...
[name="Skullshatterer"]   She left a trail of blood in the snow as they dragged her away.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   If Reunion had... If the Infected could have... If only--!
[name="Skullshatterer"]   If they came sooner, none of this would have happened!

[name="Skullshatterer"]   It'll be fine... It'll all be fine in the end.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   I don't blame you.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Back then... who would've been brave enough?
[name="Skullshatterer"]   But now, Reunion has given me that bravery.

[name="Skullshatterer"]   But you are an Infected.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Reunion... will definitely fight until the bitter end so that the Infected can be free.
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=1)]

[name="Skullshatterer"]   ...Innocents?
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Hah. Who's innocent?
[name="Skullshatterer"]   When Chernobog implemented the quarantine, did any of them speak out against it?
[name="Skullshatterer"]   When Ursus sent us to die in the mines and the frozen wastelands, did any of them do anything about it?
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Did any of them ever stand up for us?!

[name="Skullshatterer"]   ...Reunion has two leaders who fought for Ursus for a long time.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   They said that there were some in Ursus who stood against the government for the sake of the Infected.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   But they weren't in Chernobog.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Chernobog coldly turned a blind eye towards us as we died...
[name="Skullshatterer"]   No, they laughed as they watched us die!!

[name="Skullshatterer"]   Rhodes Island?
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Despite being Infected, they helped Lungmen and harmed us, didn't they?

[name="Misha"]   ...
[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=2)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   They slew our comrades and decimated our brethren, didn't they?

[name="Skullshatterer"]   But right now, at least we have hope.

[Character(name="char_012_misa_1#4", name2="char_1500_skulsr", focus=2)]
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Of course.
[name="Skullshatterer"]   Just like how Reunion will protect everyone... I will protect you.
