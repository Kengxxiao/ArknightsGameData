[Character]
Slice, pierce, cleave, sweep, the blades flutter in lockstep with the enemy.
Wail, rage, curse, howl, and then all tends towards the serene.
Rosmontis's expression holds not the slightest change.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] Dealt with.
[name="Rosmontis"] There's no front or ambush positions left. We can continue forward.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] You do a pretty job, Feline. Settled it without any of us even taking a scratch.
[name="Shieldguard"] And you skewer their heads real fast, real precise, no hesitation. That's good form.
[name="Shieldguard"] If only we didn't know you killed the Captain, I'd probably ask you to join us.
[name="Shieldguard"] You're a natural-born warrior. Shame you're with that Cautus, damn shame.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] You can't say bad things about Amiya.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] No, I'm not criticizing her now.
[name="Shieldguard"] I'd been wanting to hear the things she said long, long ago, things I'd heard before.
[name="Shieldguard"] She's great, Feline. A true great one.
[name="Shieldguard"] But this won't get you anywhere, Feline, it won't get you anywhere.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] I don't believe you. Amiya will be able to do it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] Maybe. But you, with her, it's no good for either of you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] You're two kinds of people.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] What two kinds of people? Me and Amiya get along really well. She's taught me a lot of things.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] ...Heh, you'll figure in time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] You're doing this on purpose... I don't want to know.
[name="Rosmontis"] What you just said. I could join you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058")]
[name="Shieldguard"] You can.
[name="Shieldguard"] We welcome anyone.
[name="Shieldguard"] As long as you feel the Infected's fate is unfair, as long as Ursus gets you burning mad, as long as you want to fight.
[name="Shieldguard"] You can join us, then.
[name="Shieldguard"] You thought our team only had Ursus in it? Thought it only kept this country's people? Think again, Feline.

[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2",fadetime=1,block=true)]
[delay(time=3)]
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] ...You're a Feline too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] Born in Rim Billiton, went with my parents to Ursus, and settled down afterwards in this frigid place.
[name="Shieldguard"] I liked picking fights ever since I was young. Decided to join the army later because of it.
[name="Shieldguard"] Ursus's assessments for joining the army are pretty harsh on Felines, but I still passed.
[name="Shieldguard"] And after, I joined the Captain's unit, and went with him, fighting campaigns far and wide. That was ten years.
[name="Shieldguard"] Wars, following wars, and always a war after that. That's Ursus.
[name="Shieldguard"] I used to feel proud of this country, kid.
[name="Shieldguard"] Countless among us used to feel proud of this country.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] So, why...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] Because my parents got Oripathy, got kicked out of the city, and died in the wilderness.
[name="Shieldguard"] And I only learned about it half a year after they'd kicked the bucket.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] ...?! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] Countless among us have gone through something similar.
[name="Shieldguard"] I heard you went through something similar too, kid.
[name="Shieldguard"] But it's not just that.
[name="Shieldguard"] If it was just that, just the one misfortune I ever happened across, I might even be able to understand it.
[name="Shieldguard"] But. That's not how it is.
[name="Shieldguard"] War used to be the only thing that existed inside my head, and the only thing I ever reckoned to accomplish.
[name="Shieldguard"] I started reflecting, thinking some things over, and only then did I start figuring something out about this country, trying to understand this country I used to struggle for.
[name="Shieldguard"] If the Captain weren't there, I'd have probably long been court-martialed for making disrespectful remarks at HQ.
[name="Shieldguard"] After that, I went to the Northern Plains with the Captain.
[name="Shieldguard"] And the rest is history.
[name="Shieldguard"] In all of this, I've learned endurance, learned rage, learned hatred.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] ...Amiya told me not to learn these.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] You'll learn them one way or the other, kid.
[name="Shieldguard"] If you can't use them, chances are they'll swallow you up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] So, was Patriot your family, then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] We fought together for twenty years. He was my best brother, my closest brother-in-arms, and the one I most respected.
[name="Shieldguard"] He was, kid.
[name="Shieldguard"] But I've still gotta say, you're all the more suited to join us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] Then would Amiya be able to join you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] That Cautus? Nope, she wouldn't work.
[name="Shieldguard"] She can't join us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] Then I won't join you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] Hah. I told you. You killed the Captain. There's no way you'd be able to join.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] I don't care.
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] But personally speaking, you need to pay a bit more attention to her. She wants to protect you, but she'll probably die faster than you will.
[Character(name="avg_npc_042")]
[name="Rosmontis"] Why are you that sure?
[Character(name="avg_npc_058_2")]
[name="Shieldguard"] Because we've met someone like her before.
[Dialog]
[Character]
The Shieldguard looks like he's thinking back to something. He pays no more attention to Rosmontis, puts on his helmet once again, and walks off to his comrades-in-arms.
