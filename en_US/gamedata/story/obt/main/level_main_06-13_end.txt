[name="Yeti Squad Member B"]  Everyone's got all kinds.
[Character(name="avg_npc_037")] 
[name="Yeti #1"]  At least you're willing to listen to us. The Ursus soldiers all just shoot us on sight.

[Character(name="avg_npc_037")]

[name="Yeti #1"]  If you can grow a harvest of red wheat, you'll feed half a town's starving Infected.
