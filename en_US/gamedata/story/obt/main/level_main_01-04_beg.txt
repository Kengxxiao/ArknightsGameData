[name="Dobermann"]  Phew... We finally lost them.
[Character(name="char_014_riope", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]  If we keep up the pace, we'll be out of the central region shortly and arrive at the southern exit.
[Character(name="char_014_riope", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  It's starting to get noisier and more chaotic...
[name="Dobermann"]  It might be because the Chernobog civilians trying to evacuate the city are running into Reunion.

[Character(name="char_014_riope", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]  It seems like a few districts have already been vacated.
[name="Ace"]  But those who didn't make it in time are now being held up by Reunion.

[name="Ace"]  ——
[name="Ace"]  This place used to be a magificent, sprawling plaza.Now... it's been reduced to ruins.
[name="Ace"]  This city tormented the Infected. To meet their end this way is almost poetic.
[Character(name="char_014_riope", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  Almost...
[name="Dobermann"]  You seem quite sentimental.
[Character(name="char_014_riope", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=1)]
[name="Ace"]  Perhaps, at one point...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]
[name="Amiya"]  The sky's getting even darker.
[name="Amiya"]  Even the air has the smell... of something burning.

[name="Ace"]  Civilians?
[Character(name="char_014_riope", name2="char_130_doberm_ex", focus=2)]
[name="Dobermann"]  I can't hear anything anymore.
[name="Dobermann"]  We can't tell who they are from this distance.

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  Reunion is attacking them...!
[Character(name="char_014_riope")]
[name="Ace"]  We can't leverage the terrain to our advantage here. We don't have the capacity to save everybody.
[name="Ace"]  Life is very precious, Amiya. Each and every one.
