[name="Amiya"]   We've arrived.
[name="Amiya"]   ...What a depressing place.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   Any mention of this on the news?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   None.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   By the looks of things, Ursus decided to abandon this place.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]   A deserted city, huh...
[name="Ch'en"]   It this city has already become a Reunion stronghold, it's only going to cause more and more problems for Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   It's too close to Lungmen.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   But if Skullshatterer was taking commands from this place, we can't afford to ignore it.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   But... what exactly happened to this part of Chernobog?
[name="Hoshiguma"]   It's impossible for it to have moved this far after being hit by the Catastrophe.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   And why would it appear here?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   From the observation data we've gathered... this happened in the aftermath of the Catastrophe.
[name="Amiya"]   Which means that this subsection was destroyed only after it reached here.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Hah. Seems like Rhodes Island has some skilled Catastrophe Messengers.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   It's good to be cautious.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   We've been ambushed by poorly-organized thugs our entire way here...
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Like vultures circling overhead, looking for carcasses among the ruins.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   It makes my skin crawl.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]   I've confirmed the coordinates. We'll have to continue moving deeper--
[name="Amiya"]   But judging from the terrain, we won't be able to move all our forces together.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma", name2="char_002_amiya_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Are we approaching the Originium-dense parts?

[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#6")]

[name="Hoshiguma"]   Dr. {@nickname}!
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Make sure our operators exercise utmost caution!!
