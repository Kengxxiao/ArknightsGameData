[name="Ch'en"]  Move out.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Operator"]  But we're really not familiar with the layout here. I'm worried... what if the Infected resist our operations?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Relax. I know the area. Just follow my orders.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L. G. D. Operator"]  Yes, Sir!
[name="L. G. D. Operator"]  Sir, bad news: intelligence reports Reunion is moving with some degree of organization again. It seems they've found another commander.
[name="L. G. D. Operator"]  And... and they've reencrypted their communication channels. We can't intercept them anymore!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Could they have joined up with the units in the slums?
[name="Ch'en"]  Impossible. Rhodes Island should already have dealt with the situation there. There's no risk of us getting boxed in.
[name="Ch'en"]  Strange...
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]

[name="Ch'en"]  A transmission?
[name="Ch'en"]  'Little Miss,' would you mind giving me the room?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  How do you work it out so you're busy every time I have something for you?
[name="Swire"]  Is that spy of yours back on the grid?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I said give me the room. And get me some finballs while you're out.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#6",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  I'm not a kid, you know.

[name="Ch'en"]  ...This is Ch'en.
[Character]
[name="???"]  We have another Reunion element up from the lower levels of the slums.
[name="???"]  Infected called Yeti Squad. It seems they have the ability to collapse buildings and destroy infrastructure.
[name="???"]  Tread carefully.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  ...Understood.
[name="Ch'en"]  Only-1, Lungmen's special forces are operating in the slums. We are at the moment incapable of stopping them. Exercise caution.
[Character]
[name="???"]  Roger.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  ...Only-1, why did you drop out of contact?
[Character]
[name="???"]  I had some things on my mind.
[name="???"]  It's clear to me now. I'm leaving Lungmen to you.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  What? I don't understand.
[Character]
[name="???"]  Me, now? I don't belong here.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Only-1!
[Character]
[name="???"]  I'm going to take some of Lungmen's Infected. The L. G. D. can't protect them. The city doesn't care about them.
[name="???"]  In other words, this city isn't at all what you think it is.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Nine! You're under orders!
[Character]
[name="Nine"]  I haven't been with the L. G. D. for over three years.
[name="Nine"]  And actually it was me giving orders to you.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#4")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Nine...!
[Character]
[name="Nine"]  Those special forces you're talking about? I think I've seen them around.
[name="Nine"]  I thought too much of this city. Goodbye, Ch'en.
[name="Nine"]  Oh, right. Don't go snooping around the sewers.

[name="Swire"]  Certainly not! What makes you think I'd worry about a thing like that?
[name="Swire"]  I was just about to give that stinky sewer rat another call.
[name="Swire"]  I may not come here often, but I'm pretty sure those special forces are up to no good.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Have you met Lin? From the slums?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  I have. He's a nice old man. Nicer than my grandpa anyway.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  They call him the 'Rat King.'
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  The men behind the curtain aren't all like such. But he's really a good person.
[name="Swire"]  I never thought Yühsia would turn out like this. She was such a shy and timid girl, the kind who would always hide behind you.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I don't think she's changed. She just... took on responsibility. Maybe the kind she couldn't handle.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  It wouldn't do any good to tell her that. We're between a rock and hard place here.

[name="Ch'en"]  I can't say I understand what's going on between her and her father, but I know she's not so cold-blooded.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  So I'm gonna call her.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  ......
[name="Ch'en"]  That report I just got may be of use to us.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  What do you mean?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  A Reunion group with special powers has entered the slums, and they're able to command other Reunion elements.
[name="Ch'en"]  And I'm the only one who knows. Well, now it's the two of us, I guess.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  What are you thinking?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  We steer the raincoats into them.
[name="Ch'en"]  Aside from the group left to help the L. G. D. clean up the new-type Infected, there's also quite a few of those special forces with us in the slums.
[name="Ch'en"]  And the situation is: we don't know their distribution, we have no way to guard against them, and have no idea what they might do.
[name="Ch'en"]  But with Lin Yühsia's help, we can guide them into that Reunion team.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Force them out? Show them to the whole L. G. D.?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  The L. G. D., sure, but also Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  You trust them so much?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  They chase their objectives harder than any group I've ever seen. They're even more dedicated than the L. G. D.
[name="Ch'en"]  And who else are we going to trust?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  You've got stones, I'll give you that.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Ordinary Lungmenites don't know Lin, they don't know your grandfather, they don't even really know Wei Yenwu, let alone any chambers of commerce or whatever behind the scenes.
[name="Ch'en"]  They just trust the L. G. D. None of those players would dare disband the L. G. D., and leave us with the regular old police.
[name="Ch'en"]  Then you add in the outsiders... And there's no way they'll want to take over.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  They'll fire you though.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#3",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Whoop-de-doo.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#2",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  Then let's wrap up this one last job! Next time, their patrol route goes right into the slums.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#2",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You can get Lin on board?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  As long as we look after this place, Lin will work with us.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  One more thing...
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  What's that?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Did you know we have three guests?

[Character]
[name="Swire"]  Have I ever lied to you?

[Character(name="avg_npc_036")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Forget it. I don't care.
[Character]
[name="Swire"]  Yühsia, your dad has done so much for Lungmen. We don't want to lose this place, and the people here can't lose us either.
[Character(name="avg_npc_036")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Liar. You're coming here?
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  You'll come to the slums?
[Character]
[name="Swire"]  ......Ch'en will.
[Character(name="avg_npc_036")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  You really are a terrible liar. What business have I with her?
[Character]
[name="Swire"]  For whatever reason, your dad wasn't able to resolve the conflict between the Infected and the normal people, but Ch'en can.
[name="Swire"]  Ch'en and your father will rebuild the slums together.
[name="Swire"]  They're working to turn it into a place where all kinds of people can live, to the point that we won't even be able to call it the slums anymore.
[name="Swire"]  Think about it... Even though most Lungmenites don't live here, they've been coming here a lot in the past few years, haven't they?
[name="Swire"]  Soon, we won't need any slums.
[Character(name="avg_npc_036")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  What? 
[Character]
[name="Swire"]  We haven't been able to solve the Infected crisis, but I know... We can make this a better place.
[name="Swire"]  They'll be Lungmen's downtown Districts 22 to 29. No longer 'slums.'
[name="Swire"]  This city was built on the many, many different kinds of people all coming together to make it what it is today.
[name="Swire"]  Lungmen can't afford to lose anyone.
[Character(name="avg_npc_036")]
[name="Lin Yühsia"]  Yawn. How boring. You've become as boring as Ch'en.
[Character]
[name="Swire"]  Yühsia...
[name="Swire"]  Look, I'm not trying to make a soap opera here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_036")]
