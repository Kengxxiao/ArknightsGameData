[name="Dobermann"]  Even if that's the case, we can't let her hear this!
[name="Dobermann"]  We mustn't burden her any further. She's already... carrying the weight of the world on her shoulders.

[name="Dobermann"]  They made the ultimate choice to let us live, so we have to return the favor... by making sure Amiya and the Doctor return safely.
