[name="Talulah"] Are you oka—
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#2")]
[name="Old Man"] What have you done! Oh, God, Talulah... Look at what you've done! 
[name="Old Man"] Talulah, we'll have to transport the village in two days. Just look at what you've...! 
[name="Old Man"] You fought a patrolman! There'll be hell to pay now! 
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#2",name2="avg_npc_078#3",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] Letting him beat you was even less of an idea. It's getting late, and he's on the run. If I kill him now, we'll be long gone by the time the others find his remains.  
[name="Talulah"] But that wouldn't solve any of our problems. Once the patrol unit regroups, they'd still come looking for us. They might well be out to get revenge on us. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#2",name2="avg_npc_078#3",focus=1)]
[name="Old Man"] And yet you did it! Now what do we do!? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#2",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] Calm down. They're looking for Infected. They still don't know.

[name="Old Man"] ......
[name="Old Man"] Don't know what?
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#5",name2="avg_npc_078",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] They don't know what I'm about to do.

[name="Old Man"] Hey... Talulah!
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#5",name2="avg_npc_078#2",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] It's okay. Come on, I'll walk you back. 
[name="Talulah"] Your leg there... It will need special attention to heal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#5",name2="avg_npc_078#2",focus=1)]
[name="Old Man"] Hah. So today's the day you start helping me walk? Always thought I was still in good shape myself. Who'd've guessed I couldn't outrun it?  
[name="Old Man"] Talulah, there's something I need to tell you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#5",name2="avg_npc_078#2",focus=2)]
[name="Talulah"] What is it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_092#5")]
[name="Old Man"] ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_092")]
[name="Old Man"] Ah, good question. Heh, hahah, sorry, I don't remember. Look at me now. Look at my memory...  
[Character(name="avg_npc_078#2")]
[name="Talulah"] ......
[name="Talulah"] That's some impressive forgetfulness, alright.
