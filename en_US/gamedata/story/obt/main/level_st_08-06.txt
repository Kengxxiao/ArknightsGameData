[name="Kal'tsit"]  Are you worried we're going to get ourselves killed?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  No need, Dr. {@nickname}, that ship has long since sailed. It sailed as soon as we got involved here. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We have two swords hanging over our heads: one is Lungmen's and one belongs to the Third Army of Ursus.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We stopped the core city, we got involved in the attack on Lungmen, and we know the entire conspiracy. That's enough to have them plotting to destroy us.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What would the Third Army do if Lungmen decided to strike at us?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  They'd grab the popcorn.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The murderers in their fancy uniforms would watch our landship burn into a scorched hulk in the wastelands, one of the thorns in their side melting away.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And on the other side, a private company without registration in Lungmen, not under the protection of Lungmen, finds itself attacked and destroyed by unknown forces.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That doesn't sound like a problem for Lungmen or Yan, does it?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Unless, of course, we're holding Talulah.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Anyone who might want to strike at us first needs to consider the signal they're sending. Does it say to their rivals that they need Talulah? That she's key to this case? 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That she grants an advantage, that she could eliminate a weakness? 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That is our one and only chance at survival.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It is to Rhodes Island's great advantage that the magnates of Lungmen and the ancient nobility of Ursus will not find common ground in the next century.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If we hold Talulah, their hands are tied. Neither will want to make the first move.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Neither will want to risk the evidence vital to both sides. Their best course of action will be to remain at a safe distance. Both parties want to distance themselves from this smoking gun. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It would take only one slight misstep to bring ruin to either the Third Army or Lungmen. Neither has the authority to stand for their entire country. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Third Army tried, once. And they will pay a terrible price for the mistake. The stakes are too high.  
[name="Kal'tsit"]  So we will seize the advantage in this situation. We will use each side to protect ourselves from the other. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Talulah is vital to our survival. At least for now. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Those clever enough to survive will find a balancing point, and with Talulah in our hands, Rhodes Island can actively choose to be that very point. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  At least until this all blows over, or they're swept up in the next storm. 
[Decision(options="I won't be able to convince you.;......;You planned this from the start, didn't you?", values="1;2;3")]
[Predicate(references="1;2;3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  *Sigh*...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There's the aircraft. Time to go. Get Talulah and Amiya in first. 
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We'll take the next one.

Over the next thirty-six hours, the soldiers from Ursus's Third Army who had infiltrated the Chernobog core city quietly vanished.
Of course, no one could prove they were Ursus soldiers.
Before leaving the core city, the Shieldguards found Reunion corpses with no identifying items, except for the wounds in their flesh... 
They were all caused by the same thrown weapon.
The formless killers planned to kill the heavies they knew, sending a quiet warning to the unseen parties who were not present.
Of course, the Shieldguards were more direct with their message. Traitors drown in their own blood.

A joint investigation team from Yan and Ursus submitted their reports two weeks after arriving in Chernobog.
They were clear: there was zero evidence that either of the two countries had anything to do with the tragedy.
They determined that the Chernobog Incident was created and caused by the Infected. 
But the vagaries of political conflict meant that any further legal action to be taken against the Infected that might have been circulating in the major cities ultimately died in various legislatures, piles of unpassable bills...
Until finally meeting an unceremonious end in the old secretary's crank shredder during a cleanup.
Thus, the Chernobog Incident silently drew to a close.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]  This is where Talulah's father is buried... And your mother.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  In the end, they couldn't be buried in the city they loved. Or, in the case of your mother, it was a matter of both love and hate. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I'll never forget the look of this place, Hui-chieh. I think of them whenever I see it... my sister, and my sworn brother, with whom I shared no blood. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  They are buried here.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  A place too small to house their passion, words too weak to express their remorse.
[Character(name="avg_npc_086",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  An unmarked grave.
[Character(name="avg_npc_086",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Yes. Heh... names perhaps mean more to the living. 
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  All around the world, we idealize burial, as all graves eventually disappear. No one knows a peaceful, eternal sleep. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Catastrophe, war, abandonment, and all such things. Should a city disappear, the souls buried within disappear right along with it. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  And in the countless settlements that dot the land, I have never yet found one where the descendants knew the location of the graves of their ancestors.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  There is a form of burial called the Tombway, it denotes a part of a nomadic city's pathing as the burial ground, where the dead will be tossed from the city, with the passing cycle as a form of honor.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I'm too forgetful. Too many things I forget too easily, too many things I want so desperately to forget. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  But dare not ever forget them.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  And so... I picked this place for them.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I brought my sister to Lungmen, I met Fumizuki in Lungmen, along with Edward, who had fled to Lungmen.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I can't say we made the best of friends, but he was smart, and bold.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Kashchey ruled Lungmen from the shadows, and saw us as thorns in his side. We knew we had no choice but to depose him... it was the only way to give us a future in the city. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Here, this grave, is the farthest Lungmen had ever been.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  After we beat Kashchey and exiled him from Lungmen, the city sat a few dozen miles away, bright, and full of hope. Our future awaited us.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  We drank, talked, laughed, enjoyed ourselves without a thought to our remaining fuel.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  We very nearly died of thirst until Adams, that sick old tiger, coughed up his car to come get us. Boy did he give Edward and I the business after that.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Oh... he wasn't as old then. Nor was he as sick, or ferocious. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  But who cares? We were all having a good time. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Lin was laughing... laughing like we didn't have blood on our hands... laughing like we were boys in the time of our lives.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Edward was the scion of the highest Londinium nobility. And we were keeping that secret in Lungmen. But Kashchey already knew, he may have long since started plotting.  
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  He told my jealous twin and the Shadow of Londinium about Edward and my sister... about their relationship...
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I was forced to choose between Edward or my sister's unborn child.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I hid it for ten years after Edward died. Only my brother and Kashchey knew. But now, Edward and my sister are both gone from this world. 
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Someday, a Catastrophe will strike and wipe away everything. No one will remember the tragic lovers buried here. These two, who died because of me, will be forgotten. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_086")]
[name="Ch'en"]  I met 'Kashchey.' He may be more evil than either of us know.

[name="Ch'en"]  ...Mother.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1#5")]

[name="Ch'en"]  Even so, I can't just let her go. I still don't know what she is, it's still not clear. 
[name="Ch'en"]  There's a prison to keep criminals, but Lungmen we know today can't hold her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_086",name2="char_2005_weiyw_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I can't make the Lungmen that could. Only you can create an L.G.D. that could keep the Infected and the uninfected together.

[name="Ch'en"]  It doesn't have to be me. We all have our own part to play. 
[name="Ch'en"]  I know that truth, no matter how correct it might be. If the people of Lungmen don't accept it, then they won't. I've seen too much of the slums. 
[name="Ch'en"]  And if it is possible to build something like that, I'd like to do it with Rhodes Island first.

I broke that vow.

[name="Siege"]  Alright, Dr. Kal'tsit.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Just a moment. One question. Are you ready? 
[name="Siege"]  I'm not sure. But I guess I'm ready whenever.

[name="Islam Witte"]  Your Majesty...
[name="Islam Witte"]  Here is the completed report on the incident.
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  —How did this happen?
[name="Fyodor"]  Did one of the Royal Guards betray us?
[name="Fyodor"]  Witte, give me an honest answer.
[name="Fyodor"]  My chest is an unlit fireplace on a winter day. Only honest words will get my heart beating again, whether or not an unpleasant truth may break it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  No. Your Royal Guards would never betray Your Majesty. They will remain loyal to you until the world itself is consumed by fire, as long as you are the rightful Emperor of Ursus.  
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  You and I both know those are but empty words. Would that the Guard did more than stand back and watch the old monster die... 
[name="Fyodor"]  Enough! No more platitudes, no more masks, I've grown weary! Witte, you are no fool. Tell me your thoughts! And look me in the eye as you do!   
[name="Fyodor"]  Where are the puppetmasters behind this plot?
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  ——
[name="Islam Witte"]  Grand Duke Baikal, Deputy Marshal of the Third Army and Governor General Rosin, and Viscount Kerque.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Of course, I still lack the evidence to prove that they actually orchestrated the entire ordeal.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Further, when the Royal Guard went to hang them all in their homes. They found...
[name="Islam Witte"]  These traitors, lacking the courage to face their crimes and your wrath, they took their own lives rather than bear their due punishment. 
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  Cowards... absolute cowards! Have they not even the meager courage it takes to stand trial?
[name="Fyodor"]  They must have known! They knew that a trial would reveal their base desires, their corrupted minds, to all the people of Ursus! 
[name="Fyodor"]  And yet... now we will never bring them to trial.
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  True, Your Majesty. How regrettable that we must now keep this knowledge behind the curtain, rather than take it out onto the stage. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  Even a stupid burdenbeast will do more than chew grass when roused.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Nevertheless, the Royal Guard disposed of their remains in the proper manner.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Their rotten corpses will dangle, stinking from the ceiling. No one will dare take them down.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Had their conspiracy succeeded, Ursus would have suffered another war, they would have seen their influence increase, proportionally draining the power of the Council... perhaps further degrading our cities.
[name="Islam Witte"]  We are most fortunate they failed.
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  Traitors! Death was too good for them. I should feed them to the Flesh Buthidas! 
[name="Fyodor"]  But... that would be a terrible thing. No. We can't do that.  
[name="Fyodor"]  Pardon me, Witte. I didn't mean to lash out like that.
[name="Fyodor"]  We must not go back down the road of ruin. No matter how much rage I have for my enemies, I cannot exhibit such behavior. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  You did not resort to them during the Great Rebellion. To this day, I feel that only a proper, blood-soaked threat would have stirred them. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  Pure terror is the only language those who terrorize the innocent can understand.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Although I am personally opposed to such measures.
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  Unfathomable.
[name="Fyodor"]  Must I resort to such ancient brutality, such poisonous traditions to stand against the ignorant?
[name="Fyodor"]  And as these maggots seize the swords and shields of our empire, are even we left to naught but rot? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  Forgive me, Your Majesty. I do not have an answer to that question. From a constitutional perspective, I am not your legal spymaster. 
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  More importantly, Witte, is the legend true? Is the 'Deathless Black Snake' a malignant deity that cannot be slain? 
[name="Fyodor"]  And are there other such deities like it in our realm? What can we do to free our people from this tyranny? 
[name="Fyodor"]  Witte, we stand now in the light... surrounded by darkness! Can we use fire to illuminate Ursus? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  Your Majesty, I must point to one fact. In recent decades, only the Duke of Kashchey, among all the Ageless, shows clear signs of involvement in these events. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  And even after his death, we are unable to confirm her identity. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  That tells us that the Ageless of Ursus... still fear you.
[name="Islam Witte"]  They fear you and your contempt.
[name="Islam Witte"]  Nearly a thousand years have passed since we overthrew the Hippogryph. A couple of dying monsters cannot stand against the might of the Ursus people. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  Let them do as they will. They will fail. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  We will find them, and we will destroy them. Your Majesty need not worry. 
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  I hope it all proceeds as you've said.
[name="Fyodor"]  What of the Infected situation? Any developments? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  Your Majesty is overhasty. You acted too quickly to close the Infected mines the armies held in the northwest. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  It may have been your hope to weaken the Army's supply reserves, or even show a little benevolence—
[name="Islam Witte"]  But as much as the Army opposes you, your people also oppose this. They fear the Infected. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  It is unwise to go against your people, at this juncture. They by and large despise the Infected, and standing against the Army here could be seen as you standing against the people.
[name="Islam Witte"]  You lack the resources to pursue this course.
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  ......
[name="Fyodor"]  Even if it's the right thing to do?
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  Even if it's the right thing to do. This is to show leniency to the Infected by shoveling them into the jaws of hell. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  It is time, Your Majesty. Yurodstvo has been waiting at the door for over fifteen minutes. I think you may want to see to him.  
[Character]
[name="Fyodor"]  Hmph. Raving lunatic with his holy visions! I'll make a proper joke of him. 
[name="Fyodor"]  But before that, Witte, do you think we can do it? Can we make Ursus great again? 
[Character(name="avg_npc_076")]
[name="Islam Witte"]  I don't know, Your Majesty. Now is not an appropriate time to answer you. 
[name="Islam Witte"]  But at least you do not lay waste to the world as your father did. That is already quite good.

[name="Islam Witte"]  Should you break the curse of the Deathless Black Snake, then you should be able to break through everything that weighs upon you.
[name="Islam Witte"]  I hope that one day we have a real chance to defeat the country of the last emperor.

[name="Talulah"]  (Sorry to bother you.) 
[name="FrostNova"]  (You didn't. It's just the one with the white hair... he's a light sleeper. If I don't sing to him, he has night terrors. I don't know what he's been through.

[name="Talulah"]  (It's already so late.) 
[name="FrostNova"]  (I've never seen him sleep. Not once.)  
[name="Talulah"]  (Heroes need rest too. The other fighters should've taken some.)  
[name="FrostNova"]  (Think of yourself before him. Who was that you reached out to a few days ago? Where were they from?)   
[name="Talulah"]  (Lyudmila and Alex. Looks like they've been around Chernobog. They know the city well.)  
[name="FrostNova"]  (That's a big city.) 
[name="Talulah"]  (Yes. And with lots of Infected in it. We might be able to bring them in... with the right plan.)   
[name="Talulah"]  (Lyudmila and the people with her seem strong. I think they might become dependable allies, even if they're a little ornery right now.)  
[name="FrostNova"]  (Ornery as those of us fighting the Ursus Army all the time?) 
[name="FrostNova"]  (Chernobog. It's too far, and too many things stand in our way. How many years would it take? Three or four still wouldn't get us there.)    
[name="Talulah"]  (Even if we don't fight it or stop it... it will have to come to us. With the efforts of the Infected in the city, we can build a city of our own.)  
[name="Talulah"]  (And maybe, in three or four years' time... we'll be looking at tomorrow. Tomorrow is so close.)  
[name="FrostNova"]  (I like the sound of that.) 
[name="FrostNova"]  (Get some rest.) 
[name="Talulah"]  (Right. Good night.) 
[name="Talulah"]  (Good night, Sasha, and Eno.) 
[name="FrostNova"]  (Hurry back. I'll send the kids to the settlement soon.)  
[name="Talulah"]  (Right.)
