[name="Talulah?"] Lord of Fiends... You've done well.
[name="Talulah?"] Yet, I remain troubled by that baseless confidence you and that young dragon continue to show.
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] Are you finally giving up the guise?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] Who am I talking to now? Is it the changed Talulah, or a young Kashchey?
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Denouncing my actions, insulting my person, continuously dragging forth memories from deep within my mind——
[name="Talulah?"] Did you think that you could subdue me like this? Force me to surrender?
[name="Talulah?"] Or did you think that I would be suppressed by the dragon-slaying sword of Yan and the filthy Arts of the Sarkaz? Free for your Arts to do with this body as you wish, to regain some semblance of 'purity'?
[name="Talulah?"] ——That is the extent of your oratory skills.
[name="Talulah?"] Why do you stand against me?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1")]
[name="Ch'en"] Your conceit only feeds your arrogance. It only means you have that much further to fall.
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] However young you may be, you are still the Lord of Fiends in the end. Attempting to persuade me, convincing my inner heart, telling me there is a foreign being trying to take over this body and that I should struggle free.
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] Nnh...!
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"] Frankly, aren't you unsure as well?
[name="Talulah?"] If memories and emotions can be falsified, does Kashchey truly exist?
[name="Talulah?"] What does it mean if Kashchey doesn't actually exist?
[Character(name="avg_npc_087#3")]
[name="Amiya"] This has nothing to do with you, Kashchey.
[name="Amiya"] We want to defeat you not because of what you have experienced, but because of what you have done.
[name="Amiya"] We cannot allow you to continue harming others. No matter what reasons you may have, it's just as Madam Ch'en said...
[name="Amiya"] We don't care.
[name="Amiya"] Regardless if you are Kashchey or Talulah.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#2")]
[name="Ch'en"] ...Get the hell out of my sister's body.
[name="Ch'en"] ...I wanted to say that, but it seems to just be an excuse for you. If you do have an excuse, save it for the judge.
[name="Ch'en"] Amiya, get ready. Let's go!
[Character(name="char_011_talula_1")]
[name="Talulah?"]  Have you been... mislead... by the power I'm displaying right now?
[name="Talulah?"] Let me repeat myself. Everyone in this city who could kill me is now dead. Besides Patriot, no one in the Chernobog core city could have done it.
[name="Talulah?"] FrostNova, the frosty nightmare of the tundra died at Lungmen, just as I planned.
[name="Talulah?"] Even if you use these two swords... you don't hold a candle to them.
[name="Talulah?"] I've given you the wrong impression.
[name="Talulah?"] If this body was not willing, I would not be able to accomplish anything.
[name="Talulah?"] But now, what exactly is this body of mine restraining? I do not understand.
[name="Talulah?"] I shall liberate it, just as I once liberated all destruction.

The Draco reaches for the longsword. Her fingers brush across the blade's edge, leaving a trail of blood painted across it.
She laughs.
[Character]
Ch'en tries to speak, yet her body refuses. Something is flowing around her neck.
Amiya gestures towards her, an image appearing within her mind. Ch'en realizes that they are indeed caught within Talulah's Arts.
Should Ch'en open her mouth to speak, the heat around her mouth would rapidly increase, burrowing into her esophagus and incinerating her from within.
Amiya turns to glare at Talulah, but it's too late. The Arts have already taken effect. The Draco's voice reverberates within the roiling heat, but Amiya and Ch'en are forced to remain silent.
Ch'en feels as if her lungs are riddled with holes, her breath labored and tortured.
The Draco's Arts seem to deliberately differentiate between volitional expressions and involuntary movements. It seems to Ch'en then even Talulah cannot force her Arts to work on all concepts.
That's why Talulah chose their mouths. The red dragon simply wishes for the two to stay silent.
Ch'en grits her teeth.
The temperature is still rising. As time passes, it will inevitably reach its climax, and the two will die. After all, they cannot cut apart the blistering air that surrounds their bodies.
[name="Talulah?"] Countless lives vanish before me, and I grieve for them. Yet, I can only continue moving forward. Because I know. The glorious nation I serve demands fresh blood. It wishes for death. It calls for humility.
[name="Talulah?"] It disappeared, then emerged once more; It disintegrated, then was rebuilt; It died a sudden death, then was resurrected.
[name="Talulah?"] 'I journey across the plains of salt, the bleeding mountain valleys, and not once was I harmed.' 
[name="Talulah?"] 'For his sword, his territory, his subjects, they grant me protection.'

[name="Talulah?"] Who do you think are the two sides of this battle?
[name="Talulah?"] You think they are the Infected and non-Infected. You think that it is justice and injustice.
[name="Talulah?"] Wrong. That's all wrong.
[name="Talulah?"] This is the reason you cannot defeat me.
[name="Talulah?"] One side is simply doing as they wish for their own goals, acting on emotion alone... Weak-willed fools who do not even understand the meaning of war.
[name="Talulah?"] Whereas the other side is those suffering in Ursus... The people who live in pain under the discrimination of others.
[name="Talulah?"] You don't care? You don't have the right to care. How could you possibly fathom the love we have towards our land?
[name="Talulah?"] I love them, those warriors who fight for this country, those passionate people who willingly spill their own blood upon the battlefield... No matter who they see as an enemy, I love them all!
[name="Talulah?"] They entrust their lives to their faith. It's fine even if they go against Ursus in a moment of prejudice and shortsightedness.
[name="Talulah?"] Because, this land will forever love them.
[name="Talulah?"] Those dignitaries whose brains are full of shit, who mock the sacrifices and victims among the common folk... I love them too.
[name="Talulah?"] My love towards them will not falter just because of their actions! Because love is alike, it is equal, it is normal.
[name="Talulah?"] Those uninfected who fight for the Infected, those Infected who refuse to give up——I love them all! 
[name="Talulah?"] The way they pursue life is thousands of times better than the trash who waste their lives away meaninglessly!
[name="Talulah?"] But I love all the people of Ursus. Whether strong or weak, benevolent or tyrannical, altruistic or greedy.
[name="Talulah?"] To Ursus, all lives are equal. We are all grains of sand in Ursus.   
[name="Talulah?"] Some people deserve a better life from birth! But they cannot and will not choose so.
[name="Talulah?"] Because fate is blind. They must undergo these unreasonable hardships, so that they may grow stronger and mature.
[name="Talulah?"] Some people must be punished.
[name="Talulah?"] But they cannot, for their lives are still important. They will push forward the great river of time, where things will move and plans implemented, until the time when they are drowned and greatness is newly cast.
[name="Talulah?"] I love them all.
[name="Talulah?"] Not because of origin, not because of deeds, not because of identity, not because of personality.
[name="Talulah?"] I love everyone on this land.
[name="Talulah?"] It has been so for a thousand years.

[PlaySound(key="$fireburst", volume=1)] 
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Amiya, oh Amiya. Do you know why you are so shortsighted, why you are so weak?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Because you only stand in your own two shoes. Do you know how narrow your vision is? How much misfortune have you ever seen?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You've only seen some unremarkable scenes through the eyes of the Lord of Fiends, yet you presume to act as if you have personally experienced it...
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I've experienced far more tragedy than you ever have.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You are constrained by your identity as an orphaned Infected, whereas I am the observer of the entirety of Ursus.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I live to save the vast land and crying people you cannot see. What about you?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You are but fools, blind and deaf, despairing over the littlest of things, proclaiming yourself saviors. 
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Could you ever imagine what has taken place across this world? You cannot.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] The language, history and memories you see are all just short excerpts of self-glorification. You cannot see the scars carved onto the living by fate itself.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Scars can kill. The scars of millions of my Ursus kin are etched onto my body.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Ch'en Hui-chieh. You are my sister in blood and flesh. You stand here against me and view Ursus as your enemy, all because you think it is invading your homeland.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] If you cannot even defeat your own sister, do you believe for a second that you will prevail against the entirety of Ursus?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] What's more, whether or not Ursus will be dragged into this war, and whatever the result of the war may be, matters not to me.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] All I want is for this land to free itself from the impasse and dissonance it finds itself in. After this war ends, there will inevitably be a winner and a loser, whether it is the military government or a new emperor.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] The previous Ursus emperor was like the incarnation of the soul of Ursus.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] He did not lose himself in pleasure, and maintained a healthy distance from power despite his lofty ambitions. He could not be called the embodiment of lust, and was as far from a tyrant as could be.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] However, he brought about wars, for Ursus needs wars. Ursus needs wars for its people to grow.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] He was exceptional. He was worthy of being called an emperor of Ursus.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] As for you, Infected.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] 'Why don't you bow down in front of them and wag your tails desperately like the beasts you are? You may receive their forgiveness that way.' 
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You wish to be accepted by everyone?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Of course you can... Just accept the fodder they give you, abandon the language of people and become slaves. Hand over a quarter of your own for them to squander and slaughter.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] They will see you as harmless livestock, a pet that looks disgustingly like a person yet is interesting enough to keep around. An accessory that they may grant meager protection to console their miserable pride.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You will struggle and die, yet there will always be countless new lives ready to take your place. Your kin will be reduced to such, then and forever.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] ——Because those fools can only feel forgiveness and satisfaction through such a method. The great systems of power are always established for the sake of you and them... the slave and the master.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] No one else will treat you as fairly as Ursus and I. We know how despicable the Ursus may be, yet we have no choice but to let you live in their shadow.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] If you think that is evil, then so be it. Because this evil perpetuated a mentality of pathetic salvation that spanned nations, that caused life to be so.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Until today.
[PlaySound(key="$fireburst", volume=1)] 
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I will change everything. I gave them direction.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] The exceptional once-ruler of this nation brought greatness to them, yet even he could not escape the grasp of time. In the end, he could not bring salvation to the Infected.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] In war, their irrational parts are sated, their non-intelligent parts are perfused, their mediocre parts become extraordinary, their indifferent thoughts become fanatic.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Those people gain a sort of nobility.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] To tame and use them is an act of foolishness rather than wisdom. We do not need their allegiance, nor do we want to rule over them.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I will let them restore their lost dignity.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] In the future of Ursus, the same holds true for the Infected.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I will bring about exaltation and equality, for the Infected and non-Infected, for Ursus and other nations.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Inevitably, a winner will emerge between the borderland armies and the State Council. I fan the flames of this war, so that they may decide immediately.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] As time passes, life is eroded and passion is ousted. When Ursus becomes incapable of setting off the slightest spark, its lands and people will rot and become lost in the annals of history.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I will never let that happen.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] I had intentionally let Reunion fall here, to be regathered in my hand and crumble once again, just so that there is a starting point to all this.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Yet, you deny all of this. You deny everything that I will do for Ursus.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] How can your shortsightedness see the events a century henceforth?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] How can you even begin to imagine the Infected and non-Infected united in their struggle? Why would you disrupt the peace and glory that will follow a thousand years, simply for the sake of a little suffering today?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] In the end, you are too immature.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You have never experienced despair at the brink of destruction. The Infected may struggle, but they still live on. In contrast, Ursus has nearly fallen to ruin in a single night on multiple occasions.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Have you ever listened to the cavalry of Khagan galloping across the land, the sound of weapons clashing so thunderously they can level mountains and shift rivers?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Have you ever heard the shrill cries of the Kheshigs of Nightzmora as they run their scimitars across their skulls?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Have you ever experienced the ear-splitting sound of thousands of Warriors of Rus firing simultaneously, reducing the high and mighty Gauls to little more than ashes amongst the blood and mud?
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] You are clueless, but I don't blame you for that.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] If you really wish to put your foolish thoughts into action and prevent the revival of Ursus, the reunification of the Ursus under the same banner of faith, the revitalization of the Ursus land...
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Then, try and stop me. Try and stop this incarnation of Ursus.
[name="'Deathless Black Snake'"] Come.
