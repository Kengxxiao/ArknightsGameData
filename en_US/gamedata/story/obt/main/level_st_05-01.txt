[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  Yes, Chief Wei.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Very well then.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I must apologize, leader of Rhodes Island. Though I can risk sending the L.G.D. deep into enemy territory, I can't risk bringing any more players into this game.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Beneath this entire land lies an invisible, yet intricate net.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  No single city can break free from this net of conspiracy and intrigue - and especially not Lungmen, as it is situated in the midsts of giants.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Perhaps you already know this, perhaps you don't. Nevertheless, I have to take all these factors into consideration.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  Chief Wei, you should have shared this information with us if you wanted our mission to progress more smoothly.
[name="Amiya"]  At least, you should have told me.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_002_amiya_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I must apologize yet again, Miss Amiya. From my position, I simply cannot disclose all our intel.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  If you were standing in my shoes, you would have made the same decision.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  What happened in the Chernobog ruins was a pity, but at least you achieved something.

[name="Blaze"]  Hah, well said, Dr. {@nickname}! Chief, of course you'd need us to hold Reunion back. The more the better, right?
[name="Blaze"]  When the lurking Reunion saw Lungmen in such a state, there's no way they wouldn't spring at the opportunity.
[name="Blaze"]  And as soon as they began to emerge from their lairs, then BAM! Lungmen's elite forces would be waiting for them, seemingly out of nowhere.
[name="Blaze"]  How long have you been concealing Lungmen's power? Did you already start preparing for this after the Chernobog incident?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=1)]  
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Lungmen kept you safe, and helped you return to a position that could maximize your value.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Blaze"]  You left Amiya to die back there in the middle of so many enemies. What kind of 'position' are you talking about?
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=1)]  
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I just hope that Rhodes Island can understand that we all have to face this difficult situation together.
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Amiya"]  Miss Blaze, Dr. {@nickname}, it's fine.
[name="Amiya"]  Miss Swire helped us to defeat Reunion's forces, together. Lungmen did not abandon us.
[name="Amiya"]  (We don't have any proof.)
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_017_homura_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Blaze"]  Tch...
[Character(name="char_empty",name2="char_002_amiya_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Our agreement is still valid. No matter what happened during the process, only the end result can satisfy me.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  No matter what happened.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Dr. {@nickname} of Rhodes Island, I believe I made myself clear the last time we met.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  You do not have a choice in this matter. But at least you can choose how you eliminate your enemies.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Isn't that for the best?
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  We should all stay alert. Nobody should let their guard down when we are facing a common enemy.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Your vigilance can keep you from falling into a trap.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Listen, Dr. {@nickname}—
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  ...We may not be friends yet, but at least we are not enemies.
[Predicate(references="2")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  So, silence is your answer.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  A fine display of judgment. You would hide your weaknesses while pressing your advantages.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Rhodes Island indeed is a powerful partner. You have earned my recognition from this incident.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  But, this comes on the condition that our relationship is still a partnership, not a statement of the status between illegal Infected and local authorities.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]  I do not intend to fool anyone.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Though, objectively speaking, I may well have fooled Reunion.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  But none of that can be proven. Reunion may also have access to our secrets.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  We can only hope to destroy them before they come to grasp our strategies.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  So, does this goal motivate you at all?
[Predicate]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  Miss Amiya, Dr. {@nickname}, the cooperation between us has not ended yet.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]  A counterattack is imminent. We will demonstrate Lungmen's stature, wisdom, and unity to them.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]  That's not important. Lungmen should be able to handle its own problems, once and for all. That is our first principle.
