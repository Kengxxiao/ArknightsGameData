[name="Hoshiguma"]  That was easier than I expected. Really makes me more and more curious as to what happened in Chernobog.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Perhaps it's the same thing as what happened here, except the roots sank in deeper and the flames burned with more intensity. Don't let your guard down.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You should know that I rarely close my eyes when I'm sleeping.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ugh. I was trying to end the fighting as soon as possible, but we still ended up damaging so many shops.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I'm afraid Mister Wei is going to end up footing the bill again, especially because he's not fond of the li'l Miss's family in the first place.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Hey, it's Swarovski Crystal. Ch'en, isn't this your favorite brand?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Not really. The pendants are nice, but the earrings aren't that good.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Squad B1, Ch'en here. Block the west entrance and lower all the security gates.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I rarely see you wear earrings.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Well, I'm usually in uniform because of work. The few outfits I do have are gathering cobwebs in my wardrobe.
[Character(name="char_015_lmg")]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Madam Hoshiguma! This is the L3 floor plan of East Paci Plaza after Reunion modified it. Please look over it!
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Good job. Continue with the investigation, and try to utilize the terrain to our advantage.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Afterwards, we'll find the best route to cross Reunion's blockade from here. We can't make do without your information.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_015_lmg",focus=2)]
[name="L.G.D. Agent"]  Roger!
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Clothes, huh... It's hard picturing you as someone who spends money on that kind of stuff.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Aren't you the same way with your countless motorbikes? What's wrong with wanting to look nice for yourself every now and then?
[name="Ch'en"]  Work takes up most of my time, but it's not my whole life after all.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I'd be more likely to believe you if you didn't show up early every morning like clockwork, as well as taking on overtime hours that would scare anyone else to death.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I guess all you can say is that life is tolerable for cops like us.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Sometimes I ask myself, for those Infected like Amiya... Will they have a chance to go out shopping? Maybe to buy some accessories they like, or eat some of their favorite food?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Perhaps one day. But that day is not here yet.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  C3, Ch'en here. Clear the first floor and push forward slowly. Safety first.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I guess so. This patch of dirt truly is unfair. Phal died, but I get to live on.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  They all died, and only I got to live.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ch'en. Is that intel really worthwhile?
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  It has to be.
