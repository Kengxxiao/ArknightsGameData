[name="Franka"]   The enemy is lurking... we're being followed and watched.
[name="Franka"]   Are they trying to wear us down until they have the perfect opportunity to strike?

[name="Amiya"]   Reunion is no stranger to sneak attacks.
[name="Amiya"]   We learned this the hard way at Chernobog.
[name="Amiya"]   Let's fall back quickly...

[name="Liskarm"]   I can't guarantee the safety of the escape route.
[name="Liskarm"]   We'll be in danger if they start demolishing the nearby buildings to block the road.

[name="Liskarm"]   Amiya, how about taking that staircase to our 4 o'clock down?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1")]
[name="Franka"]   That's a difficult route.

[name="Misha"]   There are some Infected kids... still in the slums.
[name="Misha"]   If possible...

[name="Ch'en"]   Our duty is to protect Lungmen.

[name="Misha"]   I can't think of any reason why you'd want me.
[name="Misha"]   But I have a feeling...

[name="Misha"]   ...It's about my parents.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1", name2="char_012_misa_1", focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]   ...Yes.
[name="Ch'en"]   Your father was the most famous scientist in Chernobog.
[name="Ch'en"]   As well as one of the most important political figures there.
[name="Ch'en"]   Perhaps, there's something you might know...
[name="Ch'en"]   ...
[name="Ch'en"]   But even if that isn't the case...
[name="Ch'en"]   We cannot allow you to fall into Reunion's hands.
