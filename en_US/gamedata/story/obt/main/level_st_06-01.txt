[name="???"]  Eno, what's this book about?
[name="Eno"]  Ah, I read it. So I brought it for you.
[name="Eno"]  I think you'll like it, Sasha! It's a book about ideals.
[name="Sasha"]  Ideals?
[name="Eno"]  Yes.
[name="Sasha"]  What are your ideals, Eno?
[name="Eno"]  ...Ideals, huh.
[name="Eno"]  I don't know. Can I have ideals?
[name="Sasha"]  Of course you can! Why couldn't you?
[name="Eno"]  Ah, crap, it's time to go home...
[name="Sasha"]  You don't want to go?
[name="Eno"]  ...I don't want to go home.
[name="Sasha"]  But Eno, you said that if you didn't go home, your father would beat you...
[name="Sasha"]  But I'll see you tomorrow, right? I can still see you tomorrow.
[name="Eno"]  I know. I'll put the book and some bread in here.
[name="Eno"]  ...Sasha, I don't want to go. It's terrible. I'll get beaten even if I go back now.
[name="Sasha"]  ........
[name="Sasha"]  So come out tomorrow. If you get hit, you can hit me.
[name="Eno"]  Huh...? Hahaha, Sasha, did you get in another fight? Did they knock your head around?
[name="Eno"]  You have bruises, so many wounds.
[name="Sasha"]  This way, people know you're hurting. At least someone will know.
[name="Eno"]  Well, I know what you're thinking. But I won't.
[name="Sasha"]  If those kids are still picking on you, let me know! I'll take them all down!
[name="Eno"]  I know!
[name="Eno"]  See you tomorrow! I'll come and sing to you again!

I don't even know what happened to him.
All I know is that he gave me food.
I only know that he could read, and I wanted to read, and he taught me.
I only know that the other kids liked to bully him because he gave me bread and I was stronger, and I hit them and they hit me.
But I don't know what happened to him.

[name="Sasha"]  Come on, I'll bandage you up! There must be some cloth around here...!
[name="Eno"]  That man cut my leg.... Then with one breath, it's better.

[name="Sasha"]  ...Because all of your family are assholes. All of them.
[name="Eno"]  Yes!
[name="Eno"]  So the kids killed them.
[name="Sasha"]  ...What?
[name="Eno"]  The Infected kids who hadn't been driven out of town....

[name="Eno"]  They hit me, too. They hurt you too.
