[Character(name="char_106_franka_1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   My pleasure.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   However, Franka, your task was to launch a feint attack.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Instead, you fought your way all the way here. You have a huge target over your head now. Is that fine with you?

[Character(name="char_136_hsguma")]
[name="Hoshiguma"]   That probably won't last for much longer. The enemies have set up many obstacles, and are doing a good job of staying hidden.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Amiya, be prepared for a hard fight.
[name="Hoshiguma"]   Dr. {@nickname}, make sure you scout things out thoroughly and protect your squads!
