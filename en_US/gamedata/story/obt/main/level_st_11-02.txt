Golding knows that the visit from the commander means her identity is no longer a secret.
She wanders the streets aimlessly, filled with a deep feeling of helplessness.
Perhaps it was always futile for humans to fight the tide.
Adams's bookstore is open, but the familiar warm, yellow light is absent. Golding has a bad feeling.
The bookstore is empty, but the smell of blood fills every corner, so thick it might as well have taken physical form.
Golding realizes that the ground is sticky.
Not just the ground. The counter, the cashier, the books on the shelves, and the teapot that Adams always has by his side.
Everything has been painted a shade of light red.
Blood.

The nausea that has been bothering Golding for days explodes uncontrollably.
She runs out onto the streets and begins to vomit.
