[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  We can bring all those greedy countries to part with the lands they stole, and give the downtrodden the chance to regain their dignity under the glory of Ursus. We conquer not to annihilate, but to rebuild.
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  We gave this world a new lease of life.

[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  But I believe the Infected are a force that Ursus should've possessed in the first place.
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  All of you should strive to become a symbol of Ursus's glory. The Infected who oppose Ursus shall perish. As for all of you, if you are willing to take up arms for Ursus, it will be recognized as a glorious and noble deed.

Talulah can hear the men whispering around her; the murmurs have never been louder.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
[name="Patriot"]  Just because I don't oppose your theories doesn't mean that I agree with them. Such simplicity is a kind of arrogance.
[name="Patriot"]  Perhaps you've come to enjoy having this kind of authority? The kind of freewheeling authority that tells you everything you do is to build a better future? What gives you the right to brag about glory?  
[Character(name="avg_npc_077")]
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  In that case, if you are fighting for the minority, on what basis are you saying you deserve the majority's endorsement? What is so righteous about your fight for the Infected?  
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Surely you will be able to give me an intelligent answer, Wendigo.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
[name="Patriot"]  —What does justice even have to do with how many people you got?
[name="Patriot"]  Royal Guard, I will ask you just one question. How many people actually loved the Emperor in those days? Was that number high, or low?

[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
[name="Patriot"]  Because we know each other well.
[name="Patriot"]  Perhaps the road you described is indeed a yellow brick road, but I'm afraid I've already made my decision. I chose the Infected. 
[name="Patriot"]  A soldier serves his country and his beliefs, not its tyranny. That is why I will destroy this empire and ignite a war of righteousness. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_077")]
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  We, too, need the support of the Infected, and we are also fighting for a just cause.
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Why do you refuse us, then?
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Is it because you believe the path the 'Reunion' is taking you is better than the unity and reform we seek? Because it's more efficient? Or is it perhaps because it hurts the Ursus common folk less?  
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
[name="Patriot"]  No, it's simply because the war has already begun, and I need to see it through to the end. 
[name="Patriot"]  Even the Emperor I served, as benevolent and kind as he was, never accepted the Infected, and these promises are now nothing but lies to me.
[name="Patriot"]  If you could truly unite the Infected, then we wouldn't have a war.
[Character(name="avg_npc_077")]
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  It is our hope the Infected will unite under your lead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
[name="Patriot"]  If you actually wanted to unite them, you wouldn't need me.
[name="Patriot"]  Enough, Royal Guards.
[name="Patriot"]  I've already walked the path you are singing praises of, and that's why I don't believe there are any 'better choices' out there. If you tell me you had that kind of foresight, it just tells me you haven't yet faced the irony of fate. 
[name="Patriot"]  One day you will understand. Just like the twenty Royal Guards who died in the Valley of the Setting Sun. They were killed in the tundras and at the hands of foes of other races. It's much better than dying at the hands of your countrymen. 
[name="Patriot"]  Royal Guards, I am a traitor. I betrayed the Empire. There is no room for us to reconcile.

[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Even if they revere your might and your honesty, how will you assure them they are not just worshipping a powerful idol?
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Is an evil idol able to shelter them better, or is an idol who lets herself be trampled upon more preferable?
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_077")]

[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Perhaps they know not who Kashchey is, but they know what a duke is, and they know the duke's daughter will one day become the duchess.
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  The people around you are not like how you see them. Her strength will one day come to rival yours, she will be no less resourceful, and her cunning will be on another level. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_077")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
[name="Patriot"]  Just because one inherits the knowledge of corruption doesn't mean they too will fall to it. The footmarks she left on the tundras is proof that she won't meet the same fate as the old snake.

[name="Patriot"]  —Even if we find ourselves on the losing side.
[Character(name="avg_npc_077")]
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  ...Ah. Wendigo... I'm afraid I cannot spill any more secrets. 
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  Our warning isn't merely a rhetorical tool, Buldrokkas'tee.
[name="'Emperors' Blade'"]  We can only mourn for you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_025_1#3")]
