[name="Amiya"]  GreyThroat! What's your position?
[Character]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Amiya, I am providing support to an L. G. D. team.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  We're about to engage!
[name="Amiya"]  Attention all elite operators: this may be our first, last, and only large-scale battle in Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  Everyone take objective one as your primary mission.
[name="Amiya"]  My team and I will be focusing on engaging the enemy commander.
[name="Amiya"]  I want you all to remember: top priority is completing the terms of our contract, that is to work with the L. G. D. to ensure the security of Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  But Rhodes Island's mission in this battle is to reduce the friction between the Infected and uninfected people, to prevent clashes!
[name="Amiya"]  We are Rhodes Island! No matter what else we carry into battle!
[name="Amiya"]  No matter when, no matter where!
[name="Amiya"]  And of course, if at any point our operations fall outside our standards, we will put a stop to them at once!
[name="Amiya"]  As such, we go into battle with a heavy burden of responsibility on our shoulders.

[name="Swire"]  Weren't you leaving that to the special forces?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  No reason we can't take the opportunity.
[name="Ch'en"]  I've already looked into the situation once and one thing is clear: as long as we're there, the special forces can't act openly.
[name="Ch'en"]  Once the fighting stops, they won't be able to do much.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Swire"]  All right, so you've got it all figured out. What's going on in the slums?
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  My informants have been busy. There's a few sectors I haven't been able to contact, but we have a lot more intelligence than anyone else.
[Character(name="char_308_swire_1#5",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]

[name="Ch'en"]  The L. G. D. is the only group that can face down the special forces.

[name="Ch'en"]  I need to apologize for the whole ordeal with Reunion scooping up the Infected. That wouldn't have happened if we'd been more thoughtful.
[Character]
[name="Amiya"]  ...It's thanks to the L. G. D.'s quick action in the slums that Lungmen is able to plan against Reunion.
[name="Amiya"]  On a strategic level, I think you're fine, Officer Ch'en. But personally...
[name="Amiya"]  Officer Ch'en, Misha is dead.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  ......
[Character]
[name="Amiya"]  And I can't condone your opinions of the Infected. Even you know...
[name="Amiya"]  The Lungmenites who love their city will fight for her, no matter who they are.

[name="Swire"]  Hey!
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  I agree with you, Amiya. Fighting for Lungmen can unite the people... except those tied up with Reunion.
[name="Ch'en"]  But actually living in Lungmen is another matter. Time can't solve everything.
[Character]
[name="Amiya"]  Of course. We have to solve everything ourselves.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Wishful thinking. The Infected and uninfected live in different worlds.
[Character]
[name="Amiya"]  It's not wishful thinking, Officer Ch'en. It's thinking about Misha, and the countless other Infected who died just like her.
[name="Amiya"]  It was the gap between those two worlds that killed them. Are we going to let that divide define us? Are we not going to fight to bridge it?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1")]
[name="Ch'en"]  ......
[Character]
[name="Amiya"]  I hope you can understand, Officer Ch'en, why it is that the Infected and uninfected of Rhodes Island come together to fight for Lungmen.
[name="Amiya"]  They're here, Officer Ch'en.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Prepare for battle.
