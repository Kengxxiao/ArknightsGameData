The white-haired Draco keeps trudging on in the cold, endless snowfield. On her back, the Elafia girl trembles away, pausing only to take in deep breaths now and then.
Snow drops down from the Elafia's horns. As Talulah slogs along, the snow-covered trees behind her begin to burn alight in silence. She has unknowingly begun to set her path ablaze.
The snowfields before her eyes are vast and endless. On her back, Alina is the only warmth she can feel.
Talulah feels each and every beat of Alina's heart through her back, and they grow weaker and weaker by the moment.
She wants to scream. She wants to cry. She wants to squeeze everything she feels out of her lungs, as though it could erase all this from her body.
But Talulah stays silent the entire time.

She has no memories of anything after that.

She leaves behind only a trail of flames, and, with the exception of Alina, everything behind her is burned away in the inferno of her wake.
