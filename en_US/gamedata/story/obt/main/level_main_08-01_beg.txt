Hui-chieh:
The storm hasn't broken for days. The whole valley's snowed over.
The raspberry bushes still haven't budded. It's like spring'll never come.
We're trapped here, starving, dressed thin, and every silent day we pass waiting for the snow to melt drives us out of our minds.
You know, there's something about it all I find odd.
We've never once had a smooth time of it. Any better circumstances, and they'd go to shit fast the moment I get involved.
Maybe it really is like the Lungmenites say. I'm a bad omen. Nothing good comes of being around me.
Reminds me of something from a hell of a long time ago.
I've been thinking how I need to share my thoughts with you, in order to find peace.
