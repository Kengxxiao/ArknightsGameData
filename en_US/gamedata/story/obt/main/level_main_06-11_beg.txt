[Character(name="avg_npc_037")]
[name="Nesti"]  It'll be a river out there in the wilderness... a river of refugees.
[name="Nesti"]  There's Ursus and Lugmenites out there. Infected and ordinary folk alike. No matter what they came with, they're leaving empty-handed.
[name="Nesti"]  They thought there was a place that would take them. Now they know there's never anywhere they could've gone.
