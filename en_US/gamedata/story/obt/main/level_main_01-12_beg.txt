[name="???"]  Did you really think we'd let you just stroll out of Chernobog?
[name="???"]  Don't you think it's about time for someone to wake you from your daydream?
[Character(name="char_130_doberm_ex")]
[name="Dobermann"]   Our commmunications have been restored, and I've contact O.P.D. They'll be joining up with us shortly!
[name="Dobermann"]   But, this blasted...

[name="???"]  But, I know that person next to you.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  Is Reunion... going to continue fighting us?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7", name2="char_1504_cqbw", focus=2)]
[name="???"]  Hey, hey, don't be like that.
[name="???"]  I have no love for that she-dragon, Talulah. I'm not even cut out for this goaltending business. It's a pain to have to rush over here after a long day of work.
[name="???"]  So for the sake of future cooperation, why don't we exchange some pleasantries first?
[name="???"]  You may simply call me... W.
[name="W"]  I've waited a long time to see that person next to you.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]

[name="W"]  --Don't be so hasty. I have some information you might be interested in.
[name="W"]  Actually, we just met some rather slick fellows... Quite skilled, and dressed just like you guys.
[name="W"]  Though their camouflage might have been enough to fool Ursus, I saw right through their little trick~
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2", name2="char_1504_cqbw", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  Could they be from the recon team?
[name="Amiya"]  I'm glad... that they're safe...
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#2", name2="char_1504_cqbw", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  Little bunny, are you their leader?

[name="Amiya"]  ? !
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#1", name2="char_1504_cqbw", focus=2)]
[name="W"]  I'm quite curious, what charm do you hold over them... so that they'd give their lives so enthusiastically and unremorsefully for you?
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7", name2="char_1504_cqbw", focus=1)]
[name="Amiya"]  What... are you saying...?
[Character(name="char_1504_cqbw")]
[name="W"]  You heard me. None of them... will be returning to you.
[name="W"]  Hey, you...
[name="W"]  Are you really... worth sacrificing their lives over?
