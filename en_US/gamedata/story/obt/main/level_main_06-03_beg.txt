[name="Faust"]  Mephisto?
[name="Faust"]  What was that you just unleashed? Your... team is more riled up than before.
[name="Faust"]  They're... they're in pain.

[name="Mephisto"]  Oh, you can tell? The seeds I planted have finally bloomed.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Mephisto"]  Nothing to worry about, Faust. They won't hurt us.

[name="Faust"]  You're still catalyzing their infection?
[name="Faust"]  Mephisto... just stop. We have a chance to survive.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mephisto"]  I am the only one who can perform such Arts! And it is only through my Arts that we can escape!
[name="Mephisto"]  You saw with your own eyes. If we push through like this, the L. G. D. will kill us all long before we can reach the escape tunnel in the slums!
[name="Mephisto"]  Have you ever seen those weapons before? Nobody in Chernobog had weapons like that!
[name="Mephisto"]  This is their city, they know it far better than us! Where did they come from? Where do they disappear to?! There's no way we can take them on with this few of us!
[name="Mephisto"]  The Chernobog Ursus are too weak... Lungmen treats us like an army, but we're no army. We're just a group of like-minded individuals trying to survive!

[name="Faust"]  Mephisto!
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mephisto"]  If not, we can definitely crush our enemies with such strength!
[name="Mephisto"]  But even if they did turn against us, I can't blame them for doing what it takes to survive.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  FrostNova is no traitor. I told you. Look at the facts.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mephisto"]  Indeed... we all do what it takes to survive.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#2",focus=1)]

[name="Mephisto"]  I'm going to show the L. G. D. something much more terrifying than an army. Just wait until they see the flowers that bloom from my people.
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Faust"]  Mephisto?!
[Character(name="char_1508_Faust_1#1",name2="char_1507_Mephisto_1#5",focus=2)]
