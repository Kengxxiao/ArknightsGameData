[Character(name="avg_npc_089")]
[name="Seasoned Rhodes Island Operator"] Not too good. There's only a couple of devils left on the lower level...
[name="Seasoned Rhodes Island Operator"] But they're all battle-hardened mercenaries, and horrible at that. Give them a single screw, and they'd come up with a hundred ways to kill you with it.
[name="Seasoned Rhodes Island Operator"] In terms of combat ability, we're about even. In terms of numbers, we've only got half theirs.

[Character(name="avg_npc_089")]

[name="Tired Rhodes Island Operator"] ...It's gotten hotter and hotter up above. Ever since just now, the action up there's gotten a little scary... and, uh, well, how do I put it? Makes it a little hard to breathe.
[Character(name="avg_npc_089")]
[name="Seasoned Rhodes Island Operator"] I said distract yourself, not think about it all!
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Tired Rhodes Island Operator"] ...Amiya. Amiya's alright, isn't she? And that Lungmen officer. Uh, I only met her once... but when I think about how they're dealing with... with... uh, what was it?
