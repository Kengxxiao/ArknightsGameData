[name="Mephisto"]  Indeed. They don't know that Faust is following them. I received some information from one of his scouts.
[name="Mephisto"]  Rhodes Island is trapped around the perimeter of the city center.
[name="Mephisto"]  Insects as they might be, they still might take advantage of the confusion caused by the Catastrophe to make their escape.
[name="Mephisto"]  Given their understanding of the situation in Chernobog, they could potentially interfere with our plans.
[name="Mephisto"]  ... At least, getting rid of them won't do us any harm.
