[name="Hoshiguma"]  Hmm? Seems so. Its name was changed later.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I think this is where my home used to be...

[name="Ch'en"]  This was the estate that belonged to my biological father's clan. Looks like it's been renovated. So much time has passed that I barely recognize it anymore.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Did you live here before studying abroad in Victoria?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Even though I've heard that both you and Mister Wei were born to Yan aristocrats, it's really quite astonishing to see a mansion this big.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Aristocrats? They were, but I'm not.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But, your mansion here... How should I call it?

[name="Ch'en"]  I forgot to bring the key. Besides, Reunion also just opened a hole along the side wall. They might have caused some unexpected damage.

[name="Hoshiguma"]  Okay.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  If I remember correctly, you joined the L.G.D. right after you graduated from Victoria and returned to Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I was living in the dorms at the time.
[Character(name="char_136_hsguma",name2="char_010_chen_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  So, you never returned here after that.
