[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I asked them if the warehouse was rigged.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  If the entire warehouse is hooked up with explosives...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="char_136_hsguma",focus=2)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Nothing. Phal made his way here after he was ambushed. Reunion originally was set up around here.

[name="Ch'en"]  49. I've memorized the location.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Details are on the paper. The intel about Reunion's infiltration was not sent to the other leaders, but just to one party... There must be a reason behind it. You must look into it, the sooner the better.

[name="Ch'en"]  None of us did. Thanks to your bravery, we now have a chance to stop the enemy.

[name="Informant"]  Haha... *cough*... I never liked Lungmen, and Lungmen never liked me.
[name="Informant"]  But now, I've finally managed to do something for Lungmen. Not bad for a bum like me, right...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You're calling one of the Chung Shui Big Three a bum?

[name="Informant"]  ...Madam Ch'en, how's Madam Oni doing? Is she still working as Inspector?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  She is. She's been my partner for a long time.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Madam Ch'en, Madam Oni... is too honest and frank. No one in the gang... *cough*... dared to challenge her.
[name="Informant"]  But she is no match for those Lungmen moguls. Please keep an eye on her.
[name="Informant"]  Don't let anyone demean her. I won't let those stuck-up plutocrats insult her because of her background!
[name="Informant"]  This is the only favor I ask of you. Just one... *cough* *cough*...
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Don't worry about that. Hoshiguma is very strong. No one can hurt her.

[name="Informant"]  No matter how powerful, everyone has their limits.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  The entire L.G.D. stands with her.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Good, that's a relief. Madam Oni, Madam Ch'en, I have no regrets now.
[name="Informant"]  Madam Ch'en, are you still here?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  I am.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Am I a good person?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  A few years ago, a bit hard to say. But now you are, without a doubt. Lungmen is proud of having citizens like you.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Hahaha... *cough*... Haha... a pathetic Infected can be a good citizen?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Some people in Lungmen are indeed obsessed with Oripathy, but you'd be better off asking Lungmen directly.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  How do I do that? Will a city answer me?
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Heh. I will, on its behalf.
[name="Ch'en"]  And it says, 'I don't mind.'
[name="Ch'en"]  Phal, you have always been - and always will be - one of Lungmen's best.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]
[name="Informant"]  Thank you, Madam Ch'en. Thank you so much.
[name="Informant"]  Madam Chen, there are two things I'd like you to relay to Madam Oni.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=1)]
[name="Ch'en"]  You should tell her yourself.
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#1",name2="avg_npc_013",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_013")]

[name="Informant"]  Well damn, haha... I've already used up my luck to have you carry me on your back, Boss.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Anywhere you want to go? You always refused to tell me where you came from.
[name="Informant"]  Here, Lungmen. As a matter of fact, I've never been to other cities. If possible, just bury me in that old place.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  The hideout? But... that place is a complete wreck now, long deserted. To be honest, I'm not sure how I'd clean it up.
[name="Informant"]  It's okay. As long as I'm... with the others.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I will.
[name="Informant"]  Boss... Even though we've always been scared of you, we've also always... cheered you on.
[name="Informant"]  We've always... cheered...
