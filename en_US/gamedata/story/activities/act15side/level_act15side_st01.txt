Along Yingfeng Road in Shangshu of Great Yan, sits an inn.
Not many establishments would call themselves an inn in modern Yan.
But this one has the most antique atmosphere, the finest wine and tea, and is the most cultured in all Shangshu.
Its sign is red with gold lettering.
'Xingyu.'

[name="Mr. Nothing"]  You might be unaware, benefactor, but Yan has multiple bureaus of tianshi, Celestial Masters. Any student of the land even a mite accomplished at Originium Arts may apply to join, take layer upon layer of examination, and so serve the country.

[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Originium Arts have a dizzying array of applications, and the science of Originium is developing by the day. The tianshi of Yan are naturally classified by profession and specialty—civil engineers, for example! The artists of earth and wood indeed.

[name="Kroos"]  Phew—now that's refreshing.
[name="Kroos"]  'Where the winds blow high, and the clouds part to show off the moon.' I can see how it earned that.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Within Shangshu lie the renowned 'Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks,' and they draw plenty of tourists. Some foreign nobility even make the trip out here simply to admire them.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Presumably the common folk owe it only to the pains of crossing the land that these landmarks aren't swarmed by such visitors coming in droves.
[name="Kroos"]  There's a comfy breeze up here. I was worried it'd rain and delay us from heading up the mountains today.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Quite right, benefactor. The spring breeze caresses one's cheeks, the drizzle falls finely, all silent and slick in the rain.
[name="Kroos"]  Been meaning to ask, actually. You're a martial artist, right? So how'd you get so... bookish?
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  My master often instructed us that practicing the martial arts hardly precludes the study of culture. Indeed, the arts come both martial and cultural. To learn them well is but the duty of the modern soul.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Besides, the art of gab can be a gateway to making some money.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]  Benefactor, what say we visit the nearest summit on the way? I hear more people have taken to the mountains these last two years; there's been quite the hubbub.

[name="Kroos"]  *Sigh* Never felt so bad about missing all the scenery on the way though.
