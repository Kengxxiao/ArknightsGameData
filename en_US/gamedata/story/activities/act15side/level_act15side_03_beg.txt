[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  This isn't it...
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  If things were really so simple, then I would find myself worried about Mr. Liang's eye for talent.
[name="Zuo Le"]  Mr. Zheng, do we know anything about the visitor from Lungmen yet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  He's an old friend of Liang Xun's.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Anything special about him?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  We have a few unclear leads, but I can at least guarantee that this affair has nothing to do with Lord Wei.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  That's my father's greatest worry taken care of.
[name="Zuo Le"]  True though, considering the sort of methods that Lord Wei of Lungmen usually employs... If he were involved, we wouldn't be sitting here enjoying tea right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  I've heard many anecdotes about him over the years. It's a shame that I've never had the chance to visit Lungmen to see his exploits with my own eyes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  I'm surprised that you'd show such a keen interest in someone like him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  I walked the world of kung fu in my younger years, and I've heard he's fine swordsman. That's all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#7$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  I see. It's true that he's a swordsman... As for his swordsmanship, though, all I know is rumors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  In any case, can we assume it was Mr. Liang himself who chose to involve the Lungmenite?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Undoubtedly.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Hm... He is the only remaining variable, and also Mr. Liang's only trump card.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Mr. Liang should've been on our side. The man he chose should not have tried to deceive me either. It was an illogical move.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#2$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Mr. Liang doesn't have much of a choice himself. If only... *Sigh*... No, it wouldn't have mattered.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Isn't her presence in Shangshu the reason everything has gotten so out of hand?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  The Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks... A place graced by the presence of a deity.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  In eras past, Shangshu was a place where many dreamed. Not only people but all inanimate things. As the saying goes, all things in the world can be deified with souls, and all words in the realm can be summarized in a sigh.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  According to legend, a millennium ago the Yanese towns were scattered all over the country. It was only when our Shangshu forebears all collectively saw the same dream that they chose to settle down on these lands.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  The legends of Shangshu have always been so magnificent.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Outsiders may see it as mere legend, but to the locals it is history.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  The Operator from the medical company... Kroos, was it?
[name="Zuo Le"]  If it wasn't for your help, she would likely have caught up to me. You have my thanks, Mr. Zheng.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  You once saved my daughter from having her hotheadedness lead to disaster. It is only natural for me to come to your aid.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  At the end of the day, Rhodes Island is an unknown. What do you think, Innkeeper?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  They are not a part of the game.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  They are nonetheless standing very close to the table.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#6$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Hmm... I rarely see young a woman with such fine techniques, though. Seeing her chase after you gave me a good idea of her abilities. 
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  And what's your assessment?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  She may be young, but she's a battle-hardened veteran.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Hoh? Did you arrive at that conclusion as Zheng the Innkeeper or Zheng Qingyue, the Asker to the Frost?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#4$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Both.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  You haven't once looked away from that fake cup.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  I'm only reminiscing... reminiscing about the goblet's original form.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  When we crossed that wilderness all those years ago... we ran into a group of bandits. None of them spoke Yanese, and we hadn't the slightest idea where they came from.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  They blew up the caravan and tried to steal our wares, though our Escort Association colleagues stopped them. Still, there were far too many, all obsessed with our wares, and they followed us for two hundred li.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  It was raining. Visibility was low, and there was nary a light in sight. The bandits, who knew the terrain much better, followed us like shadows.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  We were afraid to counterattack, lest they have some kind of underhanded trick up their sleeves. We were too afraid to run either, lest we couldn't shake them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  From what I heard, the Sui Regulator once secretly commissioned the renowned Xingyu Escort Association to transport an item, only for it to be lost in an accident en route.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  That was my fault.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  I'm afraid I'm not very good with comforting words, Mr. Zheng.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  I simply never expected that the next time I met a crossbowman of such horrifying prowess would be in my hometown, in the dead center of the city, under a well-lit night, all for the same goblet.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  I truly... cannot begin to explain how I feel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  How did you escape then, Mr Zheng?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  When do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Oh... The incident you were just talking about, of course. My father always tells me that I am still young and inexperienced, and should learn from my elders.
[name="Zuo Le"]  If you would continue to share your story with me, I'll gladly listen.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Luck was on my side that night...
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Two of my men were hurt. Good men. Neither of them made it.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  The Association's rule is to 'save the goods, then the men.' We all knew the risks when we joined the business.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  But with the injured dead and the goods threatened, that actually freed us to do as we pleased.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  It was pouring that night. Helped to wash the blood off our blades.

[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Correct.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  By owner, you mean a buyer or collector?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Not quite. It would be a much simpler matter if that were the case.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Hm, that's strange. This cup was shockingly cheap, but according to the black market appraisal I stole from the smugglers, it seems...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  It's an actual antique, through and through.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  	Who's the man of the hour then?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  I don't know their name... Nor anything else, really. Their gender, their race, their age...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Well... Where am I supposed to start then...? Are you even sure they're in Shangshu?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  That much is certain, and only that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  How do you know? Suppose our friend decides to take a trip, wouldn't that make this a huge waste of time?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  No, they are in Shangshu. I can guarantee you that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  If they had left Shangshu... I would have been notified.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Strange. So you can monitor them, but you can't locate them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  That's right...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Are they some kind of monster or enlightened deity?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  You'll know what I mean once you see them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  So they must leave some kind of indication that they're here... Is this the kind of funny business government officials have to deal with these days?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Fine, I won't probe any further if you don't want to tell me. It's just, that's not much of a lead in a town this big...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  They're most likely hiding in one of the Three Mounts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  How do you figure?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Our friend is unpredictable, but every once in a while they show up at the mountainside liquor shops to buy alcohol, with no regularity whatsoever.
[name="Liang Xun"]  But they've never come down to the valleys, nor have they ever appeared in the nomadic cities. In which case, they're most likely somewhere in the mountains.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Very well, then. The Three Mounts and Seventeen Peaks it is. Sounds like a fun trip.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Legend has it that our friend is an appreciator of fine weather and scenery. And they enjoy lounging in pavilions and writing poetry all the more.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Legend, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  It is more than mere legend, actually...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  So you're familiar with them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Not exactly.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  In the end, you may just have to try your luck, troublesome as it sounds.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Do we have a deadline?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#7$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  I'd appreciate it if you'd take care of this as soon as possible. As you can tell, a few too many people are already mixed up in this affair. The longer it continues, the greater the chance it will get even more out of hand.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  As for the cup... Seeing as someone has their eyes on it, we should keep it in the safety of my estate.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Amazing, Mr. Liang. First you had me bring it to you across thousands of li, then you want me to find its owner, and now you won't even let me hold it?
[name="Lee"]  You're really putting me in quite a bind. Perhaps next time you'll arrange for me to help you from the comfort of Lungmen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  This is a sign of my trust in you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#2$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  It's true though that if someone has their eyes on it, then keeping it on my person is asking for trouble.
[name="Lee"]  As for the Xingyu Inn...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  We're investigating it. Be careful on your way. If you need help, I can arrange for someone to accompany you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  No need. A bodyguard tagging along would just make me stand out. It's trouble, and you know it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  Are you certain you'll be fine on your own, though...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Sure, as long as you aren't hiding anything else from me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#10$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  I'm looking for someone, not investigating a scary smuggler ring in Lungmen. How much trouble can it be?
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#10$1",focus=1)]
[name="Liang Xun"]  At least talk to Master Shen. As a veteran boatman, he can help you get anywhere in Shangshu.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Very well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lee"]  Incidentally...
[Character(name="avg_npc_295_1#1$1",name2="avg_322_lmlee_1#8$1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  She may be my daughter, but I'm ashamed to say she is still very immature.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  No, she's your family. I am in no position to meddle in your household affairs.
[name="Zuo Le"]  How many inns and restaurants have you opened here in your town?
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Hohoh... I've spent my entire my life savings on this business. Fortunately, my old pals take care of me these days. The connections I made over the years finally came in handy.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  *Sigh*... While it takes connections to survive in this business, of course, in the end it's all down to how capable you are. Being a businessman is another thing entirely. It takes skills to start a business, but connections to build it up.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  No doubt you are already well aware of that though.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Not at all. My father always tells me what youngsters like me lack isn't persistence or conviction. It's an understanding of everything that surrounds us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Wise words. Indeed, being holed up in a castle in the clouds is no way to live.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Still, General Zuo is a good father, but it doesn't matter what your father thinks. What is truly important is... what you think.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  Don't worry about that too much. When you are young, there is no shame in letting your frustration, curiosity, or anger get the better of you.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  On the contrary, young man, you don't want to lose your edge too early.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Zuo Le"]  Thank you for your advice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_297_1#1$1",name2="avg_npc_300_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  *Sigh*... My advice wasn't just for you. It may sound simple, but it is no simple matter. I had to hear it for myself, all the same.
[name="Innkeeper Zheng"]  My daughter... What a headache she is.

[name="Kroos"]  Yanese is a tricky language, and I can't say I've had time to master it, but wouldn't you say using the phrase 'take back' here is a little too convenient?
[name="Kroos"]  I trust Mr. Lee. If you really had a grievance, or if this were all a misunderstanding, did it really have to come to blows?
[name="Kroos"]  This is the Yanese heartland, not Siracusa or Bolívar... violence won't get you anywhere.
