[name="Andoain"]But what did this place offer him? How did the glorious Lateran City treat this foreigner who had long been a toy of fate's cruelty?
[name="Andoain"]See the Caprinae woman watering the herbs? She was branded a whore and a blasphemer for offending a noble, only barely escaping her home when it was set alight.
[name="Andoain"]All she wanted was peace and quiet, or, if fate would allow her a bit of luxury, a brief moment of leisure and joy every now and then. Do you think the saints in the Basilica will think her their sister?

[name="Andoain"]As for the Sarkaz, the 'cursed devils,' the 'crafty devils...' The 'devils' have never had a choice.
[name="Andoain"]Our hatred of them has lasted thousands of years. For as long as history books go back, the Sankta and the Sarkaz have been slaughtering one another. The origin of this conflict is long gone. Our mutual hatred has become common sense.
[name="Andoain"]Father and son slay father and son. Sisters murder sisters. The Sarkaz attack Sankta caravans for sport, while the Sankta shoot their Sarkaz enemies through the chest with greatest pride.
[name="Andoain"]We are only ever concerned with how we see them, yet we are never interested in how they see us. Vengeance for vengeance grew into custom, and those customs eventually became tradition.
[name="Andoain"]But, if you are willing to spend the night with them under the same roof, you will find that their joys and sorrows are no different from ours.
[name="Andoain"]They rejoice when reunited, they weep when one passes, they tease their friends, and they grow bashful when they fall in love. Some of them love drink, others love song. Some of them even choose to dedicate their lives to their faith.
[name="Andoain"]How are they any different from us?
[name="Andoain"]In Laterano, even the most devout Liberi friars who carefully follow the Church's teachings, who dutifully carry out their tasks in each ceremony, even those who are made saints and created cardinals...
[name="Andoain"]The Church has never truly accepted them. The Liberi are only there to lend a helping hand. They are tools to be used in the Church's day-to-day affairs.
[name="Andoain"]They don't have halos, which means they... heh, they aren't 'chosen,' they aren't Sankta.
