Lemuen gazes out the window as Mostima stands beside it, idly playing with the flowers in her hands.
In a flash, Fiammetta returns to a time before.
The sun shines ever bright and beautiful during a Lateran springtime, and a hint of chill rides the air.
Through the window, she spots the roofs of church buildings large and small. Here and there, now and then, fowlbeasts streak across the sky.
Lemuen is peaceful in any ordinary time, occasionally uttering a remark or two. Around her, the atmosphere softens.
The standoffish Mostima relaxes without realizing, unable to sense the smile she lets slip.
......
Just as always.
As if none of it ever happened.
