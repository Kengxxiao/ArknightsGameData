[name="Reserved Hospital Attendant"]Come with me. She's got somewhat special circumstances, and the doctor said he needs to talk with you in private.

[name="Ezell"]There was a strong gust of wind just now. I'll close the window, in case she'd catch a cold.

[name="Reserved Hospital Attendant"]Hm? Of course.

[character(name="avg_npc_365_1#1$1")]
[name="Reserved Hospital Attendant"]Well... we can't be exactly sure yet. We'll need to wait for the diagnosis. The doctor will be here shortly. Just hold on, and we'll see what he has to say.

[name="Reserved Hospital Attendant"]So you suckered me... I only needed to keep you here for a short while anyway. If I were you, I wouldn't be giving myself trouble.
[name="Reserved Hospital Attendant"]Patia said to be more gentle with Cecelia... but not with you.
