[name="Occphen"]That's the stuff of sci-fi novels.
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]There are Arts that can heal wounds, but they're a very difficult type of Arts to master.
[name="Miarow"]Before you can master healing Arts, you first have to have a complete understanding of medical science, you have to know the anatomical structures of all the different races, things like that...
[name="Miarow"]Also, most healing Arts users can only stop bleeding or speed up wound recovery.
[name="Miarow"]These Arts are very useful on the operating table, but in my experience they're no substitute for real medical skill.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]Doctor, can you use Arts?
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]I have a little knowledge... not very useful though.
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#1")]
[name="Blitz"]That's boringly realistic... *sigh*.
[name="Blitz"]To think a world with magic could be so inconvenient.
[name="Blitz"]Hold up, did you just say 'sci-fi novels'?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3")]
[name="Blitz"]Now I'm extra curious what your world's sci-fi novels talk about.
[name="Blitz"]Would we find a bookstore in a bigger city? Maybe some history books too? Are books expensive?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#2")]
[name="Blitz"]I've gotten myself all worked up now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]You're a weird bunch.
[name="Occphen"]Where are you from anyway? Columbia? Victoria?
[name="Occphen"]You talk like you're Victorians, but like from a couple decades ago...
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3")]
[name="Blitz"]Well... I'm not really sure how to answer that one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]Miss Cohen and her friends came from very far away. From a place where Oripathy doesn't even exist.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]What??
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]...Yeah, that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]A country with no Oripathy? Really?
[name="Occphen"]No Oripathy, no Infected, that means no discrimination? A place with no hatred, where everyone's equal?
[name="Occphen"]Lordy loo. What kind of paradise is that?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#1")]
[name="Blitz"]......
[Character(name="char_458_rfrost_1#1")]
[name="Frost"]......
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#8")]
[name="Ash"]*Sigh*...
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]...Alright then. Your faces say it all. Just pretend I never asked...
