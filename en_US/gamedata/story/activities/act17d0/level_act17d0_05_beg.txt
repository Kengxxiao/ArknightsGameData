[character(name="char_459_tachak_1",name2="char_503_rang",focus=2)]
[name="Rangers"]It's a pretty ordinary crossbow. Most Sarkaz can lock it barehanded.

[name="Tachanka"]A heavy crossbow with this kind of power... at least than one hundred meters, it won't be that different from a gun. It's just too much work.

[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Tachanka"]We're expecting a lot of fights soon, so it's time to think about what to do when we run out of ammo.
[name="Tachanka"]Without bullets, my gun might as well be a paperweight.
[name="Tachanka"]I don't think we can take them hand-to-hand when it comes to that. And our training and experience won't be enough either.

[name="Ash"]How much do we have left?
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Tachanka"]Not much over here. Not even four hundred rounds.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ash"]Let me show you something.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Tachanka"]Is this a... bullet?
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ash"]It's a bullet that Rhodes Islander named Liskarm uses. They call it an 'etched bullet,' and it's apparently an extremely expensive commodity.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Tachanka"]Did you take it apart yet?
[name="Tachanka"]What's it made of? What's the propellant?
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ash"]This chunk of crystal.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=2)]
[name="Tachanka"]Looks like an energy source. Is that a propellant or a warhead?
[character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]A Laterano gunsmith once told me that every single etched bullet contains a miniature casting unit that matches up with the structure of a Laterano gun.
[name="Rangers"]That means it's not only the gun, but every etched bullet, is basically a caster's staff. That's why they're so expensive, and why they need such complicated Arts that only Sankta can make much use of them.
[name="Rangers"]Other peoples go with easier ranged weapons.
[character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]So Laterano is the name of the country, Sankta is the name of the race. Laterano people are not necessarily Sankta... Got it.
[name="Tachanka"]But that's real bad news about the bullets.
[name="Tachanka"]Do we have any gun here that doesn't require those 'Originium Arts' to work?
[character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]I've never heard about those firearms that don't need Originium Arts.

[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=1)]

[character(name="avg_npc_156_1#1",name2="char_457_blitz_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Liskarm"]I installed a high-powered spotlight and a universal Originium circuit based on the original design and function of your shield. It should work just like you're used to.
[character(name="avg_npc_156_1#1",name2="char_457_blitz_1#2",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_155_1#2",name2="avg_npc_156_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]Strictly speaking, a universal Originium circuit is a piece of modern technology that lets people who don't know how to use Arts use it anyway. It is loaded with a few simple Originium Arts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_155_1#2",name2="avg_npc_156_1#1",focus=2)]
