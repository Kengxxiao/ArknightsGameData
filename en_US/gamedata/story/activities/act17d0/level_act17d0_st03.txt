[name="Picale"]Thank you for all you've done, Cohen, Kötz, Tina, Alexsandr.
[name="Picale"]On behalf of... The town of Long Spring...
[name="Picale"]Sorry, I'm not so good with this kind of formal language.
[name="Picale"]Thanks to you, I survived the conflict with my brother, and my people were able to return to live on their land.
[name="Picale"]Thank you.
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]We were only doing what had to be done.
[name="Ash"]We started this, so it's our responsibility to end it.
[character(name="avg_npc_159_1#1")]
[name="Picale"]If it weren't for my irredeemable brother, none of this would've happened.
[name="Picale"]I would have liked to offer you a reward.
[name="Picale"]But, as you can see, our town has been destroyed.
[name="Picale"]Anything we have left, I want used to rebuild Long Spring.
[name="Picale"]A cash reward... is beyond my power to give you.
[character(name="avg_npc_159_1#3")]
[name="Picale"]But anything you may want from this home is yours to take.
[name="Picale"]I think we will have to tear it all down and build a new Long Spring with the survivors.
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]About that.
[name="Ash"]Alexsandr?
[Character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]This helmet fits well. Can I keep it?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#6",name2="char_458_rfrost_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Frost"]Uh huh.
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#5",name2="char_458_rfrost_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Blitz"]Really, the nail tips are so blindingly bright, I'd like to put one on my shield so I don't need batteries anymore.
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]That's enough for us. We're satisfied.
[character(name="avg_npc_159_1#1")]
[name="Picale"]That's... that's all?
[name="Picale"]My weapons, my father's heirlooms, you can—
[Character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]No thanks. You need them more than we do.
[character(name="avg_npc_159_1#1")]
[name="Picale"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_159_1#3")]
[name="Picale"]Thank you.

[character(name="avg_npc_167",name2="char_456_ash_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ash"]Right. We've been fighting too long. We need a place to rest and resupply.
[name="Ash"]And most importantly, we probably need some identities.
[name="Ash"]Identities we can go around the world with... around Terra.
[character(name="avg_npc_167",name2="char_456_ash_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Stormeye"]Sure.
[character(name="avg_npc_167")]

[name="Human Resources Operator"]That's about it. Is there anything else you'd like to know?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#5")]

[name="Frost"]Do we have a plan?

[name="Ash"]I'd like to have a detailed writeup myself.
[name="Ash"]But this time, I'm sorry.
[name="Ash"]It's all up to us.
[name="Blitz"]So where's our first destination?
[name="Ash"]Somewhere called Siesta. Sounds like a pretty good city.
[name="Tachanka"]Then let's get going.
[name="Tachanka"]Until we make it back home, we're on the road.
