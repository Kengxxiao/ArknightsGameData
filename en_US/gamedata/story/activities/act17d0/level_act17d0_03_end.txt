[character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]But isn't it an incurable disease?
[character(name="avg_npc_160_1#3")]
[name="Miarow"]Yes...
[name="Miarow"]Actually, there used to be a lot of people who claimed to be able to cure Oripathy.
[name="Miarow"]They were mostly shysters who ended up ruined when their scams were exposed.
[name="Miarow"]As for those who just exaggerated the effectiveness of their drugs suppressing the symptoms of Oripathy, they might not reach the level of fraud yet, but even their suppressant drugs are very expensive.
[character(name="char_459_tachak_1")]
[name="Tachanka"]I'd guess so.
[character(name="avg_npc_160_1#1",name2="char_459_tachak_1",focus=1)]
[name="Miarow"]I once heard about a lord whose daughter contracted Oripathy, and he spent a lot of money to buy the suppressants from Columbia to save his daughter.

[name="Miarow"]This is the safehouse's store of Oripathy suppressants.
[name="Miarow"]These past few days, I injected some of the more serious sufferers with this, and it really did suppress their symptoms. It works better than any drug I've ever seen before.
[name="Miarow"]This medicine... must be insanely expensive, no?
[name="Miarow"]But Mr. Occphen wasn't concerned with that at all. When I told him some of my patients were in critical condition, he gave me the box.
[name="Miarow"]It's not that I don't believe there are good people in this world, but...
[character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3")]

[character(name="avg_npc_166")]
[name="Schwarz"]Sarkaz Mercenary...
[name="Schwarz"]Controlling the monsters, should be casters.
[name="Schwarz"]They're organized, disciplined, and most importantly, they know when to cut their losses and back down. They're not here for a quick raid.
[Character(name="avg_npc_155_1#1")]
[name="Franka"]They are all properly geared up with Columbian equipment. Some of them were extremely tough back when they sieged the safe house.
[character(name="avg_npc_166")]
[name="Schwarz"]Judging from the equipments and tactics, they should be professional mercenaries who signed the 'Redmark contract.'
[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]I'm afraid it's a rebellion against the local lord.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]But why are they attacking civilians?
[name="Ash"]They chased us here from the Infected quarter.
[name="Ash"]What on Earth do these mercs actually want?
[Character(name="avg_npc_156_1#1")]
[name="Liskarm"]The most likely answer is they wanted to silence you.
[character(name="char_457_blitz_1#1")]
[name="Blitz"]I'm afraid that's not the only thing they were after.
[Character(name="avg_npc_156_1#1")]
[name="Liskarm"]What do you mean?
[character(name="char_457_blitz_1#1")]
[name="Blitz"]When they attacked the Infected quarter yesterday, they were obviously targeting the sick.
[name="Blitz"]They were trying to round them up.
[name="Blitz"]I'm pretty sure that was their goal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_155_1#1")]
[name="Franka"]Kidnapping... Infected?
[name="Franka"]That doesn't make any sense.
[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]The enemy's objectives are a mystery to us, but that's not the most important thing.
[name="Rangers"]For now, the best thing we can do is wait.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#7")]
[name="Ash"]Wait?
[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]You may not realize it, but we're standing in the middle of a fait accompli.
[name="Rangers"]We walked into this Lord Ameer's territory without his permission, violating his commandments and the local laws. We've broken a major Sargon taboo.
[name="Rangers"]The town nobility may be in the middle of a war, but they're still the rulers here.
[name="Rangers"]Sticking our noses in anything else at this point would only make our situation even worse.
[name="Rangers"]The local lord set up an Infected quarter. That tells us he's not totally cruel and heartless.
[name="Rangers"]He was willing to let Rhodes Island build a safehouse here. That means he's not an isolationist.
[name="Rangers"]I think he'll treat us fairly.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#6")]
[name="Ash"]National law... local government... I get it. That's the best we can hope for right now.
[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]Until the situation changes again, we'll hold out in the safehouse and wait for the riots to die down.
[name="Rangers"]I hope you can help us.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#5")]
[name="Ash"]No problem. We need Rhodes Island's professional expertise too.
[Character(name="char_503_rang")]
[name="Rangers"]All right then. I'm looking forward to working with the four of you.
