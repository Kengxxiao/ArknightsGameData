[name="Occphen"]This is......Rhodes Island's branch office. I'm actually just a simple watchman.
[character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3")]
[name="Blitz"]Let me guess, those thugs came here and forced you to open the basement door, but you persisted in your duty and kept playing dumb, which resulted in you getting beaten up and left here to die?
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]......Something like that.
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#3",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Occphen"]Wait, how did you know there's a basement?
[Character(name="char_457_blitz_1#2",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Blitz"]You've been tricked. We're actually the thugs' backup, here to get you to confess everything.

[name="Occphen"]You......What are you actually planning to do?

[name="Miarow"]Don't worry, they're good people. They've been protecting the inhabitants of the infected zone all this while.
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#4", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Occphen"]The infected zone was attacked as well? ?
[name="Occphen"]This......It's messed up.
[name="Occphen"]What about the lord's soldiers? Where are Lord Tulla's soldiers?
[Character(name="avg_npc_160_1#1", name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Miarow"]The lord's soldiers still haven't appeared. They might be in trouble as well.

[name="Ash"]Mister Watchman, we need your help.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]But, what can I do to help? I can't even stand up right now.
[character(name="char_456_ash_1#2")]
[name="Ash"]The Infected townsfolk have also been attacked, with many of them being injured and the buildings of the infected zone suffering heavy damages.
[name="Ash"]We need you to open up the safe house and let them hide in here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Occphen"]That...

[name="Occphen"]But, but I...
[name="Occphen"]Based on the contract I signed with Rhodes Island, the entire safe house is the property of Rhodes Island.
[name="Occphen"]......I don't have the authority......
[name="Occphen"]......
[name="Occphen"]......Ugh......Infected......
[name="Occphen"]Alright, let them come. Losing my job is better than losing my life.
