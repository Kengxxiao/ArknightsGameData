[name="Utage"]  Here's your bag. And Tomimi, I think I saw her running off somewhere right before we won the fight.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1")]
[name="Gavial"]  Thanks. She didn't get scared, did she? Anyway, let's patch ourselves up first.
[name="Gavial"]  You go check if anyone's injured, and bring them to me if they are. I'll take care of them.
