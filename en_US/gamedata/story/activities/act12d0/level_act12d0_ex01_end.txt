Alty looks at the 'key' in her hand.

[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock",name2="npc_2004_Alty_rock",focus=2)]
[name="Alty"]  Knowledge.
[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock",name2="npc_2004_Alty_rock",focus=1)]

[Character(name="npc_2004_Alty_rock")]

[name="Inam"]  They're gone?
[name="Inam"]  There's a note on the table. Let's see...
[name="Inam"]  'We left. Don't miss us. I hope you enjoyed the music. Also, we left all our records here for you. Have fun.  -AUS'
[name="Inam"]  ...Heh, they really are unbelievable.

[name="Alty"]  I don't think I'll ever forget that Acahualla place.
[Character(name="npc_2003_Frost_rock")]
[name="Frost"]  (Humming) It was definitely unforgettable. 
[Character(name="npc_2001_Aya_rock")]
[name="Aya"]  But the people there are really noisy, and wild.
[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock")]
[name="Dan"]  Yeah? I love them!
[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock",name2="npc_2001_Aya_rock",focus=2)]
[name="Aya"]  Of course you do. I don't think you'd mind if we left you there.
[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock",name2="npc_2001_Aya_rock",focus=1)]
[name="Dan"]  I was definitely thinking about it.
[name="Dan"]  Don't you think those people have a kind of natural, primal energy?
[name="Dan"]  Out of all the countries and cities we've been to, I've never seen people like that.
[name="Dan"]  I love 'em!
[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock",name2="npc_2001_Aya_rock",focus=2)]
[name="Aya"]  Well, you're right about that much.
[Character(name="npc_2003_Frost_rock")]
[name="Frost"]  They really get our music. They're the best audience we've ever had.
[Character(name="npc_2004_Alty_rock")]
[name="Alty"]  I think Frost likes them too.
[name="Alty"]  But we can't just show up and flip a whole civilization upside-down. We should stick to singing.
[Character(name="npc_2001_Aya_rock")]
[name="Aya"]  Sing for them. If it sounds good—
[Character(name="npc_2002_Dan_rock")]
[name="Dan"]  Then they'll sing too.
[Character(name="npc_2001_Aya_rock")]
[name="Aya"]  Didn't we say that before?
[Character(name="npc_2004_Alty_rock")]
[name="Alty"]  Who knows? We might've said it a million times already.
[name="Alty"]  Let's go. Continue on our journey.
[name="Alty"]  If we sing to the world, will she listen?

A few of the bandmates joke around for a bit, until the car goes silent.
Alty looks at the key in her hand, 'Dr. Kal'tsit, can that Rhodes Island of yours give the world the answer it's looking for?'
