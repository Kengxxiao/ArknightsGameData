[name="Lancet-2"]  I like to think I'm ready for it, but it still hurts my heart a little whenever I get that sort of reaction. Not that I technically have a heart...
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Aircraft won't explode now, right?
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  It won't, but it's not exactly ideal to just leave it here...
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Yeah, true. I don't want Kal'tsit giving me the death stare either.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  I-If I send, um, some of my people out to take it back to my tribe, would that help?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Your tribe? Huh? Hell, I didn't realize. So our little girl's a full-grown clan leader now, huh?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Yes! It actually used to be your tribe, Gavial.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Well, damn. No wonder I recognized a couple of faces...
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Oh, also! Gavial, we changed the tribe's name now! 'Wilderness's Will' is now 'Gavial's Will'!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Hah?
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=2)]
[name="Tomimi"]  Because we all think you're the best, Gavial!
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  Uh—*cough* *cough*—okay, whatever. I'll leave you to it.

[name="Lancet-2"]  Ah, in that case, I think Mr. Dylan and I will stay with the aircraft.
[name="Lancet-2"]  I understand you're going to meet a large number of people. I would only cause problems if I went.
[name="Lancet-2"]  And the aircraft does need guarding.

[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Lancet-2"]  Don't worry about it. I prefer the quieter side of things, anyway.
[Character(name="char_285_medic2_1", name2="char_187_ccheal_1", focus=2)]
[name="Gavial"]  Suit yourself. I guess it'll be just me, the Doctor, and, uh, Kay going, then.

[name="Gavial"]  Oh! Shit! I forgot to warn you! There's a hell of a lot of mushrooms and fruits growing wild along the road here, and more than most of them you can't eat. If you do, you end up like that.
[name="Gavial"]  Forgot the kid was even wilder than me. I bet she snuck off while we were busy talking and helped herself to the buffet.
[name="Gavial"]  Uh, damn it. Okay. Go tie her up and take her back with you, Lancet-2. She'll be fine after a while, probably.

[name="Gavial"]  Oh, nice catch. Doctor, Tomimi, you two make sure you grab what you need from the aircraft.
[name="Gavial"]  It's a long way to the Temple from here, and the rainforest won't have anywhere decent to sleep. Get ready to spend the night in the open.
