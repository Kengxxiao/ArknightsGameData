[name="Tomimi"]  But some stuff happened with Gavial and we never chose a Great Chief. And ever since Gavial left, none of the tribes have really gotten along with each other.

[name="Tomimi"]  The rainforest Tiacauh don't live quite the same as the rest of us. They're a lot more scattered. Normally, they don't even communicate with us.
[name="Tomimi"]  But because we have no Great Chief, a lot of tribes ended up going into the rainforest.
