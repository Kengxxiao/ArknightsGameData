[name="Archosauria A"]  This weirdo's way too strong! She's beaten back so many of us already!
[name="Archosauria B"]  I still don't get what she's saying, but she's no joke!
[name="Archosauria C"]  I reckon she'd make a fine Great Chief!

[name="Tomimi"]  ...Gavial, your friend's really strong.
[Character(name="char_187_ccheal_1", name2="char_411_tomimi_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Gavial"]  She sure is a pain in the ass at times like this though.
[name="Gavial"]  I think we finally hit a lull. I'm gonna go up there and restrain her...

[name="Ceobe"]  You, Reunion! You're back!
[name="Ceobe"]  So you were the ones who took the Doctor!
[name="Ceobe"]  You won't get away!

[name="Gavial"]  Oh, you dumb... She's gonna escape again!
[name="Gavial"]  I'm going after her! Tomimi, you and the Doctor stay put! I'll come back and find you!

[name="Tomimi"]  They fought from noon until night without settling anything. No winner, no loser.
[name="Tomimi"]  They went until they'd used all their strength, and afterwards, both of them got dragged off by the others.
[name="Tomimi"]  That's the story of the first time Gavial joined the ceremony.
[Decision(options="What kind of person is Zumama?",values="1")]
[Predicate(references="1")]
[name="Tomimi"]  Zumama was someone from a different tribe, but she was fairly close.
[name="Tomimi"]  Back when they were young, she and Gavial fought a lot. Gavial was stronger than her, but it wasn't like Zumama never won.
[name="Tomimi"]  But then Gavial said Zumama just stopped caring about fighting for some reason. She started researching machines instead.
[name="Tomimi"]  And I remember that day was the last time Zumama and Gavial ever fought.
[name="Tomimi"]  After that, Zumama barely even showed her face anywhere. Eventually, her tribe moved away, and I never saw her again.
[name="Tomimi"]  Not even at that final mess of a ceremony before Gavial left. She never came.

[name="Gavial"]  But knowing how well she can fend for herself, I'm not worried. Tomimi, did Zumama get here yet?
