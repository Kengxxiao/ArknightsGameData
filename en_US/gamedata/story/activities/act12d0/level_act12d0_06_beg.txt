[name="High Priest"]  I have to say, that cannon was so astoundingly loud, I almost got blown out of the thing when it fired!
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  I'm asking you about the Big, Ugly Thing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=1)]
[name="High Priest"]  I was just sharing my personal situation with you. It went exactly as we expected. Firing the cannon in succession caused it to overheat.
[name="High Priest"]  But it went very well. Yes, I have to say, it was very effective! Despite the fact that it gave me quite the scare!
[name="High Priest"]  In any case, we will have to fix it up after we get back.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  Yeah, the ceremony happened way too quickly. The Big Ugly wasn't ready yet.
[name="Eunectes"]  I was hoping to wait until we finished it before talking to the other tribes about the ceremony, but they'd already gone ahead with it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=1)]
[name="High Priest"]  It's okay. It all turned out fine!
[name="High Priest"]  I still remember how shocked everyone was when they first saw the Big, Ugly Thing! Haha, that was so funny!
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  Yeah, we've accomplished our goal.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="High Priest"]  This will set in motion a new order! A new era! Yes, an age of machines! That has such a nice ring to it!
[name="High Priest"]  What do you think of the 'Age of Big Ugly'? Oh, maybe the 'Age of the High Priest' too. Yes, that sounds almost as cool as I do.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  Let's just call it the age of machines.

[name="High Priest"]  Sheesh, you have a lot going for you, but you're still behind the times. Now that you've learned what it's like outside, you should try to expand your horizons!
[name="High Priest"]  Here, check out my outfit. Don't you think it's trendy? Looks smart?
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  You're so short, I can't even see it. What does trendy mean, anyway?
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=1)]
[name="High Priest"]  Argh, never mind. My mistake. I shouldn't have brought this up. But no matter. I'll pick out some clothes befitting you, our next Great Chief.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  I don't mind how I dress. Anyway, I just got word from the tribesmen who stayed behind. They managed to steal an engine.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=1)]
[name="High Priest"]  What? Really?
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=2)]
[name="Eunectes"]  Yes, apparently they got it from the transport Gavial used to get here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_074",name2="char_416_zumama_1",focus=1)]
[name="High Priest"]  Wonderful! I can't wait to take a good look at it!
[name="High Priest"]  Oh, come to think of it, I can go check it out right now! I'll see you later!
[Character(name="char_416_zumama_1#5")]
