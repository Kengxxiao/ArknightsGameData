[name="Noir Corne"]According to the angiogram results, the villagers have been exposed to active Originium for at least a few years.
[name="Noir Corne"]Only in trace amounts, though, resulting in vague symptoms and only a few that have actually contracted Oripathy.
[name="Noir Corne"]It's due to limited exposure to an extremely low concentration of Originium particles, I think.

[Character(name="char_500_noirc_1",name2="avg_502_Yato_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Noir Corne"]No... that was high enough to induce Oripathy outright and is probably related to the few villagers who did contract the disease. They also mentioned they went into the forest.
