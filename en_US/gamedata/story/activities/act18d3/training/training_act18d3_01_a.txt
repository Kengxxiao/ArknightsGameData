[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Today, we will be learning how to respond to unconventional injuries.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] We've invited Operator Noir Corne to demonstrate in the simulation for us. Much appreciated, Noir Corne.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_noirc")] No problem, Instructor.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_noirc")] Watch. These enemies might look real weak, and normally for my defenses, I'd say blocking them's a piece of cake.
[Tutorial(focusX=3300, focusY=-130, focusWidth=100, focusHeight=100, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
But don't underestimate the enemy! These... weird monsters from I-don't-know-where can cause extra kinds of special <@tu.kw>nervous impairment</>!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_noirc")] That's right. Although <@tu.kw>nervous impairment</> won't directly harm us, it can ignore equipment defense functions and keep <@tu.kw>accumulating</>, and once it passes a certain threshold, it'll bring about some serious negative effects.
