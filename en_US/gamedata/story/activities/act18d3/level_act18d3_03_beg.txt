[name="Bishop"]Did you recover the kindred love between you? Could your heart be torn apart by what happened to your old relation? Do you feel it is unjust? Are you thus angered?

[name="Bishop"]As with you. You voluntarily became one of us, wishing to melt into the ocean true. Once you have completed this mission, your sordid nature will achieve purification. This is the ocean's charity to you.
[name="Bishop"]And in the end, charity alike will be extended to all your old relations. So long as they alike can relinquish their narrow views of a past enmity.
[name="Bishop"]To reunite you, that is the first step. To fathom you, that is the second step. And come the end, you will fathom us too.

[name="Bishop"]'Abyssal Hunters are bound by blood.'
[name="Bishop"]She has no inkling of what awaits her. All you had to do was take the other away, and she has given chase here, not having once rested.
[name="Bishop"]Truly a camaraderie to make one gasp. Does she know the state of you nowadays? What will she do when she confronts a traitor? Will she trust in your blood binding, old comrades rekindled, or will a blade pierce true through your body?

[name="Male Inhabitant A"]The time, is not yet come.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]The priest spoke so. The tide must flood and ebb one-hundred times, before we are permitted, to enter the sea.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Sheetmetal, we cannot come here. The shore, does not permit us to.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]That is meaningless. We will, block her.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Block her? As if we could defeat her?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]The priest spoke, we must wait one hundred times, before we may go. It is only, the ninety-ninth time now.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]She will obtain nothing at all. The shore today, has nothing at all.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]So what is she looking for?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Sheetmetal, it is bitterly cold here, I am hungry, we cannot come here, and you should not ask.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Is there anything in the sea?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]I do not know.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Even if you knew, what then?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]I do not know. Sheetmetal, what you say, I do not know any of. I do not understand.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Where is the furthest we have traveled, in the past?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]The westernmost of the west. A long time ago. In those days, we were, no taller than this. We could still, collect food in the town.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Borderline. We do not often, say this word. We have seen, this city's, edge.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]That was you, Sheetmetal, not we.
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]At that time, I was dizzy with hunger.
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]You said, you wanted to go further still. You wanted, to push your luck.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]It was to try my luck.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Hmph. You never could, make any sense. The priest gave you such years of teaching. You never could learn.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Heh-heh, Sheetmetal, you make. Sense of me.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]You said so, at that time too.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]You have always trusted me. You let me take the can you kept. I traveled another day.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]And then you came back.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Yes, I came back.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]You ate nothing, for several days after. I thought, you wanted to starve yourself to death.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]I thought of it. But what meaning, would starving myself have?
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]After all, we will all perish come not too long.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]You are giving me a shock. You said this back then too. I do not know what you are talking about.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Afterward... the priest came. It was only when he came, that I felt a change. We all changed.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]The priest, has a good life. He says we can have one. What he says is true.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]It is true. Because... it is the truth. He let us see it.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Because of the priest, I survived. We all survived. That is, very good.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]That line, no one can cross.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Is that line, the seawater line?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]All lines. Just like the traps Woodframe makes. They stop, even outsiders.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]We cannot exit either. That is for the best.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Sheetmetal... your leg, is going to meet the water!
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Water... yes. I shall not cross.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Even if I crossed over... crossed over, there may well be nothing there at all.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Phew... Sheetmetal, you finally stopped walking. You scared me just now.
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]Do not be like that, asking so many questions. You are like Woodframe, when you always ask. She was always strange. The priest said too that something is wrong about her, did he not?
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Questioning... cannot help us.
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Only answers have any meaning.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=2)]
[name="Male Inhabitant B"]You impress me so, Sheetmetal. You are the only one who remembers, the priest's words as strongly.
[character(name="avg_npc_178",name2="avg_npc_187",focus=1)]
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]......
[name="Male Inhabitant A"]Look, she has not stopped walking along the shore.
