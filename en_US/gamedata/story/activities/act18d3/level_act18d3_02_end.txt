[name="Old Inhabitant"]A wandering singer? I've never seen any wandering singer in my good long years.

[name="Old Inhabitant"]We dance in the square, yes, right here we do... oh, I could spin more times than you could count. I have a red skirt, girlie, and I must say, it's much more beautiful than the one you're wearing.
[name="Old Inhabitant"]So many youngsters want to dance with me. I like Manuel the most out of all of them. He was the most handsome when he was young.
[Character(name="avg_npc_180#3", name2="avg_npc_179#1",focus=1)]

[name="Female Inhabitant"]But that's okay. Everyone's in the same boat. If your house is gone, find another empty one and move in. Plenty of buildings fit the bill here.
[name="Female Inhabitant"]That's right, if you're not happy dancing, then can you sing for me?
[name="Female Inhabitant"]I've never heard anyone else sing before.
[Character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#4", name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Maybe.
[Character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#4", name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=2)]
[name="Female Inhabitant"]Wonderful!

[name="Female Inhabitant"]Oh, visiting so many places has gotten me hungry.
[name="Female Inhabitant"]You're hungry too, aren't you? If you're hungry, you can't sing, right?
[name="Female Inhabitant"]Let's go find something to eat.
[Character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#4", name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Um...
[Character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#4", name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=2)]
[name="Female Inhabitant"]Am I running too fast? I forgot you wouldn't know the way.
[name="Female Inhabitant"]Right, I'm Anita! You can just shout my name from now on, and that way you won't be left behind. Call for me, and I'll stop and wait for you.
