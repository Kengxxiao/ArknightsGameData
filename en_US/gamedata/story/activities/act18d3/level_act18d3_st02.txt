[name="Skadi"]I knew things weren't as simple as they seemed...
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]The Inquisition is simply keeping too many more secrets than the Iberian people deserve to know.
[character(name="avg_npc_183#3")]
[name="High Inquisitor"]My lady, need I remind you that spreading rumors and hearsay is strictly forbidden in Iberia?
[character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]High Inquisitor, I'm only saying this because you already know those secrets.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The Church of the Deep has infiltrated Iberia and is taking root here in secret.
[name="Kal'tsit"]They took advantage of the relationship you once had with the sea. Abandoned Iberian cities have become the beachhead for the Church of the Deep's encroachment onto dry land.
[name="Kal'tsit"]They have their own interpretations of your scriptures, and they use them to bend your will. They also hide well. With so many irons in the fire, there was never any way for you to attend to all of it.
[name="Kal'tsit"]So... you should cry out for help. If you continue this pointless war of territory and faith, we will miss our one chance.

[name="Kal'tsit"]What do you call the place where you live every day and night? The coast.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Other peoples live on land, while Iberians live by the coast.
[name="Kal'tsit"]For the majority of the population, whether they live in the wilderness or the cities, their sightlines are the sky above and an endless swath of land and mountains ahead.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Anything above the clouds means nothing.
[name="Kal'tsit"]When they talk about 'the world', they refer to these lands alone.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The land on which they live is the world to them, because they've decided there is nothing in this world beyond these lands.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Whether residing in sealed-off cities, out-of-the-way villages, or hostile wilderness, they believe in what they see, and nothing else.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Now look at them again. These Abyssal Hunters. These Ægir.
[name="Kal'tsit"]The ocean is vast in ways beyond the land.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Iberia is not like other countries.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Those who reside on land are obsessed with their ways and their authorities. They overlook the infinite possibilities, and the opportunities to explore the boundaries that they blindly choose to ignore.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Your world is far more complete. You understand both the land and the sea. Iberia has a much better knowledge of its place in the world than anyone else.

Iberia was once a prosperous nation, but how many of these ruins can be found here today?
Kal'tsit knows, and naturally the High Inquisitor knows too. However, with the High Inquisitor's steely composure, it is impossible to discern any kind of emotion from his expression whatsoever.
Furthermore, he is wearing a mask.
If they could cry, then the Iberians would definitely cry. If they could laugh, then the Iberians would definitely laugh out loud.
Yet here stands one such impassioned Iberian, who has since turned into the emotionless man before her.
Without expression and without emotion. Iberia's golden age has passed into a life of tranquility.

[name="Skadi"]Hm?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]I'm not the kind of person... who doesn't apologize when she's done wrong. I may be an Inquisitor, but when an Inquisitor makes a mistake, she needs to reflect on it all the more.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]When you first stepped into the town, I saw you right away. I could tell you were an Ægir, costume or no. You are different.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]......
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]At the time... I was angry, and my passions were inflamed. I thought I had finally found the answer. The evil outsiders, the culprit who brought this misfortune to us—
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]I thought that by dragging you out here and defeating you... I could right the wrongs and solve our problems. I thought it was that simple.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]But I am no match for you, and what could defeating you change anyway?
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]The real threat that this city and all Iberia faces is not a single Ægir or two.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#3",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]You've grown...
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#3",name2="avg_npc_182#1",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]Much thanks to you...
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]I can't think the way I used to think anymore. What happened here has left me bewildered to the point that I'm not sure how I'd judge anything again.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]I am an inquisitor. It is my duty to eradicate the threats that Iberia faces in order to uphold its order.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]—You are a threat, but are you our enemy?
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]Then we have the people here. Should I protect them, or should they be eliminated?
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]And what if I can't make sense of it? What, then, is my reason for taking up the sword? It will leave me directionless, stuck in the same spot, just like the people here.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#1",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]Then—It was you and the locals who helped me see things clearly.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]I can't save the inhabitants... It probably sounds strange, but once I realized this, I made the decision to protect them.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]At the very least, at that very moment and right now, I know what is right and what is wrong.
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]As for you, you did the right thing. You protected this place... for the time being, at least. That is much more than I have ever done for these people.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#3",name2="avg_npc_182#1",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]......
[name="Skadi"]You did the right thing too.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#3",name2="avg_npc_182#5",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]Huh?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#5",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]What I did was no different from what you did.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]What do you mean, no different...? No matter, you are just as terrible at giving comfort as you are at disguises.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]You wanted comfort from me?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#3",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]What do you...? No, no thank you.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#3",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Good. I don't have any for you either.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#2",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]......
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#1",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]So, you found the answer you were looking for?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#1",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]I don't need it anymore.
[name="Skadi"]I've asked too many questions. I found my answer, and once I calmed down, I realized those answers meant nothing really. Just like you, I know which way I am headed now.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#5",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]Oh? Seems we're both ready.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#1",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]It's about time I get going, and I know it's time for you to go as well. You have gone free, so you must've come to some kind of agreement with the High Inquisitor.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_182#5",focus=2)]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]Well... Goodbye.
[character(name="avg_npc_182#6")]
[name="Inquisitor Irene"]As long as we're still chasing the same goal, perhaps we will see each other again somewhere.

Before the waves engulf the world and those monstrous colossi summon their bloodkin, we must smother the sea with silence. Its brood will know nothing of this.
We will exterminate them at their source.
This is our only chance. This will bring about a calamity... but Ægir will get its moment of reprieve.
I can't hear Ægir. Heh, just like the monsters waiting in vain for their revelations.
Nonetheless, we have a responsibility. The Abyssal Hunters must be the first to uncover Iberia's secrets.
—The last dreadnought of the Iberian fleet. Indomitable, yet disappearing without a trace in the span of a night.
