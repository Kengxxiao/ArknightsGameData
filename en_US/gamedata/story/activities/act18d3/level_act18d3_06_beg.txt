[name="Anita"]You are hurt, and you spent so much of your energy. You haven't completely recovered yet, have you?
[name="Anita"]You should come back with me and get some rest. You will feel much better once you get more sleep.

[name="Anita"]No, Singer, don't go!
[name="Anita"]It's not that I'm not telling the truth. I just... don't understand.
[name="Anita"]Singer, to all of us... To me, you are still a mystery. You came from the outside, and I've never met anyone like you...
[name="Anita"]You want to know how I guessed that you are here. It's not that I'm trying to lie. I'm just... embarrassed.
[name="Anita"]This is... the outskirts. It's as far as it gets from the city.
[name="Anita"]I know that you are hiding from us, and I thought this is where you would probably come too if you wanted to run away.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#2",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]'Too?'
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#4",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]I come here often myself. Of course, I don't tell Sheetmetal or anyone. They aren't happy when they find me running this far away.
[name="Anita"]Look at that chunk over there. It's tall. I climb on there sometimes. The stronger the wind gets, the farther I can see.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#4",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]You are curious about what's outside.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#4",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]I don't know. I... I sometimes wonder about how it's like outside. It's pretty pointless, I know, and they kept telling me that too, so all I do is imagine it all by myself here.
[name="Anita"]This is the furthest I've gone whenever I go outside to scavenge. Outside... There's nothing useful outside.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#4",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]If you're curious about what's outside, you just have to walk a little further.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#4",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]I used to go to the west side. Sheetmetal would warn me that there were monsters outside, and we would die if we ever stepped out.
[name="Anita"]Singer, you are from the outside. I am following you around because I have lots and lots of questions... I want to know if what Sheetmetal said is actually true.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#4",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Perhaps.
[name="Skadi"]If you head outside, you will die.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#1",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]Phew... so it's true...
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#1",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]You aren't disappointed.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#1",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]Singer, if I have the chance, I think I want to see it for myself.
[name="Anita"]It doesn't matter if there are monsters there... I don't think I'm scared of them.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#1",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Hm?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#1",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]The Inquisitor said I'm not afraid of monsters because I don't know what they would do to me.
[name="Anita"]I think she's right about that.

[name="Anita"]*cough*, *cough*...
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#2",focus=1)]

[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]Haha... That's gotta be because you know the monsters can't do anything to you.
[name="Anita"]Not like me. Last night was the first time I got a good look of those monsters. I didn't know what was going to happen to me. My heart was racing like never before.
[name="Anita"]Then, when I woke up this morning, the weather felt so much better than I've ever experienced. I could feel the wind, and I could see the sea waves splashing ever closer.
[name="Anita"]This day has been different than all the other days I've lived, because I don't know what's going to happen.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Sounds like you're excited.

[name="Anita"]Excited?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#2",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]Fear and excitement are pretty much the same. Both get your heart racing and your blood flowing.

[name="Anita"]Am I sick?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#2",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]You are not sick. To some people out there, this is what it means to be alive.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]I didn't know it feels this good to be alive. Is it like this outside every day?
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#3",focus=1)]
[name="Skadi"]It must feel better than here.
[character(name="avg_1012_skadiSP_1#1",name2="avg_npc_180#2",focus=2)]
[name="Anita"]Can I really go outside...?
[name="Anita"]My box... Once my box is full.
[name="Anita"]I need to... get more food. I need to make sure Grandma Petra's all set.
[name="Anita"]I... Argh!
