[name="Performer B"]  It has been a while, dear brother of ours.
[name="Performer B"]  Together, we left our birthplace. Together, we came of age. We were relatives of different blood. We ate as one, lived as one, yet saw not the same ending.
[name="Performer B"]  It has been an eternity since I have spoken to you. Since the candle melted away, since my blood dripped with the candle upon the stage, since then have we not spoken.
[name="Performer C"]  We differ from you. A performer unable to know the true taste of art is but a failed, rejected article. Only the love. None of the gift.
[name="Performer C"]  While some throw themselves upon the flame, some fly away.
[name="Performer B"]  And some yet stay there in the bygone past. In that night. There the sound of singing arises, and never ceases.

[name="Human Resources Operator"]  And you can't blame her, really.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Once you've seen her pitting herself against her own standards, upset at herself for falling so visibly and palpably short, getting chewed out by her from time to time doesn't feel so rough...

[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Circling back to that, we've got a decent amount of operators' files in incomplete states. In general, standard protocol for small questions is we'd find the person themselves and ask directly.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  But Operator Phantom's kind of tricky in this regard... I'm gonna put it straight. We can barely figure out where he is.
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mint"]  Is he not on the ship right now?
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1",focus=1)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  No. Our mission records say he's not out in the field for anything.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Operator Phantom seems to be deliberately avoiding people. Add in his Arts, and we've had our work cut out finding him.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  We could lie in wait in places, or ask Miss Closure for help... but we just can't spare a single person and waiting's not an option, and as for the latter, well, mm...
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  I heard he caused some trouble when he joined us and now Miss Closure's... pissed off with him.
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  So we'd probably be telling her 'this is your chance to give him a public execution,' right? It's hard to even guess what would happen afterwards.
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1#5",focus=2)]

[name="Mint"]  Are Mr. Phantom's Originium Arts similar to Mr. Ethan's? Or... um, waitletmelookatthemanual. Right! Like Miss Manticore's?
[name="Mint"]  She has the ability to hide where she is too, doesn't she?
[Character(name="char_016_medic",name2="char_388_mint_1",focus=1)]
[name="Human Resources Operator"]  Yep. I remember when she signed on. It was just as much of an effort back then to get her records filled out.

[name="Human Resources Operator"]  But if you're going to lie about the most basic things, then that's a completely different matter!
