Bob, how have you been?
I received your letter. I'm happy to hear you made it to Columbia safely.
We're all doing well enough. At the least, we're all alive.
Chainsmoke still wants to arm wrestle you, just once, and win. Chef remembers your bounty hunters owe him three gold coins.
It might be a little late by the time the Messenger reaches Columbia, but even so, I wanted to congratulate you.
I'm glad you could escape it all, Bob. Really.
I still remember your invitation. I'm very grateful you still remember us Sarkaz.
But—

Bob. What kind of place is Columbia?
I've heard that the Infected are allowed a life so long as they work. They form the low-cost workforce she needs to serve her limitless expansion, and nothing more.
Even so, I guess you're all very suited to the work? Is your farm big? Are the wheat fields swept in the autumn winds as beautiful as the movies say?
Though it's hard to admit, I've never seen real hops for myself.
I've asked a lot of people, and I've even sought out books on botany... so I have an idea of what hops flowers look like.
If I find my own calm corner of the world to live in, I'll write to you from there. If I do, could you send me a small sample in return?

Kazdel is a desolate barren. Still, some wanderers have taken to the old ruins of bygone wars. Founded towns you could call prosperous.
Resplendent cities the Sarkaz had never been allowed to have. But I'm only asking for somewhere quiet. A place to catch my breath for a while, in the middle of this age-old conflict.

[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053", focus=2)]

Bob, how have you been?
This letter is sent to you from the care of my new employer. I suppose sending a second letter without waiting for a reply might confuse things?
To tell the truth, the people I mentioned in my last letter may not have the chance to meet you again.
But there's no need to mourn. They fought to protect innocent Infected. As Sarkaz mercenaries, they never thought they'd get to die so nobly.
Maybe death can't be defined in terms of how noble it was. But the people who live on have no doubt in their minds. They died with honor.
We are not currently in Kazdel. For some reason or another, the moment we were about to make it, we looked back.
Maybe it was my hesitation that let so many of my people die. Or maybe their deaths were a reminder that fate follows as close as my shadow. None of us can escape it.
And so I decided to resist. Maybe I wanted to fight against every injustice in this world. Maybe I just wanted my friends to be able to live on.
I haven't sorted it all out yet. But we must walk forward. Only then can I shoulder all my past wrongs. Only then can I let so many more people who need not die, live on.
Oh, before I forget. I've heard a few things about you here. From a girl named Grani.
I couldn't find a home for my people like you did. I couldn't hold a candle to you. That's my shame.
Live on well, Bob. Maybe one day... far in the future, I'll be able to see you and your people in Columbia.
