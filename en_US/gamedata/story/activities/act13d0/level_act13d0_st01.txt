[name="Meteorite"]  Judging by the image, this should be the place. The nomadic hamlet Bellony Village.
[name="Meteorite"]  Though I think you could just call the entire village an oversized minecart instead.
[name="Meteorite"]  It's a mining town that carries around its own Originium-powered drills to keep itself going. The people bring in some revenue just selling the excess resources to nearby cities.
[name="Meteorite"]  If they find any big ruins, they even ask the larger nomadic cities to front the excavation costs.
[Character(name="char_350_surtr_1#6",name2="char_219_meteo_1",focus=1)]
[name="Surtr"]  Maybe, but this place still looks pretty rough.
[name="Surtr"]  There is dust everywhere and the fences are all run-down. There are obvious signs of habitation, but no one cares to do maintenance?
[name="Surtr"]  I don't see anything worth investigating.
[Character(name="char_350_surtr_1#6",name2="char_219_meteo_1",focus=2)]

[name="Kal'tsit"]   Bellony Village is a typical mining community located at the edge of Kazdel. A cave-in a few months ago completely sealed off the mines.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Not only were the mines ruined, the village's travel route and trading channels were also blocked.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   For the past few months, the village has been requesting aid from nearby nomadic cities, but there has not yet been any city willing to help.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   Meteorite, I would like you to carry out preliminary investigations and report on the situation.
[name="Kal'tsit"]   We will organize a rescue mission based on that report.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1")]
[name="Meteorite"]  Understood. This doesn't sound like a particularly tough mission.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]   The village's problems don't appear to be related to Catastrophes or Oripathy, but don't let your guard down.

Surtr. The file mentioned her.
Due to a memory impairment of unknown origins, she has difficulty reconciling her memories.
It is as if there is a large volume of memories existing simultaneously in her mind. The volume is such that Surtr is unable to properly recognize which of her memories are real and which are false.

[name="Surtr"]  The ruins of a city in a giant cavern...?

Surtr enters the cavern deep beneath the earth.
Beside the glow of Originium Slugs, she can trace the outlines of buildings among the piles of stone and rubble.
Tiles of a road, bricks of a wall.
It is very clear that the entire place has been buried for a very long time.
Dozens of years? Hundreds of years?
Surtr does not know either. Yet, she has found that which she is looking for.

[name="Surtr"]  Ah, thanks for pinpointing the location. I was able to break the rock layer at the correct spot.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  What were you thinking?! Why would you rush into such a dangerous place all by yourself?!
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Surtr"]  I was doing a little thing called 'investigating'.
[name="Surtr"]  Incidentally, I discovered the cause of the cave-ins. There was a nest of Originium Slugs below the mine, inside a giant cavern.
[name="Surtr"]  The mining put more pressure on the bottom, so the whole thing just collapsed.
[name="Surtr"]  I destroyed the Originium Slug nest and used the cave-in to seal up the entire cavern. Done.
[name="Surtr"]  Though we skipped over the standard procedures, the issue was resolved.

[name="Village Headman"]  What!
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1")]

[name="Meteorite"]  So, you solved the whole problem by yourself, but you didn't find the path to the neighboring village?
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Surtr"]  Right, I realized that neither village was the one in my memory.
[name="Surtr"]  I made a mistake. There aren't any memories I'm looking for here.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  You'd mess up something you recorded so diligently all this while?
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Surtr"]  I suppose I would.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  I've seen something like this before.
[name="Meteorite"]  You run into all sorts of problems on the way to your goal.
[name="Meteorite"]  It's thanks to the people beside me that I've made it this far.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Surtr"]  I'm used to it.
[name="Surtr"]  After all, this isn't the first time there was a discrepancy in the places I remember.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  But even if you didn't find the right place today, you still have a place to call home, right?
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=2)]
[name="Surtr"]  Are you trying to say I can rely on you too?
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="char_350_surtr_1",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  Um, I guess you could put it that way...
[Character(name="avg_npc_006")]
[name="Village Headman"]  Ladies! I've notified the others in the village!
[name="Village Headman"]  The exploration team is getting ready! It sounds like you've taken care of things and we can get back to mining.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="avg_npc_006",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  Please wait for us to bring our data back to Rhodes Island before you go back in there.
[name="Meteorite"]  We wouldn't want any more accidents.
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="avg_npc_006",focus=2)]
[name="Village Headman"]  Hahaha, that's fine. Everyone's too excited. I really have to thank you both.
[name="Village Headman"]  If you don't mind, why don't you spend the night in the village?
[name="Village Headman"]  You'll be our guests of honor!
[Character(name="char_219_meteo_1",name2="avg_npc_006",focus=1)]
[name="Meteorite"]  Well...
[Character(name="char_350_surtr_1")]
[name="Surtr"]  We have to hurry back, so I'm afraid we'll pass.
[name="Surtr"]  But...
[name="Surtr"]  Could I have an ice-cream?
