[name="Arene"]  You need me to take my weapon down to the workshop for inspection, and have the people there sign off on it?

[name="Arene"]  Can't you bend the rules a little bit, Professor? Just sign off for me.
[name="Arene"]  You can't? We have procedures?

[name="???"]  Hello there. The workshop isn't open right now. All five of our craftsmen are involved in a weapon repair contest.
[name="???"]  If you need anything, please come back after 3 o'clock.
[Character(name="char_271_arene_1#6")]
[name="Arene"]  A weapon repair contest? They really have contests for everything, don't they?
[name="Arene"]  How does it work? Do you break the weapons first and then repair them? Or is it about who polishes a shinier blade?
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1")]
[name="???"]  Sorry to disappoint, but it's just a contest where you repair weapons damaged out in the field.
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1#3")]
[name="???"]  But if you manage to make a weapon shiny enough to give it a deadly glint, I suppose you'd have a fair chance of winning.
[Character(name="char_211_adnach_1#2")]
[name="???"]  ...Hm? That doesn't sound like a bad idea. I'll give it a try next time.

[name="Arene"]  That's right.
[Character(name="char_271_arene_1",name2="char_211_adnach_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="???"]  Your weapon needs to be inspected by two craftsmen before it can be approved.
[name="???"]  And I'm technically still an intern assistant. I'm afraid signing my name there isn't going to do you much help.
[Character(name="char_271_arene_1",name2="char_211_adnach_1",focus=1)]
[name="Arene"]  So it needs to be signed off by two people. Perfect. We've got two people right here, you and me.
[name="Arene"]  I know my staff better than anyone else, and I know for certain there is nothing wrong with it. If nothing happens, no one is going to find out, and if no one finds out, then we don't have a problem. Am I right?

[name="???"]  I don't recommend underestimating the people here, though. Definitely not the strict ones.
[name="???"]  If something does happen, there's going to be quite a ruckus. Even though they aren't here right now, all the craftsmen will face punishment. It'll be even worse for the two of us.
