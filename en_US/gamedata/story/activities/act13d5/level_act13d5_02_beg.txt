[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Well, look who do we have here!? If it isn't the rising star of the Roar Guards! You made it here early!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  The audience's still outside, and there's still two hours until the first event of the day. Getting yourself ready for the fight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  It's been a long time since the last time I fought in this kind of arena... It brings back memories.
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Right, I'm curious. I mean, your title's 'Plastic', and it's one of your main selling points...
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  But aren't you already at the top of your knightclub's rankings after last month's competitions? What do you need to push yourself so hard for?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  ...It's what my sponsor wants. Nothing I can do about it. I had to cancel my holiday for this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Oh, you're after that, aren't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_121", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]

[name="???"]  Certainly, we have something to look forward to... However, before that, please allow me to have a chat with Mr. 'Plastic' Szewczyk, one-on-one.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  And you are...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  I work on the Major's preliminaries. Here is my business card, Mr. Szewczyk.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  ...You 'work on' them, huh? What do you want?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  I'm merely here to inform you of this.
[name="???"]  The Roar Guards Company has requested that you wear its latest Jack 2 model body armor in your one-on-one match, or 'duel' as it is more commonly called, with Maria Nearl, and to prolong the match for as long as possible.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  What? But the materials that went into the new armor isn't meant for competition use—
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  No matter. The Nearls' comeback has attracted countless press to today's events. This is a perfect opportunity.
[name="???"]  They've already made a significant investment to secure that long term trade agreement. They merely needed a gamble of reasonable odds. A test, and also a publicity stunt.
[name="???"]  For your services, the Roar Guards' publicity department has also promised quite a significant down payment... Three times your post-tax total income last year.
[name="???"]  With just this one match, Mr. Szewczyk, you'll be earning enough to buy out an entire village in your homeland.
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  ...Do they really have to go that far?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  The exposure and publicity are just secondary objectives. They'll become the talk of the town. This, along with the profits the Major will bring in, will give the Roar Guards more of a... yes... more of a say at the General Chamber of Commerce.
[name="???"]  After all, having a voice at such venues is very important, wouldn't you agree?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  If it's what my sponsors want... and there's money in it, who am I to complain?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  Your assistance is much appreciated. We know very well that you, too, have some special needs...
[name="???"]  Oh yes, have you met the Nearl family's youngest daughter yet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=2)]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  I've seen her debut match. She's not bad, but still a disappointment compared to the Radiant Knight.
[name="Plastic Knight"]  ...Are you worried that I'll lose?
[Character(name="avg_npc_106", name2="avg_npc_103", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  No... The thought never crossed my mind. Pardon me. We've already sent a brand new set of equipment, along with a list of all the necessary precautions for the new armor, to your residence. Please...

[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_107", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  If I count from the day Zofia had me train her in swordsmanship, it took her four whole years to get to the preliminaries... But Maria only had four weeks.
[name="Old Knight"]  We should keep an eye on them. When it's time to call it quits, that's when they need to stop. We mustn't let them go overboard.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_107", focus=2)]
