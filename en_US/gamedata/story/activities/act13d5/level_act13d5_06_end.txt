[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  The previous Platinum harbored a secret love for his target, and so for the sake of protecting the object of his affections, he died at the Armorless Union's hands.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  As a result, the girl of today was pushed hastily into the position, our 'youngest Platinum.'
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  ...She is a gifted mark, make no joke, and I must say her strong potential makes her unignorably suited for the role... but in all other respects, she is far and away one of the least mature to ever assume the position.
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#2", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=1)]
[name="Corporate Employee"]  I-I see... Why are you telling me this? The Armorless Union's existence should be classified... so aren't you...
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#2", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Oh, do lay your concerns aside. It's simply been on my mind quite a bit as of late. Had I not made the effort to get to where I am today, I would hardly enjoy the privilege to ponder it.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Did you know? Our present Platinum was elected to the position by the very Platinum before her, doomed to die as he was.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  A great deal of food for thought... Not to mention why the Armorless Union would listen to a traitor, to say nothing of how electing this girl would have absolutely no impact on his own death sentence. For what reason did he do this?
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Before the arrow of his own colleague shot through his chest, did he think to cry out? To whom? Of what? To what end? Would it have been that easy?

[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  No no no, your work is what they pay your salary for. You needn't use such humble language.

[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Blade Helmet Knightclub commander. Noble knight, big commercial name, been as far as the Final 16. Tytus Topola.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Zofia"]  But... But there should be no way Maria gets matched against him at her point level, and his social standing is...

[name="Bald Marcin"]  Someone came looking for Maria. It wasn't good.

[name="Zofia"]  You think... she's like Margaret?
[name="Zofia"]  Margaret KNEW what she was doing. Maria only got like this after falling for her own wishful thinking about her own ideals.
[name="Zofia"]  She's not even clear what's in front of her, and she doesn't know what to do about it. She can't keep pushing upwards like this!
[name="Zofia"]  Maria was so much more carefree before this... She doesn't need to be the kind of knight you and I were, does she?
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  You might be right, but you need to remember she's got her own mind for things. You can't decide it all for her.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  She's still real young, and uneasy at that. Maybe her being carefree was all just so she wouldn't worry you.
