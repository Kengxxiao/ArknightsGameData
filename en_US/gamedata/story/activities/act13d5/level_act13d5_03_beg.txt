[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Not only did you manage to find Szewczyk's weakness, you even finished him in one blow. You did really well.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  The fight lasted for almost twenty minutes. Maria had been at a disadvantage during most of the fight, but she turned the tables on him with just one crucial strike—
[name="Bald Marcin"]  —Very well done.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  I-It wasn't anything special... I wouldn't have been able to do it if he wasn't wearing a flawed set of armor...
[name="Maria"]  I'd never heard of the model Jack 2 before... If the cooling system could paralyze the armor even for a short time, then it's definitely still a prototype.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  —That said, Szewczyk's an experienced competition knight, and endorsing untested products actually isn't that uncommon at all. He also managed to hide the armor's weaknesses well.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Don't be so humble. It's barbaric, but the Major has always been about results and results only.

[name="Old Knight"]  Hey.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#2", name2="avg_npc_107", focus=2)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  ...Yeah, how long ago was it when Zofia first stepped into the arena? Twelve years ago? Fifteen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_107", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  How old you are is none of my business, and I don't remember exactly when, but Zofia's not that old...
[name="Old Knight"]  It was nine years ago, wasn't it? The Blood Knight, The Radiant Knight, The Black Knight... It was three seasons ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_107#2", focus=2)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  The Black Knight... That Caprinae, huh? Feels like a lifetime ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_107#2", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Well, she won the three Majors before that too. The media likes to treat her like some sort of emblem of that generation or something.

[name="Maria"]  Oh, the three-time consecutive winner?
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_101", focus=2)]
[name="Old Craftsman"]  Yeah, normally, they don't pick words that common when they come up with titles, lest they get repeated and complicate things.
[name="Old Craftsman"]  But that Leithanian lass. She actually deserves the title 'Black.' She's a monster, no mistake.
[name="Old Craftsman"]  I heard she's working for some large company outside the country, tsk, tsk.

[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_061#5", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  ...Maria, has Zofia ever told you anything about her career in the Major?
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_061#5", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  No. There are the videos and stats from each season, but she hasn't told me anything herself...
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  I think Auntie Zofia made it to the top 16 that year, and during the round of 16...
[Character(name="avg_npc_120#3", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  That's right. She was heavily wounded.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Her opponent was the 'Fissure.' That reminds me, did he enter the Major this year?

[name="Maria"]  Actually... I'm kinda curious about that...
[name="Maria"]  I managed to win, but it doesn't seem like Zofia's very happy about it... She didn't even say anything and went straight to drinking...
[name="Maria"]  I'm sure she thought really hard about all this for me... I don't want to let her down... so I want to know more about her past and how she feels about everything.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5", name2="avg_npc_101", focus=2)]
[name="Old Craftsman"]  Well... You're just like your sister when it comes to that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2", name2="avg_npc_101", focus=1)]
[name="Maria"]  Me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  That's right. You're always quick to notice if something's amiss, and you always try to do something about it.
[name="Old Knight"]  That last attack of the match. Did Zofia teach you that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  N-No, actually—
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  You copied Margaret's move?
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  Eh? Oh, umm... Yeah... was it obvious?
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Hahaha, of course. You two are so alike! And I'll never forget that day.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  The miracle of the Radiant Knight, the youngest ever champion. She accomplished all that without help from anyone else.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  And she doesn't show it, but Zofia actually really looks up to Margaret.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  She was just a lady-in-waiting to your family, but she really tried her hardest. She even had us old farts help her train...
[name="Bald Marcin"]  She entered the preliminaries, won, and made it into the Major... From the beginning all the way to the end, she didn't accept any sponsorship offers, nor did she ever ask anyone for help.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Heh... I even introduced her to a few small businesses I knew back in the day, but she turned down every one of them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_101", focus=2)]
[name="Old Craftsman"]  ...Those companies are all trash. She made the right call to turn them down.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_101", focus=1)]
[name="Old Knight"]  Shut up. That's exactly why 'Fissure' defeated Zofia.
[Character(name="avg_npc_120", name2="avg_npc_061#5", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  What happened...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_061#5", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Maria, a competition knight needs a lot of resources... That's something you'll come to know... The weapons and equipment you bring to battle could be the difference between life and death.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Szewczyk probably only lost to you because the armor they made him wear had a design flaw.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Suppose he wore a set of armor that had no flaws at all, maybe even with far superior capabilities. What happens then? Do you think you could've won?
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  I...
[name="Maria"]  ...Probably not...
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  That's the kind of opponent Zofia faced. Flawless armor, weapons, and support. The difference between them was immense.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Zofia paid for her own equipment. She perfected her technique all alone, and she made all the connections herself. It was just her, and she fought so hard.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_101#2", focus=2)]
[name="Old Craftsman"]  ...*Sigh*.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_101#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  We never did anything for her except watch her get hurt and throw in the towel.
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Was there anything we could've done?
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_061#7", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  Marcin...
[Character(name="avg_npc_107#2", name2="avg_npc_101#2", focus=2)]
[name="Old Craftsman"]  At the very least, you could help Zofia train the kid.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_101#2", focus=1)]
[name="Bald Marcin"]  Hahaha, I doubt Maria would want to be coached by ol' one-armed Marcin, the same man who had a hand in Zofia's injury, indirectly.
[Character(name="avg_npc_107", name2="avg_npc_061#5", focus=2)]
[name="Maria"]  No, I would love to! I've always admired all of you! I mean it!

[name="Corporate Employee"]  Well... Ms. Zofia, Ms. Maria... This isn't part of the business proposal, but please at least hear me out...

[name="Maria"]  Uh... your teeth are chattering... A-Are you crying? All I did was decline your offer... It's no big deal!

[name="Corporate Employee"]  Uh, n-no... I'm simply hoping that... in the event that anyone else comes to you—Ms. Maria, in particular—with any business propositions, please—
[name="Corporate Employee"]  —Please seriously consider accepting! I'm begging you. This is very important to us...

[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  As the most important preliminary event of the Kazimierz Major, these tryouts have been going on for three months already, and there are still contestants throwing their hats in the ring!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Even so, I dare say, what we're about to witness today is unlike anything we've seen before!

[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  The Butcher of the Field from the Bloodboil Knightclub! The ruthless knight who has never allowed even a single opponent to step out of the ring in one piece!
