[name="Corporate Employee"]  Y-Yes, if you put it that way, I'd definitely be a good person, a good person like so many others in Kazimierz...
[Character(name="avg_npc_109", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Indeed, so many others. Here. Let us toast to the good people.

[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Tell me. If there were some who sought to deprive good people of their work, to deprive good people of their way of life, could those possibly be good people, now?

[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Even the countryside farmers, done tending their fields for the day, will look forward to that competition knight broadcast from the city.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  For hundreds of thousands... possibly millions of Kazimierz's industrial people, the Major is a part of life. And they are all good people, by and large, my friend.
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#2", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=1)]
[name="Corporate Employee"]  So, you mean...
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#2", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Suppose, one day, the Major was gone... that overnight, the business had vanished.
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  Who would now support our campaign knights' expenditures, which grow annum by annum? Who would vie for Kazimierz's economic standing, and so stave off foreign incursions?
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  My friend, tell me. Are those who would see that happen—bad people?

[name="Corporate Employee"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#3", name2="avg_npc_106#3", focus=2)]
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  You are a good person, and they would deprive you of your own living to crown their ancient sense of 'honor.'
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  We all rely on others to pave the way. We've given the vast majority—even the Infected—the chance to live...
[name="Spokesman Czarny"]  And so those 'bad people' would ignore that, their country and all its citizens, for their own inconsequential, self-centered consolation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#3", name2="avg_npc_106", focus=2)]
