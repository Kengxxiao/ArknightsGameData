[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  He blocked it! Szewczyk, a crossbowman, managed to block Maria's attack without even breaking a sweat!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Our Nascent Nearl, Maria, is running out of ideas!

[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  So the Arts were all just a fluke... Was there even a point to that? It was your last chance.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#2")]
[name="Maria"]  Mr. Szewczyk, how's the automatic cooling system doing for you during combat?
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Well, color me surprised... If you figured that out so quickly, maybe you should've been a mechanic, not a knight.
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5")]
[name="Maria"]  —Mr. Szewczyk, you're a really strong knight. Your speed and techniques are impeccable.
[name="Maria"]  Sadly, it looks like you chose to be a corporate product tester instead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  ...None of your business, and I suggest you stop underestimating the Roar Guards' technological prowess.

[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Ohh?! Maria's willingly pulled herself back! What's the meaning of this?! What were the two of them talking about?!
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  I'm sure our audience is curious about that, too. I've always been an advocate for giving the knights mics—Who doesn't want to listen in on our contestants trash-talking each other?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_npc_123", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  Well, the crowd's getting all fired up again.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_npc_123", focus=2)]
[name="???"]  It seems like Maria Nearl figured something out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_122", name2="avg_npc_123", focus=1)]
[name="???"]  Yeah, it looks like it. Well, no matter. Knights should spend more time thinking instead of always trying to brute force a win.
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Cheap tricks...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_121")]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  He stops! He shoots! Szewczyk's starting his hunt again—Wait! Maria sidestepped the obstacles on the ground, and she's dashing straight towards Szewczyk!
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  Hmm?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_121#3")]
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Szewczyk! Szewczyk's not moving an inch! Is he going to take that hit straight on like last time?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_103")]
[name="Plastic Knight"]  *Warning sounds* Tsk! This stupid cooling system—!
[Character(name="avg_npc_061#5")]
[name="Maria"]  Sorry about this!

[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  Was it because Szewczyk underestimated her opponent, a newbie? Was it their conversation that determined the victor? This is why I said the knights should get mics—
[name="Greatmouth Mob"]  In any case! Whatever excuses you've got, it's all too late now! I'm honored to announce the results of the first match of the day!
