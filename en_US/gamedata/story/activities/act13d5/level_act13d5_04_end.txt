[name="Zofia"]  You're the one who... *sigh*... I remember you had your own little company, and then you broke into my place like this, thinking you'd make off with all my sponsorship rights.
[name="Zofia"]  Well, out with it. What now?
[Character(name="avg_npc_109", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Corporate Employee"]  I, uh, there's some... I have some info here... probably some of it's rumors...
[Character(name="avg_npc_109#2", name2="avg_npc_064_weapon_1#5", focus=1)]
