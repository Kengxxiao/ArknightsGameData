[name="Ptilopsis"]     I think it should be in this diary...
[name="Ptilopsis"]     No, this one was written at Rhine Lab. So, it should be this one...
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Yes, this one. This diary is from after I came to Rhodes Island with Silence.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Let me see.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     March 21 \ Overcast
[name="Diary"]     Today, two new operators came to the Island. One named Hung and one named Aak. They seem to be from the same place as Waai Fu.
[name="Diary"]     It is significant that Aak, who looks very young, is said to be a very famous back-alley doctor in Lungmen. But it seems he will not join the medical section.
[name="Diary"]     April 2 \ Cloudy
[name="Diary"]     Ever since he found out that Warfarin is 'Mr. Blood,' he has been visiting the medical section regularly.
[name="Diary"]     But most of the medical section does not like him. This is because he does nothing to conceal his disrespect for us as his peers.
[name="Diary"]     He is clearly highly skilled at healing Arts. Why...?
[name="Diary"]     April 15 \ Sunny
[name="Diary"]     ...Speaking of Aak, Hung came to take him away after his latest competition with Warfarin. He has since curbed his behavior somewhat.
[name="Diary"]     And the medical team is growing accustomed to his personality——at least outwardly.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     This diary must be from the time of his second 'duel' with Warfarin.

[name="Diary"]     June 10 \ Light rain
[name="Diary"]     The reconnaissance operators appear to have discovered a vein of Originium ore in a nearby mountain range, and Dr. Kal'tsit has sent a team to investigate.
[name="Diary"]     To be safe, Silence and a few medic operators went along.
[name="Diary"]     Nothing else to do today but wait for test results.
[name="Diary"]     May 15 \ Sunny
[name="Diary"]     Gavial came back from an operation and told us at dinner that she grew so annoyed with the enemy scurrying around that she personally waded into battle and cut them all down.
[name="Diary"]     She seems to have forgotten that she is a medic operator. But she did make it sound appealing.
[name="Diary"]     May 1 \ Cloudy
[name="Diary"]     Today, after interviewing a new medic operator, I talked with Ansel about what we were doing before coming to Rhodes Island.
[name="Diary"]     I couldn't reveal much of the inner workings of Rhine Lab to him due to confidentiality agreements, but it was a meaningful conversation.

[name="Ptilopsis"]     Yes, Silence has had me on a customized course of treatment from then until now.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     And Silence herself is Infected, and she has her own course.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Such things are not uncommon at Rhine Lab.
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1",name2="char_128_plosis_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ansel"]     So Rhine Lab does a few things just like Rhodes Island. I always thought of Rhine Lab as a technology company.
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1",name2="char_128_plosis_1",focus=2)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Well, it's not a proactive approach to outreach like Rhodes Island's. I can't say more.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     But it is safe to assume that Rhine Lab cooperates with Rhodes Island in this area due to a shared outlook.
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1",name2="char_128_plosis_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ansel"]     Indeed.
[name="Ansel"]     Then I guess it's my turn.
[name="Ansel"]     Hmmm.... There's not much to say. My hometown is in Rim Billiton, and since my family was poor, I never had much access to technology, or really anything new.
[name="Ansel"]     After bouncing around a bit, I stumbled on a job listing for Rhodes Island. I put in a resume just to see what would happen, and here I am.
[name="Ansel"]     It blew me away when I first got here. I never thought I'd ever get to work in a place like this.
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1",name2="char_128_plosis_1",focus=2)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Indeed. I did not think of Rhodes Island as a small land cruiser when Silence first discussed the cooperation agreement.
[Character(name="char_212_ansel_1",name2="char_128_plosis_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ansel"]     But I've certainly learned a lot since coming here, and the remuneration is pretty good.
[name="Ansel"]     It's a bit of a shame I can't get home to see my family more often though.

[name="Diary"]     I never thought about it.
[name="Diary"]     After that, we headed back to camp, and the rest of the expedition proceeded without incident.
[name="Diary"]     But on the way back, I began to think about something I had never realized was wrong.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Well.... Of course, I actually slept about half the trip.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     On the way to the village, I even fell asleep in the middle of the road.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     But to make for an easier read, I will omit those details.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     Since joining Rhine Lab and transferring to Rhodes Island...?

[name="Ptilopsis"]     Ifrit, what are you doing here?
[Character(name="char_134_ifrit_5#1")]
[name="Ifrit"]     Silence is busy in the lab. I heard you were back so I came to see you.
[name="Ifrit"]     It's like, since you're pretty much always here, it was a lot weirder to have you gone. I'm used to Silence being out.
[name="Ifrit"]     I'm so glad you're back!
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Indeed, I rarely go out.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     ...Indeed, I rarely go out.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Why'd you say that twice, Ptilopsis?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     It just occurred to me that I don't actually go outside very often.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Huh? Did you hit your head out there?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     No, it was just some unknown error in the system. It has been fixed.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     I bought some Kazimierz goods. They're over there.

[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     No.

[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Good.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     There is a storybook on the shelf. You can read it over there. I'm going to write something.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Sweet!
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Phew.... Now then.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     It's been a long time since I joined Rhine Lab and moved to Rhodes Island.
[name="Diary"]     I'm completely used to the way things are now and subconsciously consider it normal.
[name="Diary"]     But this trip made me realize that's not the case.
[name="Diary"]     Not that I reject the life I lead. I have just suddenly become aware of this problem.
[name="Diary"]     That is, I am myself quite far from normal.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Is 'normal' the correct word here? Is it my life that is abnormal?
[name="Ptilopsis"]     ...Broadly speaking, I suppose it is.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     And I simply forget.
[name="Diary"]     Even I have a hard time describing what Oripathy has taken from me and given to me.
[name="Diary"]     I can manage that once Silence worked out a treatment plan for me at Rhine Lab, research and sleep gradually took over my entire life.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     My body doesn't allow me to do time-consuming work, let alone leave the facility.
[name="Ptilopsis"]     I am self-conscious about my condition, so even on the rare occasions that I do go outside, I do not move about so freely.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     For as long as I can remember, all my knowledge of the outside world has come almost entirely from the descriptions of my colleagues, various documents, and the unchanging view outside my window.
[name="Diary"]     Now that I think about it, it's only natural that I would aspire to be like Gavial and Ansel.
[name="Diary"]     But before today, I did not realize why.
[name="Diary"]     Because I can't help but compartmentalize myself when people discuss their lives.
[name="Diary"]     I can engage with their topics, but I subconsciously think I don't belong in them.
[Character(name="char_134_ifrit_5#1")]
[name="Ifrit"]     Ptilopsis, what are you writing? Doesn't look like a report to me.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     A diary.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     A diary? Oh, Silence told me to keep one, but it was a huge pain!
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     True, it is a lot of work to write every day, but it is necessary for me.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Why?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     To keep myself from forgetting.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Why do you forget?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Because I am forgetful.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Um.... Don't get it.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     It is better if you don't.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Oh.... Can I see it?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     You can. But it is all text. I don't think you will like it.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Yeah, screw it. I'll go back to my storybook.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Right.

[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_108_silent_1",focus=2)]
[name="Silence"]     Huh? Ah, no.
[name="Silence"]     I'm just trying to figure out what to get Ifrit for her birthday. It's coming up.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_108_silent_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     A birthday present?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_108_silent_1",focus=2)]
[name="Silence"]     Yes. It needs to be fireproof, and it needs to be something she likes. Ugh, a child's mind is so unpredictable.
[name="Silence"]     I should just make something myself.

[name="Silence"]     What?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_108_silent_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Nothing. I was just pondering how even Silence thinks about such things.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_108_silent_1",focus=2)]
[name="Silence"]     Is it that strange? Well... maybe it's a bit unlike me.
[name="Silence"]     But since I decided to take Ifrit with me, these things are my responsibility.

[name="Ptilopsis"]     Even Silence, who can bury herself in her work for days on end, has such a side to her.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     I understand that this is my own problem.
[name="Diary"]     Or should I say, it was not a problem to begin with.
[name="Diary"]     I don't feel so bad, because I do not dislike this researcher's life.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     On the other hand, if I hated research, I wouldn't have joined Rhine Lab at all.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     Whether at Rhine Lab or Rhodes Island, I have seen countless people more miserable than I. And I'm lucky compared to them.
[name="Diary"]     And I believe that the research I'm doing is something meaningful.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     So, I'm not writing this as a lamentation, or to say that I've suddenly realized that I've been living the wrong kind of life.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     I just remembered the purpose of my diary.
[name="Diary"]     I hear strange noises from time to time, metal scraping, crashing, shouting, explosions.
[name="Diary"]     It's like these voices are coming from deep inside me, haunting me.
[name="Diary"]     Sometimes when I wake up, I find myself in a sort of trance and I forget where I am and what I'm doing.
[name="Diary"]     Of course, I don't really forget, but there's no denying that I'll need more time and energy to remember than a normal person would.
[name="Diary"]     I started this diary just to ensure I did not forget something important.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Something important....
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Ptilopsis, why are you staring at me? And what have you been mumbling to yourself all this time?
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Nothing.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=2)]
[name="Ifrit"]     Did you get yourself into trouble? Do you need me to talk to Silence for you?
[name="Ifrit"]     I'll help you once, 'cause we're friends. You better not have done anything too bad. I don't need a spanking from Silence.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1",name2="char_134_ifrit_5#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     Hehe, don't worry.
[character]
[name="Diary"]     Today's encounter made me realize something.
[name="Diary"]     When it comes to the important things, just trying not to forget them isn't enough.
[name="Diary"]     Rather, I wish I could do more to understand the people I care about.
[Character(name="char_128_plosis_1")]
[name="Ptilopsis"]     I don't want to regret anything.
