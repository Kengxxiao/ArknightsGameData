[name="Hibiscus"]     Hey!
[name="Hibiscus"]     Look, Miss Perro, what do I have here?
[character]
[name="???"]     ?
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     It's your favorite, isn't it?
[name="Hibiscus"]     If you're a good girl and help me finish my exam....
[name="Hibiscus"]     These honey biscuits are all yours.
[character]
[name="???"]     (Sniffing)
[name="???"]     ........
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     That's weird. Why isn't she reacting to the honey biscuits?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]     There's something wrong with your recipe, Hibiscus.
[name="Lava"]     How many times have I told you not to put weird stuff in your food?
[name="Lava"]     You never listen.
[name="Lava"]     Here, little Perro, I'll give you this.
[character]
[name="What?"]     (Sniffing)
[name="???"]     Awoo.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]     But you have to be a good girl.
[character]
[name="???"]     Mmmm——
[name="???"]     Awoo.
[name="???"]     Ah——
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     It worked!
[name="Hibiscus"]     That's my little Lava. So reliable.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Too bad you're not.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Okay, let's proceed with the oral exam.
[name="Hibiscus"]     Swallow the crumbs, okay, and open wide...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Hey, Hibiscus?
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Watch your tongue, Miss Perro——Hm, what?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Why did we bring her back with us?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Because we felt bad for her. Her infection is very serious.
[name="Hibiscus"]     And the head of the Leithanian branch even said:
[name="Hibiscus"]     'It's a good thing you subdued her. There would have been no hope for her if the police or bounty hunters found her first.'
[name="Hibiscus"]     An Infected person as far gone as her, with the way the laws in Leithanien have changed, almost certainly would have been euthanized.'
[name="Hibiscus"]     If it's at all possible, please at least get her out of Leithanien's territory. Thank you.'
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Even if she wasn't Infected, the way she was just attacking people on the road would probably not have ended well for her.
[name="Lava"]     At least twenty-four groups of travelers got attacked before us. She hurt nearly a hundred people.
[name="Lava"]     And that's just in Leithanien. Who knows what she did anywhere else.
[name="Lava"]     Not to mention her fighting skills. I don't think the five of us could've pulled off attacks like that.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     But all she did was take some food. She was just hungry——Ow!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     She almost killed me!
[name="Lava"]     If Kroos wasn't looking out for me and Beagle wasn't so quick with her shield, this Perro would've crushed your little sister with that rock-covered javelin.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Miss Perro, please don't bite my hand!
[character]
[name="???"]     Waah.
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Okay, okay.
[name="Hibiscus"]     Your teeth are almost finished. Just a little longer. Hang in there!
[name="Hibiscus"]     Yeah. Good girl.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Come on, Lava, don't be like that.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Like what? I'm just stating facts.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     What's with you all of a sudden? Getting pissy about every little thing.
[name="Hibiscus"]     I thought you loved Miss Perro?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Yeah, she's great. She loves me too.
[name="Lava"]     That's why she threw all kinds of rocks and flames and ice and pretty much everything at me.
[name="Lava"]     How did she master so many different complex Arts anyway?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1")]
[name="Lava"]     Hey, little Perro. Are you sure you've never studied Originium Arts?
[character]
[name="???"]     Ooh?
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Heyyy, I told you not to move——Lava, quit screwing around!

[name="Lava"]     I'm just asking...

[name="Hibiscus"]     LA——VA——!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     All right, all right. My bad. Whatever.
[character]
[name="???"]     Mmm?
[Character(name="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Ah, sorry, Miss Perro, just a little longer.
[name="Hibiscus"]     And now here, and here.

[name="Hibiscus"]     Whew. And that should be it.
[name="Hibiscus"]     Now, Miss Perro, we're pretty much done. Rinse your mouth with this glass of water, and be sure to spit it out. Don't swallow.
[character]
[name="???"]     Mmm.
[name="???"]     (Gulp.)
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Little Lava.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Something's bothering you.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     None of your business.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     You were the first one in the squad to give her something nice to eat.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     What's that got to do with anything?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     After starving for that long, she shouldn't be consuming much sugar, from a nutritional standpoint. But she really needs to supplement pretty much everything at this point.
[name="Hibiscus"]     That's why...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Wait....
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     You snuck off and bought a bunch of candy.
[name="Hibiscus"]     Only later realizing you'd spent all your money.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     That's enough...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Or when we were bringing Miss Perro back, everyone was worried she'd run off.
[name="Hibiscus"]     Only you were brave enough to try to communicate with her, building the trust we needed to take off her shackles.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Ugh...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     And once we learned she liked honey biscuits, it was you, among the five of us, who worked the hardest to make the best ones.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Seriously, stop!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Your big sister is very proud of you.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Come on, don't talk about this stuff in front of her!
[name="Lava"]     I- I just did what I had to do.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     But it's so sweet. No need to hide it. Hehe.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Oh yeah!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     What?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     So, um, the, like, oral exam, that's the last part, right?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Yes.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     And then, um, what happens to her?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Well...
[name="Hibiscus"]     That's not up to us.
[name="Hibiscus"]     The operators responsible for that are still talking over her case. Orchid said she'd have someone tell us in the afternoon.
[name="Hibiscus"]     Anyway, after a busy morning and all those examinations, it's time to find a place for Miss Perro to——
[character]
[name="Beagle"]     Hibiscus, Lava! Are you still not done checking out Miss Perro? If we don't leave now, we'll miss Dobermann's training! I'm going on ahead!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1")]
[name="Lava & Hibiscus"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Hibiscus?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Oh, what?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     I thought you said got us out of Dobermann's class!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Huh? Uh, well....
[name="Hibiscus"]     I, er, I might have forgot...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Why didn't you say so earlier?
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     All I could think about at the time was helping Miss Perro with her checkup...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     We're dead.
[name="Lava"]     Let's go pick out a pair of coffins.
[name="Lava"]     What are we gonna do?!
[name="Lava"]     Okay, how about we take little Perro out now and give her to the first person who comes along? I just hope we can find them again after training.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     That plan is a little...
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     Let's see you come up with one!
[name="Lava"]     I'm not running laps around the bridge again.
[name="Lava"]     And I bet you don't want to memorize anatomy textbooks while doing jumping jacks either.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     Who would?!
[name="Hibiscus"]     Okay, fine. We'll do it your way.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     I'll get her weapons. You deal with her.
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=2)]
[name="Hibiscus"]     B- but what about her mouthwash——
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1",name2="char_120_hibisc_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]     She already swallowed it!
[name="Lava"]     Hurry!

[name="Ceobe"]     And... and...
[name="Ceobe"]     And I want a big house where I can keep all my treasures.

[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     How do you think?
[name="HR Director"]     Fancy a guess?
[name="HR Director"]     She doesn't take orders. She just throws her weapons around and makes a scene.

[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Just tell me her results.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]      Her results. Heh.
[name="HR Director"]      ........
[name="HR Director"]      She passed.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Oh.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]      She made a mess of herself and failed a bunch of tests. But her personal character and potential qualify her to be an operator.
[name="HR Director"]     And, taking into account the opinions of several of her proctors, the other details are less important.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     The Doctor is never wrong about anyone.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     Neither are you.
[name="HR Director"]     Well then, it's time.
[name="HR Director"]      Can I get a reason now?
[name="HR Director"]      Normally, the operator assessment process is initiated by the individual herself.
[name="HR Director"]     We typically look poorly on situations where an individual has the decision made for her. Especially when there is no guardian or relative involved.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Sorry.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     That's all I get?
[name="HR Director"]     Ah well, it's not that big a deal. Rules were made to be broken.
[name="HR Director"]     Just give me a reason. I have to pass something upstairs.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     A girl who likes weapons can't be bad.

[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Yes.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     I'm gonna need a little more than that. A few more sentences or there's no way I can finish this report.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     I have to?
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     It's important.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Well....
[name="Vulcan"]     I'm a blacksmith. I don't know people. But I do know weapons.
[name="Vulcan"]     If you have someone with absolutely no knowledge of weapon maintenance and upkeep,
[name="Vulcan"]     her weapons are going to get damaged after a long period of use.
[name="Vulcan"]     Still, she did her best to keep her equipment in good shape, to the best of her abilities.
[name="Vulcan"]     That was enough for me to affirm her talent and potential.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     How can you be sure she doesn't know weapon maintenance?
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     She can't use a whetstone, she doesn't know her oils. That's long before we start talking about any rules or scientific principles.
[name="Vulcan"]     The only thing she knows how to do is polish her weapons. And she's good at that.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     Okay. What else?
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     That should be enough.
[name="Vulcan"]     You know better than me what has to go on a resume.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     I do.
[name="HR Director"]     She's a Bolívarian, traveled the whole world looking for Minos, and never quite found it.
[name="HR Director"]     Still don't get why.
[name="HR Director"]      All I can say is her spirit is commendable.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     It's always good to have faith.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     That's what I'm curious about.
[name="HR Director"]     You usually don't pay much attention to people.
[name="HR Director"]     This Ceobe, is she that special?
[name="HR Director"]      What is it about her that caught your attention?
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Her weapons.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     I'm serious, Vulcan.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     I'm serious too.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     How so?
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     Her name was carved into that axe.
[name="Vulcan"]     Minos isn't Higashi. We don't just tape our names onto weapons in case we lose them.
[name="Vulcan"]     If your name is on a weapon, it means something big.
[name="Vulcan"]     Plus,
[name="Vulcan"]     I couldn't forge that axe.
[name="Vulcan"]     But that technique, I know I've seen it somewhere...
[name="Vulcan"]     I want to help her solve the mystery of that weapon.
[name="Vulcan"]     Then, maybe someday, she'll come back and solve something for me.
[name="Vulcan"]     I guess you could say I'm just a selfish blacksmith.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     ?
[name="HR Director"]     Hmmm....
[name="HR Director"]     You craftsmen have your secrets.
[name="HR Director"]      Well, whatever.
[name="HR Director"]     That's enough for me.
[name="HR Director"]     Sorry to bother you. Go get some rest.
[Character(name="char_163_hpsts_1")]
[name="Vulcan"]     I'm sorry too.
[Character]
[name="HR Director"]     No need. I'm just doing my job here.

[name="Logistics Operator"]     Understood.
[name="HR Director"]     Just a moment. Be sure operator Vulcan is there for that. She may be needed to explain some of the formal terms and conditions.
[name="Logistics Operator"]     Understood.
[name="HR Director"]     Okay, enough chatter, back to work.
[name="HR Director"]     ........(flipping through new operator files)
[name="HR Director"]     Heh.
[name="HR Director"]     Sure enough.
[name="HR Director"]     Another one who can't write a CV worth a damn.
[name="HR Director"]     Looks like I'm in for another long evening.
