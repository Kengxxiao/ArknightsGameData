[name="Logistics Operator"]     Good work, Orchid.

[name="Orchid"]     I've gotten to know you all so well. It's like I'm part of the team now, huh?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     Ha... I'm better at this than looking after the circus, that's for sure.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]     Why don't you apply for a transfer to logistics then?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]     You know, people like you who come out of the, uh, more normal world usually end up working in logistics. It's kind of unusual to become a combat operator.
[name="Logistics Operator"]     We've all been wondering why you decided to go to the front lines, actually.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]

[name="Logistics Operator"]     What kind of work would you like to do for Rhodes Island, Orchid?
[name="Logistics Operator"]     The assessments show you have an aptitude for Originium Arts. If you're interested, we could put you on the front lines.
[name="Logistics Operator"]     But since you are a civilian with no relevant combat experience, we still recommend that you join a logistics-related section.
[name="Logistics Operator"]     Of course, rest assured that even if you go into a combat role, we won't put you in danger. No more than you can handle, anyway.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     What does logistics do?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]     Well... It's a pretty broad department with a lot of functions. But, in general, you can think of it as the jobs that keep Rhodes Island running.
[name="Logistics Operator"]     Since there are more clerical jobs, it's well suited to people like you. Folks used to city life.

[name="Logistics Operator"]     'Combat operators of civilian origin who, within one year of working as a combat operator, find themselves unsuited to the role, may apply for reclassification as a logistics operator. It will be unconditionally approved.'
[name="Logistics Operator"]     You haven't been here that long, so you should be good to go. Actually, everyone in A6 should be good. Except Spot, since he was a Sargon soldier.
[name="Logistics Operator"]     And even with Spot, I bet we can find a little wiggle room. 
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator"]     It's not like our work is any easier than that of a combat operator. Rhodes Island depends on us to keep moving.

[name="Orchid"]     What? Bought?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Yeah. I used to work in a lumberyard.
[name="Popukar"]     One day, Dr. Ansel and Dr. Kal'tsit were passing by there and saw me. They played with me all day.

[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Yes. My mom and dad sent me to work in the lumberyard when I was very young. The boss was sometimes very mean to me. But at least he fed me...
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Oh, no.... The boss said my mom and dad went very far away and couldn't come to see me. So I just had to wait.
[name="Popukar"]     Then Dr. Ansel said that if I was good, Rhodes Island would help me find my mom and dad, and I might see them again someday!
[name="Popukar"]     Hey, Orchid, why are you hugging me all of a sudden? What's wrong?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2",name2="char_281_popka_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     ...Nothing. Sometimes a girl needs hugs is all.
[name="Orchid"]     How would you like to be like those boys and girls back there? Doing things in a chair, not needing to run around all the time?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#2",name2="char_281_popka_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Um, Dr. Ansel asked me the same question, but I don't really understand that kind of stuff. I just know I'm pretty strong.
[name="Popukar"]     But I've been trying really hard to learn to read. Then I can help you, and all those boys and girls in the office!
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1#6",focus=1)]

[name="Catapult"]     I didn't have anything to do today, so he roped me in, worked my tail off, and finally let me go. Spot's there giving him the business now.

[name="Orchid"]     Why?
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]     How should I know? I figured you'd be up on it. I just know I need to steer clear of Midnight around ten o'clock.
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     I knew about it! Midnight also got me to join. But then I hit him and he flew away and he didn't ask me again.
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]     Bwahahahahaha! So that's the story. No wonder he dodged the question when I asked if he told you. Hahaha! My sides!
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]     Why do you always come back to that?! This is discrimination, Orchid. You're always so nice to Popukar, even when she makes trouble!
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     I'd be so nice to you if you'd also go and sweetly apologize every time you did something bad.
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]     That's beyond me. And if I have to apologize for stirring things up, then where's the fun in it?!
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     Just stay out of trouble to begin with!
[name="Orchid"]     You're lucky you're at Rhodes Island, anywhere else would have... Never mind. Forget it.
[Character(name="char_282_catap_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Catapult"]     Come on, Orchid, just come out with it. Nowhere else can handle my personality. And I don't wanna change. Only Rhodes Island would want a freak like me!

[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ...Fair enough.
[name="Orchid"]     But we're normal people. And Instructor Dobermann made it clear that civilian teams like us won't ever end up on dangerous missions. So what's the point?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Oh, good question. Mm, a truly fantastic question, Orchid.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     .......?

[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     What are you talking about?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     That's a rhetorical question, to start things off. I can continue without an answer.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     I'd guess the trick is to be handsome, first and foremost. And then be a decent talker?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     No, no, and no. Although I consider myself quite beautiful, and I do know how to pay a compliment...
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1")]
[name="Spot"]     Bleh.
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     What's wrong with Spot?
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=1)]
[name="Spot"]     Nothing, just looking at a clown in a whole new light.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Heh heh. Confidence is very important. But by far the most important is to treat all your clients equally.
[name="Midnight"]     That is——When you step into my realm, my presence, then, whoever you are, the only thing you are, is my client.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ........What's the point of all this? Are you trying to say that everyone's the same to you?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Not at all, my dear sweet captain. Clever as you are, you've never thought this through.
[name="Midnight"]     It's not that everyone's the same to me. It's that, simply, everyone's the same.
[name="Midnight"]     The iron-fisted career woman, tyrant of her office section, could actually just be wearing a mask for the sake of her work. If she wears it long enough, she may forget how to take it back off.
[name="Midnight"]     The outwardly homely housewife, whose husband likely cheated on her long ago, she stays at home telling no one of her troubles, with no choice but to come to drink with me.
[name="Midnight"]     An ill-tempered fashion designer with her strong woman facade may just fear the gossip of others, and the resulting loss of trust.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     Do you have a death wish?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Ha ha, did you think I was talking about you? People like this abound.
[name="Midnight"]     Everyone in the city, after unloading their identities and responsibilities, is exactly the same. Each and every one.
[name="Midnight"]     So why, at Rhodes Island, would things be any different?
[name="Midnight"]     Do the elite operators who go diving headlong into a warzone, come back and unplug themselves like so much machinery?
[name="Midnight"]     No, they drink and chat in the bar. They care for their freshly potted plants in the greenhouse. They listen to music, they read.
[name="Midnight"]     They complain when a mission is too hard, or chuckle at how hilariously easy it was. They cry, they laugh, they mope, they hurt, and they die.
[name="Midnight"]     They're no different from us, are they?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ...You're a boy who knows how to give a speech.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ...*Sigh*. That all makes sense. But I still feel like it's not completely true.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     And I can't blame you for that. My industry, as it is, always had a bit of an underbelly to it. I have that advantage.
[name="Midnight"]     But not you, Orchid. You grew up entirely in the light of day.
[name="Midnight"]     The greatest hardships for you were lower pay than you'd like, insufficiently clear skin, traffic on your commute. Those sorts of things.
[name="Midnight"]     This world of violence and bloodshed is indeed a brave new world for you.
[name="Midnight"]     But you're here. You made your choice. Shouldn't you at least try to understand it instead of shackling yourself to the common sense of your past?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     The common sense of my past...
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     I'm not trying to be preachy. I'm definitely not qualified to preach. But wouldn't the 'fashion guru' of Rhodes Island understand that?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     Even you know about that, huh?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     I've talked to quite a few senior operators. I've heard a lot of interesting stories.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     And you're getting in good with them?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     I get in good with anyone, as long as they understand my language. This is my special power as the Devil of the Eastern Night.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     Right.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     So you know perfectly well that the people who ask you to design their outfits and give fashion tips are ordinary people like us, don't you?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ........
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1")]
[name="Midnight"]     By the way, Spot. You asked me why I knew how to fight when I was just an 'escort.'
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     Huh? Ah, oh yeah, I forgot.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     You wound me. This is a bit of a story, so let's take it to the cafeteria. My treat.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     Sounds like a pain in the ass. Can I pass? I don't really care.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Heh heh. I'm afraid not.

[name="Midnight"]     Ahem, right, back to business then.
[name="Midnight"]     First of all, if I may be so bold as to ask, Orchid, how did you contract Oripathy? If that's too personal a question, you don't have to answer.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ........It's not a great story. Just one day I suddenly noticed a little crystalline growth on my body.
[name="Orchid"]     The doctors said I must have been exposed to some Originium without even knowing. I still don't know exactly how I got it.
[name="Orchid"]     That's it.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Ah, I see. No wonder you're having this little crisis.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1")]
[name="Midnight"]     So, let me tell you my experience.
[name="Midnight"]     There was a younger man working in my club.
[name="Midnight"]     He was my polar opposite: bright, sunny disposition, straightforward. Instantly likeable.
[name="Midnight"]     Of course, no one who works in my industry could be called naive. But if I'm the type to make malicious assumptions about people, he's the type to trust them.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     Sounds like the type I would hate.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Is that your way of saying you like me, Spot?
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Spot"]     Orchid, is there really no cure for narcissism?
[Character(name="char_284_spot_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     I'll ask Medical later. Maybe there's hope.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1")]
[name="Midnight"]     Heh heh. As I said before, I treat all my clients equally. Meaning I don't change my approach based on one's status or identity.
[name="Midnight"]     I make an active effort towards that goal. But for him, it was second nature.
[name="Midnight"]     From my position atop the industry, I could see that he would be the one to surpass me.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     So that person surpassed Midnight?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]     ........It can't be that simple.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1")]
[name="Popukar"]     Huh?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3")]
[name="Midnight"]     ........Yeah, it would be nice if that was the whole story.
[name="Midnight"]     Now that I think about it, I actually did him a disservice. He didn't come from a good family. He needed the money. To him, I must've looked like the king of the world.
[name="Midnight"]     If I was out of his way, he would have been able to make it in that world. 
[name="Midnight"]     I should have taught him much earlier how to situate himself, how to handle money, and how to be what people needed him to be.
[name="Midnight"]     Had I done that, maybe we wouldn't have ended up at each other's throats.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     He was jealous of you? And you didn't notice?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     ........He hid it well. Or rather, he didn't even notice it himself.
[name="Midnight"]     It wasn't until he almost killed me the first time that I realized this flaw in my understanding of human nature.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     I think it's got nothing to do with human nature. You're just too nice.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     Right? I never thought of you as the type to mentor a newbie.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     But Midnight is a really good man! I always knew!
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Thank you, Popukar.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     But you said 'first time,' which means there was a second time.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Right.
[name="Midnight"]     He did almost kill me the first time. Almost. I'm confident, had that been his second attempt to kill a man, I wouldn't be sitting here.
[name="Midnight"]     But I am.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     I bet five Lungmen dollars you bitched out.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     No. I didn't. It's just... I couldn't have expected what happened next.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4")]
[name="Midnight"]     At the time, I saw the world as Orchid does. I never thought of it as a place of malice and bloodshed.
[name="Midnight"]     I muscled him out of the industry and learned how to handle a sword. I thought that would be enough. I really did.
[name="Midnight"]     Until one day, I discovered a health problem.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     Your Oripathy....
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4")]
[name="Midnight"]     He paid my agent to infect me somehow.
[name="Midnight"]     The second time he came looking for me, he was Infected himself. And he brought his 'friends' with him.
[name="Midnight"]     I had seen a lot of hate in my work. I thought I understood it. But when it was actually directed at me, I felt it burning in a way I hadn't ever before imagined.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     But you won.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#4",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     I did. Even if I can't go toe to toe with you, I can fight off a dozen thugs and walk away with my life.
[name="Midnight"]     It was then, with my own hands, I took his...
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1")]
[name="Popukar"]     Waaaaaaahhhhhh!
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1#2",focus=1)]

[name="Popukar"]     Poor Midniiiiiiight! Waaaaahhh...
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1")]
[name="Midnight"]     Don't cry, Popukar.
[name="Midnight"]     Honestly, I should thank him for showing me how immature I was.
[name="Midnight"]     After that, I learned about a place called Rhodes Island and made up my mind to leave the industry and come all the way here after registering with the office in Higashi.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Along the way, I saw a lot, and thought a lot more. I came to Rhodes Island with a deep understanding of this one thing.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     What are you looking at?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     Let me share my thoughts with you, Orchid.
[name="Midnight"]     I'm not trying to say that because we've seen the cruel reality of the world here, we need to accept it.
[name="Midnight"]     From our point of view, it's only natural to think that most of Rhodes Island's operators have been through unnecessary pain.
[name="Midnight"]     We shouldn't feel inferior for having grown up in our relative safety, but it isn't an excuse for us to fight it either.
[name="Midnight"]     Life is the same everywhere.
[name="Midnight"]     Where we used to live, the only way to get what we wanted was to work hard and earn money. It's actually the same here.
[name="Midnight"]     We could have chosen to join the logistics department and put in the same effort there. But I chose the path of war.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ........Aren't you afraid to die?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     I think we're all afraid to die.
[name="Midnight"]     But as you've learned in your time here, Orchid, sooner or later you have to fight to defend something.
[name="Midnight"]     This would be a fine time to say 'I'm training hard so I can be strong to defend you, Orchid,' but I'd like you to think about something instead——
[name="Midnight"]     What kind of life do you want to lead at Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#3",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]
[name="Orchid"]     ........I understand.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#2")]
[name="Popukar"]     Um... but I don't...
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#2",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=2)]
[name="Spot"]     Good. This is something you'll never have to worry about. Why not eat up instead? Here, you can have mine.
[Character(name="char_281_popka_1#4",name2="char_284_spot_1",focus=1)]
[name="Popukar"]     Wow, thanks Spot!
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1#2")]
[name="Midnight"]     Hehe. He's right. You don't have to worry about this stuff, Popukar.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=1)]
[name="Midnight"]     And forgive me for dumping all this on you, Orchid, but the question you asked me is one I've been asking myself a lot since I came to Rhodes Island. So I had a lot to say about it.
[Character(name="char_283_midn_1",name2="char_278_orchid_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#6",name2="char_281_popka_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     Not tonight. Midnight kept us out too late. 
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#6",name2="char_281_popka_1#6",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Oh....
[name="Popukar"]     Okay. I'm just glad to see you happy, Orchid.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1#6",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     Oh? Have I been unhappy lately?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Um, I don't know how to say this. But you seemed very upset after we left the logistics department. Not now though. Now you look happy.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     Did I...? I guess I did.
[name="Orchid"]     Thank you, Popukar.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1#4",name2="char_281_popka_1",focus=2)]
[name="Popukar"]     Did I do something?

[name="Orchid"]     Hehe. You just don't know it yet.

[name="???"]     Excuse me, are you Orchid?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1")]
[name="Orchid"]     Oh? You are...?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3")]
[name="Sora"]     I'm Sora, with Penguin Logistics. I've heard you're kind of an expert on fashion, and pretty handy with a needle and thread. Can I talk to you for a minute?

[name="Logistics Operator A"]     So you decided to carry on as a combat operator. That's too bad. But it's your call, Orchid. We'll respect it.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid."]     Yes. It may not be a good fit for me, but it's a special opportunity. I don't want to waste it.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator A"]     That's true. Sitting in the office all day is pretty boring.... Maybe I should apply for a transfer and try it out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Logistics Operator B."]     You're dreaming. You wouldn't last two seconds with Dobermann.
[Character(name="avg_npc_012",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator A"]     Oh yeah, I've heard about that one. It's pretty cool you made it through her training, Orchid.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     You get used to it... Anyway, that's all for today.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator A"]     Heading back so early?
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=1)]
[name="Orchid"]     Yeah, I have a thing.
[Character(name="char_278_orchid_1",name2="avg_npc_012",focus=2)]
[name="Logistics Operator A."]     Okay, see you tomorrow.
