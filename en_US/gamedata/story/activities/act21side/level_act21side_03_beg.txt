[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#5$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rubio"]That's true. Carracci was greatly concerned with the citizenry's well being, things such as food, water, and sanitation.
[name="Rubio"]But I don't think there's anything I can do to assist you.
[name="Rubio"]I never actually mingled my way into his innermost circle.
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#2$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#1$1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rubio"]You're asking too much. You understand what I'm saying, don't you?
[name="Rubio"]Your Honor... several other Ministri dei Lavori Pubblici died before Carracci. Do you remember them?
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#2$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rubio"]Seven? Or maybe eight?
[name="Rubio"]The people in those positions were just puppets. Each famiglia was trying to push their own people up there.
[name="Rubio"]But in the end, they were all taken out by other famiglie.
[name="Rubio"]When it came to a position as important as il Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici, though, I'll be blunt here, it was clear as day why the famiglie filled the position with a man as spotless as Carracci instead of installing one of their cronies.
[name="Rubio"]For one simple reason: if the killing continued, the construction of the city would grind to a halt.
[name="Rubio"]'If our people can't get in, then we'll at least make sure yours can't either.' That is why Carracci occupied that seat.
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#1$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rubio"]Make no mistake, he had close ties with the Bellones. The Don's son even sat beside him as his secretary. But, in one way or another, he was just as close with every other famiglia.
[name="Rubio"]There's an ancient Yan saying to the effect of 'he who walks oft along the river, inevitably finds his shoes wet,' yes? I have always trusted in Carracci's integrity, but so what? Others did not see it that way.
[name="Rubio"]The way Siracusans think, you either choose to be one famiglia's pet, or you choose to be another's.
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#2$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rubio"]In other words, Carracci's death was inevitable. He wasn't part of any of famiglia's vision for the future. Do you think he was oblivious to that fact?
[name="Rubio"]In the end, it doesn't matter whether he died today, a month ago, or a month from now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#2$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#6$1",focus=2)]
[name="Lavinia"]You know how much hard work he put in.
[Character(name="avg_npc_689_1#4$1",name2="avg_4065_judge_1#6$1",focus=1)]
[name="Rubio"]And what did he get for it in the end?
[name="Rubio"]Actually, let's assume he was as selfless a person as you say. What did the people he worked so hard for, those whom he so eloquently claimed as 'his dear citizens,' give him in the end?
