Leontuzzo forgot what happened that day.
He was still too young at the time.
He knows only two things for certain.
That day was not the day his mother died.
That day was the only time he ever saw his father look somewhat lost.
He walked through the rainy streets and saw his father sitting outside the church without an umbrella.
He tried to run over to hold up his umbrella for his father, but slipped and fell.
His father picked him up. The rain was heavier than usual that day. He could not clearly see his father's expression, but was still acutely aware of his father's chagrin.
He still remembers the question his father asked him at the time—
Would Siracusa be better off without the famiglie?

Texas knows why she has been hesitating.
She doesn't like to think, and that means when she encounters a situation in which she is forced to think, she plans everything to the letter in advance.
She anticipated this well before she ever set out on her trip to Siracusa.
She knew she would have to fight.
But, she believes that what she did in Lungmen was not fundamentally different from what she had done in Columbia or Siracusa.
She does not believe that her life in Lungmen is righteous, just as she does not believe that her life in Siracusa or Columbia was evil.
She has always dealt in the logistics of life and death.
She knew she would one day have to face the land of Siracusa.
But she had already made up her mind.
Just as she had once asked her grandfather this question:
'Isn't Siracusan morality just trampling on the lives of the people all the same?'
She even anticipated meeting up with old acquaintances like Giovanna.
She really did anticipate all of this.
And that's why she has been tossing and turning sleeplessly for several nights.
But the one thing she did not expect was that she would meet people here who wanted to change the place.
Leontuzzo—even though he is the heir to a famiglia, his way of thinking is progressive. His ideas may still be immature, but they are never violent.
Lavinia—a puppet of Signora Sicilia's will, but a judge who nevertheless wants the law to apply equally.
Carracci—even though she never met him, she learned from many sources that he served the people as Ministro dei Lavori Pubblici.
And finally—

The sounds of footsteps and screams gradually dissipate with Texas and Exusiai's departure, and the alley falls silent again.
Only the hollow laughter of the lone white wolf continues to reverberate.
Until she too stops laughing.
She turns her gaze in a certain direction. Not the one Texas left, but rather where Famiglia Saluzzo resides.

Lavinia walks out of the room.
The peal of that gunshot resounds through Volsinii. Even the dark clouds part for a few minutes as if spooked, letting a few strands of sunlight filter through, for the first time in ages.
Her agreement with Bernardo was once her only goal.
To the point that when she found out Bernardo had broken his promise, she didn't know what to do with herself.
But now, she knows.
Because she's been told she does not stand alone.
And the ones who told her made a sacrifice a hundred times more heroic than her struggles.
Compared to them, she might actually be the lucky one.
But she does not plan to stand by and rely on this luck.
[name="Lavinia"]......
[name="Lavinia"]Ministro Rubio, your sacrifice will not be in vain.
She strokes the codex in her hands, a few names from Rubio's diary still lingering in her head.
She has either seen them before, or heard of them.
This is the most bountiful legacy that Rubio has left behind for her.
