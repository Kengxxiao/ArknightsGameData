Lavinia's mind races with the details of the latest case as she makes her way back to the courthouse.
She knows full well what looms overhead, but everyone here, including herself, takes it for granted.
At the entrance to the courthouse, Lavinia looks over at her car, and cannot help but let out a sigh.
It has been splashed with paint, and now stands out conspicuously among its neighbors.
A simple gesture of malice.
These acts used to make her feel at a loss for words, but now they trouble her no more than the continuous drizzle.
Of course, there is still the cost of getting the car cleaned.

[name="Leontuzzo"]Try to settle things with them directly? They're not stupid enough to give the game away.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Despite the not-insignificant amount of power and influence we have here, there is nothing we can do about them.

[name="Leontuzzo"]I believe that you, having spent a number of years living in Lungmen, should be more familiar with their way of doing things.

[name="Texas"]...To the point I almost thought I was back in Lungmen.

[name="Leontuzzo"]Hah. But here in Siracusa, few people even realize how big the shockwaves from the Columbian approach might end up being.
[name="Leontuzzo"]You know, Signorina Texas, when I really dove into the nitty-gritty of this approach, to better understand it, the only thing I felt was...
[name="Leontuzzo"]Admiration.
[name="Leontuzzo"]The weapons they deploy are profits and negotiations, not violence and bloodshed.
[Character(name="avg_1028_texas2_1#1$1",name2="avg_427_vigil_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]So you also studied their methods.

[name="Leontuzzo"]Studied? No... I'll do it better than them.
[name="Leontuzzo"]And Carracci is my trump card.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Recently, there's been a sudden outbreak of assassinations on government officials around the city. Though I haven't confirmed who's behind the attacks yet, I must ensure the safety of Ministro Carracci.
[name="Leontuzzo"]He's an interesting man, and prefers to walk over taking the car. Even though I have people protecting him in secret, I do not feel at ease.
[name="Leontuzzo"]Now, I've already given them a heads up. Go bring him over to the banquet venue.
