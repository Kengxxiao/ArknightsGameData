[name="Worker A"]What?
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=1)]
[name="Worker B"]...To be honest, when I was drafting this proposal, it felt like there was one issue that couldn't be resolved internally, so that needs to be brought up at the meeting for the boss to discuss with the mayor.
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=2)]
[name="Worker A"]Which issue?
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=1)]
[name="Worker B"]It's hard to say, but let me explain first.
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=1)]
[name="Worker B"]You see, we proposed a plate-by-plate migration model for this relocation, with the key technical and managerial personnel for each plate going first.
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=1)]
[name="Worker B"]Their numbers are small enough for us to manage, and they've already completed the move. Once they assume their posts in the core sector, we can start preparing to move the rest of the population.
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=1)]
[name="Worker B"]The fixed demand treats each plate as a unit, with each unit moving in sequence. However, all the proposals made so far fail to provide enough transportation capacity, even if we bring in external logistics companies.
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=2)]
[name="Worker A"]I see. So?
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=2)]
[name="Worker A"]Ideas on their own are worthless without plans. How are you going to deal with this issue?
[character(name="avg_npc_020",name2="avg_npc_020",focus=2)]
[name="Worker A"]I hope you're not planning to bring it up at the meeting just to let the Bureau of Administration and Transport worry about it.

[name="Eurill"] Mr. Herman... I can truly see now that you're not just a mayor, but a father as well.

[name="Eurill"] Haha, no point in crying over a bit of spilled wine. Happens all the time.

[name="Eurill"] I'll pour you some more. As long as you don't drop the glass itself, that is.

[name="Herman"]I don't even know how long it's been since I've held out my glass like this. What if my hand shakes and I end up breaking it?

The two men raised their glasses and looked out across the scenery before them.
The sun was setting, but the surface of the ocean glimmered even more brightly than it had during the day.
