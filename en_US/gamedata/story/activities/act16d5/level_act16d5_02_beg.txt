[name="Lava"]Could we trouble you to tell us about the culture and customs here? To be honest, this place isn't where we thought we were going. It seems we went astray, and we're sort of at a loss.
[name="Lava"]For... for example, tell us about this village?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]Ah... there is much to tell of the origins of P'o-shan Village. Story has it that seventy years ago, a great fire started on a rich merchant's property, bringing untold calamity.
[name="Storyteller"]The rich merchant was frightened, and planned to leave, to find a place where nature blessed treasured lands, so he could live out the rest of his days.
[name="Storyteller"]Subsequently, in the midst of all the ashes, the people of his village found a peculiar painting on the ground...
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Painting?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]Correct. The house had burned to the ground, yet that painting scroll remained unharmed, and after brushing off the ash, it was as good as new.
[name="Storyteller"]The merchant heard of the painting, dove deep into his pockets to buy it back once again, seeking good luck to ward against fires.
[name="Storyteller"]In his new residence, the more the merchant gazed into the scenery in the painting, the more he took an interest. He sent out hundreds of servants in search of the marvelous feng shui this scroll had portrayed—
[name="Storyteller"]—and so came here, and so this village, and this garden came to be.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Was that your ancestor?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]Not so, not so. The world's affairs are never constant. Decades in the past, after the merchant's death, his few sons in their incompetence frittered away the household's wealth.
[name="Storyteller"]By chance, my father had some spare money from a string of opportune coincidences, and so bought the gardens and settled down here.
[name="Storyteller"]Afterwards, as nearby Catastrophes were infrequent and the mountains and rivers gorgeous, many talented scholars were drawn here, and over time, P'o-shan Village became as it is today.
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#1",name2="char_1011_purgatory_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"](I mean, it sounds wonderful.)
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#1",name2="char_1011_purgatory_1#1",focus=2)]
[name="Lava"](No issues with it yet, I think...)
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]So, the color of the sky...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]The what?
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Uh, I mean, daytime and nighttime seem to be mixed together...
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]We've always worked as the sun rose, and rested as it set. What doubts might you have?
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]It's been two hours since the bell sounded... with the twelve-branch double-hour system, it'd be one of those. The sun's hasn't moved at all. What's causing that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#1")]
[name="Storyteller"]The sun? Move?
[name="Storyteller"]The sun and moon sit in the sky, sun in the east, moon in the west, eternally unchanging. What other position would they assume?
[name="Storyteller"]Hm? You all have a peculiar look on your faces. Have I said something improper?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#3")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Er, benefactors, if I could interrupt, just very quickly.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]May I dare ask, will you again be telling stories here the next day?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=2)]
[name="Storyteller"]Naturally.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]As that is the case tomorrow, I presume yesterday you also took up your hand fan and gavel block?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=2)]
[name="Storyteller"]I lay at home, with the collection of strange tales as my one and only hobby, naught but the art of storytelling to pass the time. Thus, every day, in the two afternoon hours of the Monkey, changing for nothing.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Err. Then with the sun and moon constant above, and 'today, the next day, and yesterday,' how should you define what one 'day' is?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=2)]
[name="Storyteller"]You're quite the jokester, Brother No. Twelve earthly branches make up one day. Need you ask?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Erm... do the twelve branches and the twenty-four hours not track the time over one day and night?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=2)]
[name="Storyteller"]Hmm? How mystifying. I wonder just where you all came from? The twelve branches indicate the necessary periods between the sun rising above the earth in the far east, and the moon above the mountains in the far west, don't they?
[name="Storyteller"]Of course, they also indicate how this road is partitioned. East to west, P'o-shan Village lies from the late-morn sixth to the late-eve twelfth.
[name="Storyteller"]I've heard tell of mountains beyond mountains. Could it be that beyond Mount Hung-tung and downstream of the Tung-shêng River, other places are not so?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#3",name2="avg_npc_138#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Then... suppose P'o-shan Village alone occupies such a vast domain; if there are villages elsewhere, mightn't they be forever without daylight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#1")]
[name="Kroos"]Or they'd be stuck in the day, and they'd never even sleep properly. Sucks to be them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#1")]
[name="Storyteller"]This... this, I am truly unclear on.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Have you never left this village before? Aren't there any other travelers here?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]I never have. Very few people have ever come here, and of the youth that leave, very few ever return.
[name="Storyteller"]I must confess, the 'Yan' we presently know is from the library the rich merchant left behind, and nothing more.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Has a Catastrophe never struck this place before?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#4")]
[name="Storyteller"]They're just as rare. At least apart from the ancient records, our three generations have never seen one before.
[name="Storyteller"]And so, we hardly leave the bounds of P'o-shan Village. And just as you see, scarcely any travelers come here, let alone any officials or Messengers or other such persons.
[name="Storyteller"]To say P'o-shan Village is presently cut off from the outside world would be no exaggeration at all. That said, only when you disregard the affairs of the world can you be content.

[name="Lava"]And the monsters?
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#2")]
[name="Storyteller"]Ah... I know not when it began. Come every Dusk Ridding, Mount Hung-tung often bears monsters that come to disturb the village, over perhaps three to five days. For so many unbroken years, it has been this way.
[name="Storyteller"]In these years, I've turned every record over, asked the very few strangers whenever I could, and I've never found any way to address it...
[Character(name="avg_npc_138#1")]
[name="Storyteller"]But as long as you hide somewhere the sun is, those monsters won't come near.
[name="Storyteller"]Versus braving the dangers and battling them 'til one side is dead, much better is finding peace and safety, hiding under the sun, passing not a night and staying vigil throughout...
[name="Storyteller"]Over time, it's become a usual practice of ours here.

[name="Mr. Nothing"]Dear me! And I thought this place was a true peach-blossom utopia! I hadn't imagined such troubles here... Those monsters are much too frightening. To give them a wide berth is the sensible thing!
