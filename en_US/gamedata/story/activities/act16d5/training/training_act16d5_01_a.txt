[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_lava2")] Huh? Is that Melantha? Why is Melantha here? She can't withstand that many enemies!

Chill out, chill... look at those enemies. See their <@tu.kw>black and white</> coloring? That's how you tell if they're <@tu.kw>'Hui' or 'Ming'</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_lava2")] Nian?! What are you doing here?
[Tutorial(focusX=-255, focusY=230, focusWidth=80, focusHeight=80, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \

Now pay attention to this tile. It's called a <@tu.kw>'Mark of Hui and Ming,'</> and Operators <@tu.kw>deployed</> on it will gain an <@tu.kw>identical</> 'Ming' or 'Hui' attribute.
