[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]

[name="Lava"]Maybe we've already found the right place.
[name="Lava"]I should've figured this out sooner. Damn it, Nian... She didn't tell us about this on purpose...
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#5")]
[name="Kroos"]She's probably worried we'd let something slip that would tip Dusk off and let her get away.

[name="Lava"]Anything we eat might as well be real, and not only that, the people here can actually hold a conversation. Is this supposed to mean anything?
[name="Lava"]If she's able to do all this with just Arts, then this sister of Nian's—
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#5")]
[name="Kroos"]You're right about that... I've seen lots of weird Originium Arts before, but this is maybe a little too out there.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6")]

[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Is that so? Here I was thinking that, of all the places I've visited, this P'o-shan has to be one of the simplest, most unassuming towns.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Where have you been...?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#3")]
[name="Saga"]Why, I could go all morning about this.
[name="Saga"]During my travels, I have come across many an odd character. I have met someone who would use ale as a blade and betake herself like lightning. I have also seen someone fight with the most peculiar style, able to swim up a waterfall.
[name="Saga"]I have met one so sagacious, he could write a poem in eight steps. Alas, he offended the wrong men, and practically had to bring with him his own coffin to his final audience with his liege.
[name="Saga"]I have seen the famed Boulder of Pei-Hsüan. According to legend, in eras past, the boulder sprang up from the ground, suspending in midair when an emperor of the past ascended to his throne.
[name="Saga"]At first, it was thought to portend the country's prosperous future under his rule, but it was also thought to mean he had a heavy load to bear, and was thus seen as an omen by many.
[name="Saga"]I have visited a mountain that scraped the skies, where, amidst the clusters of Originium left behind by Catastrophes, there stood solemnly a towering pine tree, reaching upwards, as though splitting the sea of clouds in twain.
[name="Saga"]I have seen many a blade piercing chessboards, books sauteed in woks. I have also met a woman of Yan performing the most extraordinary feat, forging a city all on her own. Yet, strangely, it was hazy in appearance, and she would only allow us to view the city from afar, not in its vicinity.
[name="Saga"]I would be remiss to forget the Yan emperor's close friend from faraway lands. He told the Lung of his journey to the west, and of the countless towns and cities his travels took him.
[name="Saga"]Each and every time he spoke, I could see the townscapes before my eyes!
[name="Saga"]—Anyway, I know a thing or two because I've seen a thing or two.
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Uhh, I know of this Boulder of Pei-Hsüan. I was under the impression it was destroyed years ago during a Catastrophe?
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#1")]
[name="Saga"]Exactly the one. I saw it float with my own eyes—
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#3")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]How many years ago was that?!

[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#3")]

[PlayMusic(intro="$bar_intro", key="$bar_loop", volume=0.4)]
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#5")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]No... my hometown is farther north. Just your regular small town.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]I had resigned myself to live a normal, uninteresting life as a plowboy. That summer, a few men from the cities came to our town, led by a fine, magnificent lady. She said I was the one they sought.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]I was just thirteen at the time. They brought me to Kou-wu to a martial arts school, the Liens, and she was its master.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]That's how I met my master, and all there was to it. I had room and board, and when I had the time, I could help out at construction sites and earn some coin to send to my family back home.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]I remained diligent over the past ten years, but never once did I think my master did me a favor for taking me in.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]I made it a point to rely on none but myself. I would rather go without a meal than be looked down upon by my master.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]But... she was getting on in years. I once thought her formidable, matchless, even. But she was seriously ill. Couldn't even get a decent night's sleep.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]That was when I came to realize I could stay there no longer. All my fellow disciples had left, and it was my time to do so as well.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]But... last year, I killed someone by accident. Someone whom I should not have killed.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]I thought it was a friendly match between dojos. It wasn't until much later that I found out the man had sold his life. He was meant to die by my hands.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]The Lien style's reputation was already on its last legs, but they wanted to defame our name nonetheless. It was all a ploy to bring my master to swallow her pride and get her down on her knees.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]—And then—
[stopmusic(fadetime=1)]
[Delay(time=0.8)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]My master, her hair white as ash and braided just like my mother's, stood before all and spilled her own blood as the rules dictated!

[name="Mr. Nothing"]I brought my unconscious master back, but they had our school completely surrounded.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]I could not call for an ambulance, let alone my fellow disciples!
[name="Mr. Nothing"]All I could do was watch her body turn cold. Their men stood outside, unmoving until they saw my poor master buried.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]My master left me with this fan. I don't have the courage to use it, and certainly not the moves she taught me.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]The school was lost, and I had no way to get in touch with my fellow disciples. So I concealed my identity, masquerading as a fortune teller, a Messenger.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]But no matter the case, I did whatever it took to leave that city, and I will make my way to the capital or Lungmen, wherever. The more people there, the better—
[name="Mr. Nothing"]—Then, one day, I shall return to Kou-wu City and make things right.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]That is the story... my benefactor, Kroos, what you said on the day of the rescue. You had the right of it.
[name="Mr. Nothing"]All those years I spent in Kou-wu City... I wasted.
[Character(name="char_362_Saga#2")]
[name="Saga"]I heard stories of the Yan martial artists' sense of honor, yet never would I have imagined such a tale...
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]So it wasn't just a traffic accident...
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#5")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Correct... the villains had men in every corner of Kou-wu City! I watched in hiding from a nearby village, but luck was not on my side. In the end, my only choice was to find myself a car and skip town—
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#5")]
[name="Kroos"]Your master had gone that far, and they still wouldn't leave you alone?
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#5")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Leave me alone?
[name="Mr. Nothing"]If they had their minds set on leaving anyone alone, I doubt they would bend the rules to kill!
