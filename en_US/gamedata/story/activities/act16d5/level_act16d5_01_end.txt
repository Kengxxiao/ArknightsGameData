[name="Kroos"]Haven't noticed any signs of infection, though... and you say creatures, but whenever I shoot them, they just turn into black stains and disappear.

[name="Lava"]Kroos, Mr. Nothing, listen to me.
[name="Lava"]I 'can't remember at all' what happened after I pushed open that wooden cottage door. When I came back to my senses, I was already in that garden listening to the...
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#6")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Umbrella-Boiling Hermit.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Lava"]Right, listening to the Umbrella-Boiling Hermit tell stories. I have absolutely no impression of how I came to be here. Also, I don't know where 'here' is either.

[name="Mr. Nothing"]Benefactor, there's one thing I know for certain. This isn't Ni-weng Village...
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Though I haven't visited Ni-weng in a few years, the way of the land is fashioned quite old. I ran all the way here just now, and I saw not a single electric cable!
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]That makes things even tougher...

[name="Mr. Nothing"]Ho? Benefactors! You shouldn't doubt me now! I'm not the sort of lout that flouts others' graces to him! I'd hardly even be able!
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Lava"]That's not what I meant...
[name="Lava"]I'm just taking in the situation. Everything's been too strange.
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#1",name2="char_455_nothing_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Kroos"]We're not saying we don't trust you, Nothing, mate, it's just we need to be cool and think about all the possibilities here.
[name="Kroos"]Baseline is it's some kind of trap. Whether everything in front of us is real or not.. is a tough question.
[Character(name="avg_npc_144#1",name2="char_455_nothing_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]Now, benefactor, don't treat me like I'm young. I may be carefree as the wind, but I'd still wager I'm older than you...
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#1")]
[name="Lava"]Originium Arts... the possibility's there. But the difficulty's beyond. Is it connected to some specific place? Or did they conjure an outright illusion for us...
[Character(name="char_455_nothing_1#3")]
[name="Mr. Nothing"]You're quite the eccentrics, my benefactors. Any normal person would never be capable of this line of thought under these pressing circumstances.
[Character(name="char_1011_purgatory_1#4")]
[name="Lava"]'Any normal person,' yeah.
[name="Lava"]Even if we don't know where we are, the geography here is way off.
[name="Lava"]The sun and moon are fixed in opposite places, most of the houses are built towards the night side here, while the farms and market are on the other end... but the locals seem totally used to it, and just now, those things...
[name="Lava"]We need information. The faster, the better.
