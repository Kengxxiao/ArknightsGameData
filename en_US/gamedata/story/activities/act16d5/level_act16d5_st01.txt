[name="???"]It's a blessing that you two luminaries rescued me, and only then I could escape intact. As the proverb goes, mere thanks pale before a mighty grace; the least I can offer to you benefactors is a divination... what do you think of that, as a mark of tribute?

[name="Lava"]Th—That was a stupid edit you decided to make to the script afterwards!
[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#2",name2="char_2014_nian_1",focus=2)]
[name="Nian"]Was it? But from when I came to Rhodes Island up till now, haven't you matured a heck of a lot? And you've been learning Arts from some real serious characters.
[name="Nian"]So in short, I leave it up to Kroos and you.
[name="Nian"]I'd better warn you just in case. She's... Dusk's no pushover. She can be a ridiculous pest. Just be prepared to deal with her, and I guarantee you'll go undefeated at mahjong afterwards.

[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#3",name2="char_2014_nian_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]Save it. I'm not gonna dig any deeper, anyway. You aren't like us, I can still tell that much.

[Character(name="char_121_lava_1#1",name2="char_2014_nian_1",focus=1)]
[name="Lava"]Let me just tell you this. I'm willing to help you even though I know how much of a pain this is going to be.
[name="Lava"]So when it comes down to it, you're not going to cut corners on 'repaying' me.

[name="Nian"]You drag Dusk back, and I'll grant any one request of yours. Anything goes. Such as... forging a divine weapon?
[name="Nian"]I've got six weapon concepts right now. I'm one short of seven. Any old one of them would be enough for you to leave your name in history.

[name="Nian"]Or maybe you'd wanna know some ancient stuff from ancient times... I could consider telling you guys. Not too many people should reasonably know about it, I guess, but if you—

[name="Lava"]Pass.

[name="Lava"]...She's called Dusk.
