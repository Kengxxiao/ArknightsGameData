[name="Thorns"]  Sorry to interrupt, but your meat is about to burn.
[name="Thorns"]  Had you turned it over thirty-six seconds ago, you might've still been able to achieve a medium-well state. If you turn off the heat now, you could still have a chance to save the flavor.
[name="Thorns"]  Also, if I'm not mistaken, the charcoal you just added to the stove is damp, and within the next ten seconds, there is a 73% probability that it will explode.
[name="Thorns"]  Hmm, considering the current state of the smoke and the attendant sparks, I'd have to increase that probability by ten percentage points.

[name="Aya"]  Under the surface, there's a waterway that connects to the ocean... It isn't strange that it gives off some ocean vibes. 
[name="Aya"]  Hey. Hey, Mister, wake up. Snap out of it already.
[name="Aya"]  Hmph. I couldn't hypnotize you with my song. That makes me a bit jealous.

[name="Thorns"]  You're the one who should go.

[name="Aya"]  Huh? Ah... that couldn't be, yeah? Look, you know that...
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Thorns"]  That's not something that should be here. If you go now, you won't die.
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Aya"]  I know, but... aren't you the one who's supposed to leave right now?
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Thorns"]  Do you have a death wish?

I fled my homeland. I abandoned my cradle. I've forgotten its stories. But I know how it feels.
I believe what I've heard whispered in legend. Even in shallow dreams, I've felt the bite of swords rending their bodies.
Can I slay the sea itself?
......
I am homesick. Rather, I've imagined it before. But I've never actually seen home.
We Iberians have long left the depths of the Abyss.
But I cannot escape from It. None of us can escape from It.
I want to kill It.

[name="Aya"]  Nope. But you can fight it.
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Thorns"]  You seem quite knowledgeable about these?
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Aya"]  Is this really the time to be having that discussion? I told you, you should leave now.
[name="Aya"]  Hey, are you trembling?

[name="Aya"]  Seems like you don't plan to leave then. So, Mr. Ægir, are you confident you can survive?
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1")]
[name="Thorns"]  Yes.
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=2)]
[name="Aya"]  Will you show me then? I want to see the dance you're about to dance, one that will paint the sea red...
[name="Aya"]  Yes, flourish the sword that weaves with your bounding steps! Spin, pirouette, and glide across the ocean's surface! Whether you are torn apart or you tear It apart, the beginning or end of your story...
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=1)]

[name="Aya"]  I don't know! I think it's perfectly fine!
[name="Aya"]  So, will you show me your performance, Mr. Ægir? Look at that autograph I just gave you. Just let me know, okay?

[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1",name2="npc_2001_Aya_1",focus=1)]
[name="Thorns"]  I don't plan to die. There's a friend who wants your autograph, and I have to stay alive to bring it back.

[name="Aya"]  Back, to Iberia?
[Character(name="char_293_thorns_1")]
[name="Thorns"]  No. Though I've mentioned Iberia, I've also mentioned the sea that my ancestors could not live without.
[name="Thorns"]  But perhaps, my home is no longer in either of those places.
