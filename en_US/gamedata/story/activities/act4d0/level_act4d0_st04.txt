The above is my last will and testament in its entirety.
However, I have one final, selfish request.
In the forests of Siracusa, I met a one-armed Vulpo girl.
She had long walked a single-minded path of revenge.
In my compassion, I gave her aid. While this may have hurt her pride, I found myself moved by her stubborn determination to survive.
I later learned that the aid I gave her only strengthened her obsession with revenge, which left me uneasy.
I want to give her all that I have. Sadly, that is very little. Only a few sad heirlooms.
——Pardon the interruption, but there is no Vulpo on your list of kin. This will make our work rather difficult.
As such, this is but a petty request from a childless Laterano citizen on his deathbed.

You're a real hardass, huh? Doesn't matter. It's just a little thing.
Don't tell her anything about my past, if you can. Make up some story. Tell her I died on the operating table.

Enough. What if I told you doing it this way would save you a lot of trouble in getting your job done?

[name="Vermeil"]  Ammunition...? You mean you would go out into the barrens with me?!
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=2)]
[name="Executor"]  In accordance with your answer, you have been marked by the Notarial Hall as having accepted your inheritance.
[name="Executor"]  However, the contents of the will have not been fully executed. I cannot allow you to expose yourself to such danger. This is my duty.
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=1)]
[name="Vermeil"]  I don't need your help! I'm used to being on my own——
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=2)]
[name="Executor"]  Furthermore, I believe you seek to compromise with me, and then seize the opportunity to escape.
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=1)]
[name="Vermeil"]  Ugh.
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=2)]
[name="Executor"]  There is no time to waste. Let us depart.
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=1)]
[name="Vermeil"]  Hey! I didn't say yes! I don't need some outlander to come and... Hey, wait! Where are you going? Do you even know the way?!
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=2)]
[name="Executor"]  Yes.
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=1)]
[name="Vermeil"]  Watch your feet, there's——
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=2)]
[name="Executor"]  I have disarmed the traps. Come with me.
[Character(name="char_190_clour",name2="char_279_excu_4",focus=1)]
[name="Vermeil"]  Aaah——Sooner or later, I'll show you, you weirdo——!

Please take good care of her, Mr Executor. Really, it could be good for you too.
Don't give me that look. You know what I mean.
Get her out of that mud hole. Don't let her end up like me.
Justice? Maybe what I did was justified, Mister, if the Notarial Hall could find it in their hearts to forgive me.
But it still wouldn't be anything to cheer about. Honestly, it just makes life seem like a big joke.
Her. She's my legacy though.
My hopes and dreams.
May the Lord bless her and keep her.
