[name="Liskarm"]    This is only the fifth round.
[name="Liskarm"]    And you're already slowing down on your targets, and not even hitting vitals.
[name="Liskarm"]    In a real combat situation the enemy could've even shot back.
[name="Liskarm"]    What's wrong, Jessica? Is this training exercise too hard for you?
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]    Ah, er, phew... N- no!
[name="Jessica"]    Let's keep going!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=1)]
[name="Liskarm"]    You have the right attitude, but you need more strength behind it.
[name="Liskarm"]    Let's take ten. Catch your breath.
[name="Liskarm"]    I want to go over handgun basics with you one more time.
[name="Liskarm"]    You can't neglect your fundamentals. Not even for a second.
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=2)]
[name="Jessica"]   Right!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]    First is balance and posture. No matter what kind of environment you're moving through, you can't let yourself go.
[name="Liskarm"]    Keep your upper body low, protect your core.
[name="Liskarm"]    Then, keep the Originium Arts you're using to control the gun nice and stable.
[name="Liskarm"]    Feel the connection between your arm and the gun's interior. Reach out to the ammunition feeding into the chamber, then activate it and let it fly.
[name="Liskarm"]    It's easier said than done. You have to meticulously engage your Originium Arts to trigger it.
[name="Liskarm"]    If you lose control of your Arts, the gun could misfire. You could even damage it.
[name="Liskarm"]    Last, line up your target, aim, fire, and move.
[name="Liskarm"]    These are the absolute basic basics of Blacksteel firearms theory. You should be well acquainted with them, Jessica.
[name="Liskarm"]    Now, do you know the biggest mistake you made with your shooting just now?
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=2)]
[name="Jessica"]   Um... I haven't trained enough, so I wasn't moving my center of gravity fast enough, and then I didn't control my Originium Arts very well...
[name="Jessica"]   And... I hesitated too much before firing, flinching and missing my targets.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=5, ystrength=8, vibrato=30, randomness=30, block=true)]
[name="Jessica"]   Aaaahh! When I say it out loud, I messed up everything I did!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=1)]
[name="Liskarm"]    You're half right.
[name="Liskarm"]    Jessica, you're trying to do everything all at once. You want to be fast, and you want to hit all your targets.
[name="Liskarm"]    You find yourself worrying about every little thing. You end up getting spooked by your own tail.
[name="Liskarm"]    And because you're so panicked, you're losing control of your Originium Arts. Then, when you start aiming at the enemy, you have to be running control tests inside your weapon.
[name="Liskarm"]    That's why you have so much trouble shooting.
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1",name2="char_259_Jessica_1",focus=2)]
[name="Jessica"]   Th- that's what's happening...?!
[Character(name="char_107_liskam_1")]
[name="Liskarm"]    The first thing you have to do is clear your mind of all those things you worry so much about, and just focus on your fingertips.
[name="Liskarm"]    Trust your partner. The gun in your hand won't betray you.
[name="Liskarm"]    The way you treat it, that's how it'll respond to you.
[name="Liskarm"]    The speed and volume of your Arts aren't important. Just focus on maintaining precise control and stability.
[name="Liskarm"]    Come on, let's go. I want to see you move past those three windows and hit as many targets as you can as fast as you can.
[name="Liskarm"]    Go five rounds! Focus on your Originium Arts!
[Character(name="char_259_Jessica_1")]
[name="Jessica"]    Got it!

[name="Franka"]      Fundamentals, fundamentals, fundamentals. It's been three hours...
[name="Franka"]      Get me out of this sweaty training room.
[name="Franka"]      It's just a scouting mission in some ruins, an easy little thing for Jessica to take care of.
[name="Franka"]      You think she'll run into a big baddie out for a stroll?
[name="Franka"]      What I think she needs to train most of all is her confidence.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     Looking at Blacksteel files, Jessica's stats are all completely middle-of-the-pack.
[name="Liskarm"]     And it's not like she's not under pressure, with this special mission attached to Rhodes Island.
[name="Liskarm"]     She's going out with Frostleaf and Meteorite and they'll take care of her. But making sure she's prepared can't hurt.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]      It's gonna hurt when she passes out from exhaustion in the ruins out there.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     ......
[name="Liskarm"]     She came looking for me to train up her combat ability. She's worried she'll be a burden.
[name="Liskarm"]     Right after the Lungmen cleanup, we're heading back to Blacksteel HQ. We don't have much time to train Jessica.
[name="Liskarm"]     I'm trying to share as much of my experience as possible, especially with firearms.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]     You take such good care of your little girl. It's sweet.
[name="Franka"]     Who knew you remembered we had to go back to Blacksteel.
[name="Franka"]     We'll report on the Lungmen situation, but we also have the usual tests to go through.
[name="Franka"]     You're not preparing at all? Not worried about your numbers?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     I've already prepared everything we need to give to the company. It's not like I've been goofing off every night at Rhodes Island
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]     Hehe, how did you know I've just been goofing off?
[name="Franka"]     You really look after your teammates, Liskarm.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     And as for my scores, if they drop too much and I get transferred, at least I won't have to deal with you—
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]    Judging by what you've been doing with Jessica, I guess the idea is just to pile on the training so she gains experience?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     ......
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]    I just see her grinding away over and over and over again.
[name="Franka"]    I mean if you're just having a little firearms seminar, why not go get those sparkly angels?
[name="Franka"]    They're the real gun masters, right? Bang! Pow! I bet they'd straighten Jessica out. A lot better than learning from you, anyway.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]     If you go ask them, all you'll get is, 'What is there to study? There is nothing simpler.' 'Why not just feel it out?' Answers like that.
[name="Liskarm"]     To those angels, who walk around with multiple heavy weapons, a handgun like this is little more than a toy.
[name="Liskarm"]     Laterano firearms practices are insanely advanced and complicated. She couldn't learn anything from them.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]       Heh. Makes you kind of envious, doesn't it?
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]       Getting a handle on the fine control of Originium Arts under a wide variety of potential circumstances is no easy feat, and doesn't come with a typical training regimen.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]     Why do the Blacksteel bosses even want their people using such nasty weapons?
[name="Franka"]     It's a long-range weapon that's harder to use than a crossbow, with more expensive ammunition, and more finicky maintenance.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]    The pistol is a logical enough choice for Blacksteel.
[name="Liskarm"]    Standardized weapons make management easier for the company, reduce turnover, and screen out mediocrity.
[name="Liskarm"]    Plus they have a guaranteed rate of fire and are easier to conceal than other ranged weapons.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]      All right, all right. I get it. 
[name="Franka"]     You just keep at it. I'm gonna head home, if you don't mind.
[name="Franka"]     I'm cheering Jessica on in spirit. I need to rest up some more before we go back to HQ.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]        I didn't call you here for my health. Jessica needs your help too.
[name="Liskarm"]    I can't teach her frontline assault and high speed maneuvers at the same time.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]      Just teach her to carry a big shield and move around while shocking people.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]      Be serious.
[name="Liskarm"]      Your experience is worth a lot more to Jessica than my advice.
[name="Liskarm"]      Moving back and forth around the front lines, breaking through the enemy's defenses, maintaining Originium Arts to power weapons.
[name="Liskarm"]      Nobody in Blacksteel has the kind of control over Originium Arts that you do.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=1)]
[name="Franka"]       Stop stop stop already. How is it this kind of stuff just flows out of you?
[name="Franka"]       You're embarrassing me.
[name="Franka"]      Anyway, it's not that I'm against teaching Jessica. I just have no idea how to be a teacher.
[name="Franka"]      What if she can't follow me? What if she can't keep up? I don't know if I can slow down.
[Character(name="char_106_franka_1", name2="char_107_liskam_1", focus=2)]
[name="Liskarm"]        That's fine. That's how Jessica would want it.

[name="Franka"]       Actually take a look, dumbass.
[name="Franka"]       She doesn't top Blacksteel's charts, but in absolute terms she's not much worse than us.
[name="Franka"]       We know Jessica could stand to be more confident, but these aren't a stupid kid's scores.
[name="Franka"]       She's trained long and hard, and she's committed to not letting us down.
