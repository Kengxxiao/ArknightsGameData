Everything was white.
From the sky above my head to the ground beneath my feet, everything I could see was a calming white.
Pure, silent, empty white.
Only the flames flickered and swayed.
Eventually, my dream quietly eroded, melting away until finally I awakened.
'Where am I?'
No answer.
'Why am I here?'
No answer.
'Should I leave?'
No answer.
“......”
There was no one but me.
There was nothing but me.
And so,
My confusion left only one——
'What... are you?'

Cruel.
Wanton.
Rampage.
Destroyed everything.
......
I know it's all true.
The painful experiments make me sick.
The stares of the people in the white coats make me sick.
This place makes me sick.
This is no life.
This is no future.
All it would take is one flame, one lick hot enough, and all their disgusting eyes, all those white walls stinking of disinfectant, all of it would go up in smoke.
As long as the people I like survive.
The rest mean nothing.
——That's how I used to think. Before I came here.
I think that's how I always thought.
But I'm different now.
Cruel.
I know I know.
Wanton.
Okay, fine, I'll be careful.
Rampage.
...it really wasn't that bad!
Destroyed everything.
I didn't mean to!
It's not like I don't know. 
But at least, hrm...
Like you said. I can do it.
I won't burn Rhodes Island, or my homework.
Or my friends. Hrmm... my friends are all as great as me anyway!
So, it's fine. I get it. I haven't been trying hard enough. I have to try even harder.
Just watch me. I'll show all of you!
