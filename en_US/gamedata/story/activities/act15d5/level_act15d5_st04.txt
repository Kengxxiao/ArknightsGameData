Our sister, Hildegard. Today, we see you off.
May the light extol your path forth, may piety and conviction be forever by your side.
The bells of Landen Monastery cross long through... hm? What?
*cough* The bells of Landen Monastery cross long through the years, tolling centuries of... Wine!?
Wh—Why has wine been left here? Where did... my Lord, don't tell me the old man snuck it in? Shh! Sshhh!
To be brief, may Landen's centuries of glory be with you! Now, Hildegard! Come here and help! Help us get the wine barrel open!
Hee-hee, we can't have a farewell without this, can we? Now, before the old man comes back! Cheers!

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#4", focus=2)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Good morning, or should I say good afternoon, Mr. Bison. It's been long since I laid on a bed. I seem to be somewhat remiss.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#4", focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]  It's been a long journey, I don't blame you. I came to confirm your travel itinerary today; hopefully I didn't disturb your rest?

[name="Bison"]  You came from Laterano... such a far-off country, all the way to Lungmen. It can't have been easy, can it?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#5", focus=2)]
[name="Hildegard"]  It wasn't.
[name="Hildegard"]  This is my own first time so far from Laterano... Long-distance travel isn't as simple as admiring the scenery, it turns out.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#5", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#5", focus=2)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Mm-hm. It's a stone's throw from the city center, and very cheaply priced. You've got some keen insight.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#5", focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]  You don't need to worry about expenses, actually. MountainDash Logistics will reimburse the costs of your time in Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1", name2="char_332_archet#5", focus=2)]
[name="Hildegard"]  No, as a representative of Landen Monastery, I can't depend on the wealth of others. Forgive me for that.
[name="Hildegard"]  What's more, I'm on this mission precisely to address the many problems besetting the Monastery. I could never partake excessively of others' friendship on their land, all while indulging myself.

[name="Bison"]  Well, I won't bother you any further...
[name="Bison"]  But if you have any spare time, I'd like to hear your stories about Laterano. Just as you're curious about Lungmen, I... think about that place a lot.

[name="Hildegard"]  ...Bread.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="char_383_snsant_1", focus=2)]
[name="Snowsant"]  Bread?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="char_383_snsant_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  It's ancient, a convent situated amongst the wheat fields and hills. 
[name="Hildegard"]  It was originally for the training of Apostolic warriors. Its greatest difference from the Notarial Hall and the Apostolic Knights is that Landen Monastery accepts people from countries the world over.
[name="Hildegard"]  But...
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="char_383_snsant_1", focus=2)]
[name="Snowsant"]  Gulp. But..?
[Character(name="char_332_archet", name2="char_383_snsant_1", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  But these last few years have been too peaceful! The Notarial Hall mopped up every last bit of our work! We didn't get a single new disciple this year! The old man's cohort refuses any grants on the grounds of teaching the Monastery to be self-reliant!
[name="Hildegard"]  It's about to go bankrupt. The time-honored Landen Monastery is about to go BANKRUPT because of its financial issues!!
[Character(name="char_332_archet", name2="char_383_snsant_1", focus=2)]

[name="Hildegard"]  Why choose Landen Monastery?
[name="Hildegard"]  If a company with the heft of MountainDash Logistics seeks to open Messenger channels and refine its procedures...
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Nonsense. We're deeply honored to be able to cooperate with an establishment as long and storied as Landen Monastery.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  ......
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  —Do you know what the limit of my logistics company's reach is?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  What is it?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  As proud as I am of MountainDash Logistics, it's got no footprint beyond Lungmen and the five cities of Yan around it.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  What about Ursus, or Victoria? Lungmen is a crucial outwards-facing hub for Yan, so shouldn't foreign...
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Unlike what the average person on the street thinks, it's damned hard for a logistics company to operate anywhere outside of its country of registration.
[name="Eurill"]  Even with fully lawful transit, most civil logistics business still gets passed onto locally partnered Messenger orgs afterwards. Not a single country's so loose it'd let other nations' Messengers run free range on its own soil.
[name="Eurill"]  Of course... that's just 'over-the-table' modes of work, but we don't need to probe into any sort of gray area right about now. Don't you mind it.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  I see, then...
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  It's exactly as you say. For the stable setup of all kinds of information and transport hub links, the costs are—yes—not at all proportional to the profits the Monastery's goods bring in.
[name="Eurill"]  Even the cost of setting up a single Catastrophe Messenger base station'd blow your socks off.
[name="Eurill"]  However, this piece of business is a pathway connecting us to Laterano. I assume you understand what significance that holds.
[name="Eurill"]  This is only one blueprint amongst the things I wish to do, and at the very end of this pathway, Messengers will be able to overturn the barriers of culture and race. We can, with our own two hands, reach across this whole world.
[name="Eurill"]  I know, for all sorts of reasons, that in all probability this wouldn't come about. Race, culture, history, and from time to time Catastrophes adding to the mix.
[name="Eurill"]  Innumerous factors roiling around our strip of world have ensured the countries can't pull together as one.
[name="Eurill"]  Perhaps we must weather war, withstand Catastrophe. Perhaps this plan fundamentally cannot have a smooth ride within this split-up, estranged world of ours—
[name="Eurill"]  But that does not stand to forbid... the existence of bridges.
[name="Eurill"]  That being the case, we should try to part the great waves first.
[name="Eurill"]  By certain means, I've come to notice... the Apostle, the one and only, seems pretty open to this kind of thought exercise. Because of that, perhaps Laterano is our first step of a sorts in testing this new direction.

[name="Eurill"]  Cleric Hildegard?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  No, sorry, I just never thought I'd be able to hear such things...
[name="Hildegard"]  Does your son know about this, erm, magnificent plan of yours?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Of course he doesn't. He still needs to polish himself. As I've said before, this project cannot be built in a day. I'm not the kind of person who rigs up bridges by his own hands. Maybe he is. Maybe, or maybe he isn't.
[name="Eurill"]  But he's my son, and that's enough.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Landen Monastery will assuredly find it a valuable experience, working in conjunction with your firm.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  The honor is all mine, Cleric Hildegard.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  To tell the truth, Mr. Eurill, my own way of thinking is very simplistic. I adore my convent, and I believe the exemplary culture of Landen Monastery deserves to continue on.
[name="Hildegard"]  And so, I pray this will not spell its end.
[name="Hildegard"]  In comparison to your hopes, our motives may seem somewhat self-centered now.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Absolutely not, Cleric Hildegard. It's no small thing, wholeheartedly taking in and cherishing the homeland you adore.
[name="Eurill"]  —And you don't need to worry if this'll bring the Monastery much trouble. Landen Monastery stands only as Landen Monastery, nothing more.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Heheh, I didn't mean it like that. You have a lot on your mind, Mr. Eurill.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Nonsense. I should say that to you, Cleric Hildegard. Back when I was your age, I sure couldn't keep my head cool like yours.
[name="Eurill"]  It's gotten pretty late. We'll be getting a dinner party together for you tomorrow, Cleric Hildegard. Before that, you get some good shuteye.

[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  The value of things shouldn't be decided prior to their coming. At the very least, we can choose to have some respect for all things and all creatures.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Is that a principle of the Monastery, too?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Just Laterano nature. For that matter, Mr. Eurill, did you just want to test the present attitude of Landen Monastery?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Nonsense. I'm just curious what kind of heart my current collaborators bring to their work.
[name="Eurill"]  Obviously, I wouldn't doubt my own business. Thing is, once some things get beyond the scope of business, I have to start minding what other people think.
[name="Eurill"]  How do you see it?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Landen Monastery tells a fable.
[name="Hildegard"]  They say, in a certain church in Laterano, there was a vast mural, depicting a story of heroes in ancient times, fighting for their faith.
[name="Hildegard"]  Artists, from all over, all came to examine this mural. Some praised, some criticized, some chose to keep a rational quiet.
[name="Hildegard"]  —Then, from a small little quarter of Leithanien, came an upstart.
[name="Hildegard"]  The upstart was bloated, and unwilling to climb the church's stairs, thereupon he gazed at the church's window from afar. Through that window, he sighted a single deformed, vile beast in the artwork.
[name="Hildegard"]  And immediately, this businessman began to slander the mural, first saying that the hallowed and pure Laterano had produced such repulsive paintings, downright immoral.
[name="Hildegard"]  Soon after, he spoke that even this single vile beast had a great many imperfections in the art.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Vile beast?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Little did he realize that what he saw was not a vile beast in the mural, but a church ornament and a candleholder's silhouette, which by misfortune had given him such a mistaken impression.
[name="Hildegard"]  He couldn't even step into the grand church, yet dismantling what he saw in that superficial fragment, he came to an insight more superficial still.
[name="Hildegard"]  Where do you think the problem arose from?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  —Arrogance, and prejudice.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  So this fable is named 'La Bestia Superba.' If you should ask 'why did the church construct so high of a staircase?', that was indeed an arrogance in itself.
[name="Hildegard"]  What you want to do—that is to shatter all arrogance, or at the least, between every country, every land, every race's inharmonious arrogances, find a path, through the life mission of a Messenger.
[name="Hildegard"]  And between those, you even include the very arrogance of nature and life itself—Catastrophes.
[name="Hildegard"]  In realistic terms, I feel it will be very hard.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Someone's always got to be that stepping stone.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  This has eased my heart some.  When we're meant to talk money, we should talk it. But here, with you, Mr. Eurill, we're certainly talking of more than just money...
[name="Hildegard"]  We're talking of quite a fair project. I feel a deep admiration for your ability to run things.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Hah hah hah, if that's how you think, then I'm completely and utterly relieved.
[name="Eurill"]  If you have the chance, why not take that son of mine on a trip to Laterano.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  But of course.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#5", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  After all, ever since he came into contact with Mostima, I can see in his eyes, his idea of a 'Messenger' has grown a lot less narrow. Not bad—hm? What's that look for?
[Character(name="char_332_archet", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  I feel like I've heard a name I can't quite let pass.
[Character(name="char_332_archet", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Oh? Was she that famous? I thought her reputation was pretty internal to the Messenger biz.
[Character(name="char_332_archet", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Well, ever since she was exiled, I haven't heard more about her, really.
[name="Hildegard"]  Sankta can live very good lives wherever they are. After all, they're Sankta.
[Character(name="char_332_archet", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  Hah hah, true words.
[name="Eurill"]  Right, Emperor wanted me to give you this.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  Um? Emperor?
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]  A very tenacious guy. He does everything off-script, but make no mistake, he's reliable.
[Character(name="char_332_archet#3", name2="avg_npc_030", focus=1)]
[name="Hildegard"]  This is... a contact address? Is this a... company?
[name="Hildegard"]  Rho... Rhodes Island... Is that how you read it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_030")]
[name="Eurill"]  Ah... once in a while, you trust Emperor's taste in associates. And you can trust me, they and this strip of world are marvelous one and the same.
