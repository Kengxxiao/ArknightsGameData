[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1")]
[name="Amiya"]  But there is one thing that I'm sure of.
[name="Amiya"]  You'll find people antagonizing and looking down on others wherever you are and no matter the circumstances.
[name="Amiya"]  It can happen between the Infected and the healthy. It can also happen between the rich and the poor. Sometimes it even happens just because someone drew an arbitrary boundary...
[name="Amiya"]  There will always be people trying to drive a wedge between themselves and others, to set themselves apart, to raise themselves up.
[name="Amiya"]  Please don't try to deny it just yet, Ms. Ch'en. I heard that there are a lot of Infected in Columbia. They're allowed to make a living as explorers, and some of them even got citizenship... I think there's hope in a life like that.
[name="Amiya"]  It's just, Ms. Chen, whether a place is good or bad is something we have to see and determine for ourselves. Ursus is a downright cruel place, but there are a lot of places that have only whitewashed their cruelty.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#7")]
[name="Amiya"]  I haven't forgotten what you said that day at the control tower, Ms. Ch'en.
[name="Amiya"]  To treat everyone as equals and to judge everyone fairly... That's a beautiful thing, but I'm afraid it won't be easy.
[name="Amiya"]  No one has ever walked that path, so not only is there no one to point us in the right direction, we only have ourselves to count on as we slowly forge that path for ourselves.
[Character(name="char_002_amiya_1#4")]

[name="Ch'en"]  There's a deadline on the contract; just trying to get it over with as soon as possible.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  That's amazing!
[name="Clerk"]  Here's your mission lists, one for each person.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Thanks.
[name="Ch'en"]  And right, we've got a new hire on our team. Here's his application form. Think you can issue the credentials for him?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Hm? New blood on the team?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  It was a sudden decision, so I wasn't able to let you know ahead of time. Sorry, this is my fault.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Oh, it's no problem. Give me a minute. I need to get a new form.
[name="Clerk"]  Oh, could you pass on some good news to Amiya for me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  What is it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  The prophylactics you guys promoted last time got some really good feedback. If you can manage to keep the price low enough, I think it'll find a decent footing in the market.
[name="Clerk"]  If you guys can do that, I'm sure we'll send sales through the roof!
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  That does sound like good news. I'm sure Amiya will be happy to hear that.
[name="Ch'en"]  If the sales volume gets any bigger, though, we'll need to deliver the medicine here straight from Rhodes Island... Hm, I'll let Amiya know right away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Haha, that sounds wonderful. I haven't seen Amiya in so long!
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Are you two... acquainted?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  We know each other pretty well! I study medicine, and I used to intern on the ship. I really missed home, though, so I talked to Dr. Kal'tsit about it, and I came back here.
[name="Clerk"]  It's not bad. Once I make a little more money, I'll have saved up enough to start a clinic with my friends.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Good luck to you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Thanks. Don't forget, if any operators get hurt during their missions, just come to me for help. I'll patch them right up!
[name="Clerk"]  Alright, I guess I'll head home.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Sure, I'll walk you back.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Oh, don't worry yourself about me. I'll be alright. You be careful on the road, Ms. Ch'en!
[name="Clerk"]  There was that murder that happened the other day. That was super creepy, wasn't it...? By the way, I'm not sure if you've heard, but there's actually a pretty interesting followup to the whole thing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Oh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Everyone's talking about it. I heard they'd caught someone from the Infected zone at first, but somehow the actual killer turned himself in to the cops not even two days after that, so they ended up letting the first guy go.
[name="Clerk"]  I don't buy it, though. That's definitely not the entire story.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Why is that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Well... this stays right here, Ms. Ch'en. Don't let anyone else know!
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Alright, I'll keep it a secret.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  I have a relative who works at the police station, so this is insider information. I heard the actual killer didn't turn himself in. A mysterious person had caught him and left him in front of the station with evidence!
[name="Clerk"]  Can you imagine that? Something like that happening in this day and age?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  Haha, that does sound really bizarre.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1#7", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Right?! I even heard the tabloids are going to give this man of mystery a name!
[name="Clerk"]  The Bad Samaritan! The Punisher Outside the System! The Hero of Poetic Justice! There's so many of them, and they all sound so cool!
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  ......
[name="Ch'en"]  Cool? I'm not sure I agree.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  Oh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=2)]
[name="Ch'en"]  If the local police didn't catch the wrong guy, they wouldn't have needed someone else to come out and do their job.
[name="Ch'en"]  I'd rather society have no place for these vigilantes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032", name2="char_010_chen_1", focus=1)]
[name="Clerk"]  I guess you're right...

[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5")]
[name="Ch'en"]  Roger that.
[name="Ch'en"]  Is that all you're bringing with you? You may not be able to bring everything, but you can still take a few souvenirs. 
[Character(name="char_010_chen_1#5",name2="avg_npc_012",fadetime=2)]
[name="Masked Rhodes Island Operator"]  I'm good.
