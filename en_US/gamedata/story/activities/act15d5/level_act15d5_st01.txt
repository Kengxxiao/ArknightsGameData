[name="Shirayuki"]  The Madam is away. My orders, to protect thee.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Got it.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Lady Shirayuki, I heard the Madam recently assigned you to Rhodes Island?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  How is it? Is little Amiya still holding up? And the Doctor by her side... I remember that one sticking behind cover giving orders. Freakishly smart, freakishly tired. How are they all now?
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  In plentiful vigor, spirits held high.
[name="Shirayuki"]  Raucous blather.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#3",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  Loud sort.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#3",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ha ha ha ha, sounds like they're still full of beans.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  It seems like you have a pretty nice impression of Rhodes Island, Lady Shirayuki.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  Truly, Rhodes Island is agreeable.
[name="Shirayuki"]  As goes for Miss Ch'en.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#5",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  ...Thou needn't dwell.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#5",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  What, so now even Lady Shirayuki's saying it... You're not telling me I've got worry written across my entire face? Seriously?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  That can't be right. If I was like that, Missy would've torn a layer off my face this morning.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  ......
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  It's okay, Lady Shirayuki. I'm not worried about Ch'en, that's the truth.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Truest truth. Don't judge Ch'en by her cover. Sure, she'll snap like whiplash, but she's got a delicate heart in there.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I didn't see it coming when I first met her all the way back. Only came to realize after being with her a lot more. I believe as long as she has a brick wall to bash her head against, she'll live decent no matter where it is.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  Intelligent and sharp-witted is Miss Ch'en.
[name="Shirayuki"]  Tongue incisive, and her action ne'er pales.
[name="Shirayuki"]  The commonfolk cannot hope to cheat her.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Ha ha, true that.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Tell me, where do you find someone like her? Piss her off and she'll switch to chewing people out, and as long as there's reason, she'll chew out anyone. I've never seen her scared before.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  Miss Ch'en... is unreserved.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Honestly, Ch'en's temper hasn't changed once in all these years.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I've always felt she put a lot of stress on chivalry. In those manga about master swordsmen, her sort would be the main character.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But, you know, blood and gore's fun enough to read about, but having those wounds on your own body really aches something fierce.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  There are times I see her aching beyond help, and I think, is it really worth this?
[name="Hoshiguma"]  It isn't worth it. In truth, in full honesty, I feel it truly isn't worth it.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#4",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But she thinks it is.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I'm not worried if she comes to grief. A little grief is no bad thing. Get too strong-willed and you'll come to a lot worse.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I'm just scared that she can't get over it. That she can't let it go.

[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#5",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  Miss Ch'en's soul is wide.
[name="Shirayuki"]  Rid of her chest's weight, she is ever more unstoppable.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#5",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  You see clearly, Lady Shirayuki. And Master Wei and the Madam see even more plainly.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  You too, Madame Hoshiguma, are chivalrous.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Me? Stop it, that's over the top now. I'm clear when it comes to myself.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  When I was young, I didn't know how things worked. I dreamed, of course, too.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  I've done a lot of impulsive things, and it's not like I've never had some hot blood in me.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  But the hot-blooded story's over, the kid's no longer a kid, and now what? They wouldn't write this stuff in a story. Write it and the readers'd get mad. Total waste of effort. Save yourself the trouble of ever writing it.
[name="Hoshiguma"]  Stories get to end at the best possible times. Life doesn't.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Hoshiguma"]  If chivalry looked like me, carrying the weight of the world, then people wouldn't be into it.
[Character(name2="char_118_yuki#5",name="char_136_hsguma_ns_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Shirayuki"]  One cannot undervalue oneself.
