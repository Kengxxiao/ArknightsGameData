[name="Kal'tsit"]Breogan... was the owner of that key.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]During Iberia's Golden Age, he became a guest of honor to the aristocrats and nobility. He was once seen as the symbol of the budding harmony between the Ægir Islanders and Iberians.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Nobody knows what he was doing right before the disaster, or what he lacked the time to do. But he had already left behind a significant legacy. And for you, significant directions.

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Yes... I hope we'll succeed. Humanity faces too many problems, and the layers upon layers of disasters can easily extinguish the light of our current civilization.

Gladiia solemnly steps onto the ship's bow.
The sea breeze cleaves a path through the night, carrying upon it a familiar scent.
The quiet vessel sleeps soundly atop the ocean. It is a vassal of the sea breeze, the guest of an era.
Idealism was ubiquitous in that era, and it reflected the peoples' spirit of exploration—as well as their arrogance.
Skadi and Gladiia gaze wordlessly at the ship.
In an instant, they are inundated with a flood of thoughts. But in the end, they are invariably dragged back to the past—their youth, their home, the rhythmic swaying of the ship.
Only Specter continues to grip tightly onto the weapon in her hand, the sea breeze picking up slightly.
This breeze will carry the Hunters home.
