The sea is black.
I was four or five at the time. Old Thiago, the mayor of Gran Faro, took an armed company of adults down to the coast.
I still remember what the weather was like back then. It was hazy and turbulent, and colder than most evenings despite still being afternoon. Its coldness was not a temperature, but rather a color. One that had lost its warmth.
I found out only later that that was the last time Gran Faro did maintenance work on the Eye of Iberia. Or rather, tried to.
The Penal Battalion quickly brought back news. There was dejection in the adults' faces, but I didn't fully understand what had happened. I simply stared at the junction between sea and sky in a daze.
The sea is black.
It perfectly suits this land devoid of hope.
