Monique has seen the skills of the Sarkaz before her.
Excellent swordsmanship. Complex, seemingly incomprehensible Originium Arts - perhaps witchcraft. Along with the Radiant Knight, she was able to block a Darksteel arrow.
She had a suspicion at the time, that perhaps... 'blocking arrows' was not the full extent of the Sarkaz's abilities.
But now, she is convinced of one thing.
[name="Monique"]  ...I can't tell you that.

The opponent was not some famous hero, but a true veteran of the Ursus-Kazimierz War.
His quick reflexes spared him the arrow from the darkness, and the two ended up locked in combat until they plunged off a cliff.
The forests of Kazimierz were cold and steep in the early spring, and the chase through the dense woods lasted seven days and nights.
At the moment when the pain in her limbs and the ringing in her ears were almost intolerable, she drew her bowstring back and nocked her arrow once more, finding her target as he stopped for water.

[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  So that's the hero, the Blood Knight. So much fanfare for that name.
[name="Spokesman Malkiewicz"]  Though the Radiant Knight is a paragon of defiance, the one who truly managed to carve out a space for the Infected... is the Blood Knight, Dikaiopolis.

The Sarkaz slowly closes her eyes, as if refusing to view her Arts.
A brief brilliance lingers on the tip of her sword, like the setting sun.
As if she suddenly remembered something, the Sarkaz quickly changes her pose, bringing the sword into her embrace.
As if this sword never should be unsheathed.

[name="Monique"]  What... did you do just now...
[name="Monique"]  Was that Sarkaz witchcraft? No, what I felt just now was...
The breath of life? No. A soul's lifeforce? No.
It was more like a formless illusion, something that could only be touched while in a trance or a drunken stupor.

But there is no doubt that just now, the Sarkaz... was wielding the twilight.

[name="Shining"]  I'll consider it, out of respect for you keeping your word.
[Character(name="avg_npc_208_1#2")]
[name="Monique"]  For you Sarkaz, is there some kind of significance... to cutting off your horns?
[character(name="char_147_shining_1")]
[name="Shining"]  It differs from person to person. Some may see their Sarkaz heritage as a curse, and may do that as a way of trying to hide their identity.
[name="Shining"]  It might also be a way to channel a certain form of witchcraft, to a facilitate a certain Arts.
[name="Shining"]  Or perhaps... it might even be a tradition of some unconventional tribes. The possibilities are many, and there's no way to say for sure.
