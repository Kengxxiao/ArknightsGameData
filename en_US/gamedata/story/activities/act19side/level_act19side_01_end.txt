A hand smashes through the power armor's core. Countless mechanical fragments burst out like fireworks, just as the blood of a fellow lifeform would.
With no time to waste, that hand pulls out.
The mecha-fragment extracted by her sheer force turns into dust, together with the pure white plating covering her five digits. It all drifts down to the floor, where it forms a paper-thin calcium crystal layer.
The power armor lies on the ground, the heat of its energy snuffed, a clean hole left through its torso.
