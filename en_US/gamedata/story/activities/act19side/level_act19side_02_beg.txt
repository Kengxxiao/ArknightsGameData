Its surface is exceptionally glossy, issuing gentle silver rays all about, and it hovers faintly up and down at this moment, as if following some sort of breathing pattern.
After rising up behind the Pioneer, about three seconds pass where it hangs in the air.
Then immediately, it slowly rotates its own body, as if curiously assessing every human at the scene.
