The massive machine sits silent in the darkness.
The intertwining tubes are like sprawling rhizomes, shoots growing out at the ends.
Each shoot is an electrode glowing faintly, absorbing nutrition from the lifeform underneath.
The missing Pioneers lie side by side, electrodes on their heads.
They breathe and their hearts beat, but they are oblivious to what is happening around them.
A silvery liquid flows through the tubes, converging on the device at the center of the room.
It seems more alive than the dozens of catatonic test subjects.
