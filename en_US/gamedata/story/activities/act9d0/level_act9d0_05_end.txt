Talulah changed.
The first time I met her, the feeling she gave me was just like that of Her Majesty, Theresa.
But, Her Majesty has always been tragic, burdened... and she knew more about the secrets of this land.
Talulah is different. She is wrathful, but just calm enough. Still, a zealous anger burns within her.
Though they were different in many small ways, they had the same kind of strength. Or, maybe people like them are similar in many ways regardless of their strength.
This anger gave rise to Reunion, which attracted countless followers.
But soon... she changed.
Our daily work has turned into incitement. Provocation. Destruction.
This is no longer a revolution for the masses of Infected—
—but rather the same kind of over-engineered, conspiratorial war that we have seen in Kazdel, time and time again.

[name="Hoederer"]  She hasn't caught up yet.
[name="Hoederer"]  ...If we really run into her head-on, there's going to be trouble.
[name="Hoederer"]  You shouldn't use your Arts on Talulah. This isn't the first time either. We must always be careful of what we see.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  ...Something must have happened to Talulah. We have to tell W.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  We've got a lot of heavies suspicious of us thanks to W's little plans. Do you want to make things even worse?
[name="Hoederer"]  What exactly did you see?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  The old Talulah was just a rebel. She freed the Infected and gave them an opportunity to fight back.
[name="Ines"]  But now? There's no effort made to curb their base desires. There is only mindless destruction and killing.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  That doesn't prove anything. That's how the other races have always treated the Infected. They're not like Sarkaz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  ...You don't understand.
[name="Ines"]  The behavior by itself isn't a big deal, but I'm talking about the consequences...
[name="Ines"]  Talulah... She's sabotaging Reunion, on purpose.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Don't you think this situation feels familiar?
[name="Ines"]  She is an excellent leader who can rally ordinary Infected into battle, and win.
[name="Ines"]  But she's the only one who could dismantle the very tower she built, piece by piece, totally undetected.
[name="Ines"]  I could even say...
[name="Ines"]  Talulah herself is just a slightly fancier brick, something that can be crushed at any time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Are you saying that...
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  It's just like three years ago.
[name="Ines"]  But he... he might've always been like that. He did it all without hesitation... He was just good at hiding it.
[name="Ines"]  Talulah isn't like that. Her change was too sudden.
[name="Ines"]  Her shadow... It's as if there are two shadows, but I see no traces of Arts. It's more like...
[name="Ines"]  A set of ruins. Ancient and imposing, still full of lingering power.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  The nature of your Arts is very special. But your feelings are too vague this time, and I can't base my decisions on vague feelings.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  But W needs to know!
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Quiet, we've already been noticed.
[name="Hoederer"]  Anything we do can be used against someone else. You understand this, yes?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Do you think we can survive a second Babel incident?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  I'm not sure...
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  ...I know W can't.
[name="Ines"]  I'll go find her. Garcin is dead, so she should be the new leader.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Wait! If Talulah really has her eyes on us already, if you do this—
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  I can't wait any longer. Don't give me orders, we're still the same rank.
[name="Ines"]  ...Hmph.
[name="Ines"]  I say that, but this is the first time I've disobeyed your orders.
[name="Ines"]  You shouldn't always overthink things, Hoederer.

[name="Reunion Soldier"]  First, a few mercenary teams defected. Then, enemies started showing up in the city.

[Character(name="avg_npc_052")]
[name="Ines"]  Out of my way. I don't have to listen to your whining.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
[name="Reunion Soldier"]  You have to answer to Talulah.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052")]
[name="Ines"]  ...I know. After I report to W, I will then report to Talulah.
[Character(name="char_1002_nsabr_2")]
