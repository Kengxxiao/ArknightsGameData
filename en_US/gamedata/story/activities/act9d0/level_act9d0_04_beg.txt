I know what I said. No one could just watch from the sidelines. There could be no bystanders.
And yet, I still wanted to escape from the war. From Babel, from W, and from Her Majesty...
So I ran.
...What a hypocrite.
Do I regret it? Maybe.
But even if I stayed there, I wouldn't have been able to accomplish anything.

[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Why are you throwing a question back at me?
[name="Ines"]  ...This deadlock has been dragging on for ages. Do you think the scales will tip overnight?
[name="Ines"]  What the hell happened these last six months? Aren't things moving way too quickly...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  We all know something went wrong.
[name="Hoederer"]  But as to exactly where, nobody knows.
[name="Hoederer"]  I guess I shouldn't say nobody.
[name="Hoederer"]  Her Majesty... and the people around her. That never should've happened to them. That's what we all think.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  But right now... what about us? Will the same thing happen to us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Too soon. This war ended too quickly.
[name="Hoederer"]  Up until last month, we were still working our contract with Babel. Then, they went quiet. We stopped getting any news...
[name="Hoederer"]  Everyone knew which side we were on, and it's not like we were even ready to leave.
[name="Hoederer"]  ...If that's really the end of things, we have nowhere to run.
[name="Hoederer"]  Tell the Messenger to start pulling contacts and see what intel we can dig up.
[name="Hoederer"]  Maybe we'll... have to return to the real battlefield.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  I also figured that day was coming.
[name="Ines"]  We all knew it deep down, didn't we?
[name="Ines"]  If we really wanted to wash our hands of the whole thing, we wouldn't have agreed to work with them in the first place.
[name="Ines"]  We could've left on our own, crossed Lake Valendan, and made a killing somewhere else—
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Ines, I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Stop.
[name="Ines"]  It'd be even harder for us to pull out of there. Too easy to get lost in that warmth. We'd get drunk on it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  Maybe we should just abandon Babel and take our people away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  I can't tell you how long, but it feels like it's been ages since I've made a good decision that actually helped us.
[name="Hoederer"]  Maybe we really don't belong on the battlefield anymore...
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Enough of that. Which one of us is the Sarkaz here?
[name="Ines"]  Is there a single other place on Terra, like even a wooden shed over our heads, that can handle a bunch of bloodstained Sarkaz?
[name="Ines"]  Don't always blame yourself. We all share the burden.
[name="Ines"]  Also, looking back, I can say that you made the right decision to take in W.
[name="Ines"]  She's made a lot of money for us. And offed a lot of people.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  ...Hope so.
[name="Hoederer"]  W... Is she still alive?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  I don't think she'd die so easily.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=2)]
[name="Hoederer"]  She spent a decent amount of time with Her Majesty as well. Who knows, maybe she learned a thing or two.
[name="Hoederer"]  We need to get a grasp quick of the situation in Kazdel right now. If we can find her again, things might get a little easier.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Do we really need her to back us up?

[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Do you need another reminder?
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Theresa is dead. All of Kazdel, all of Terra will know that Kazdel has a new king.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  But that was just a decapitation strike. A lot of your core operators are still alive.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Like that commander of yours who never showed up again. They made the right call.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  His Majesty didn't completely annihilate you because he wants to put a stop to the chaos. Kazdel needs him to pave a new path forward—
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  —But what about you? Who are you to lecture anyone about right or wrong?
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Of course you won't say it, but I know that's what you're thinking. And while you're thinking, you're trying to erase all those faces from your memory, one by one.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  After all, you're just here to vent. Just a petty little mercenary, drowning in her worthless revenge.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  You can't beat anyone.

[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  A bit of both. I won't deny it.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Ever since that— since I almost choked on the blood of my friends, I haven't been able to hold a weapon.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  We've all bled. Splattered it across Babel's palace. What you've seen, I've seen so much more.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  But since you found me, I guess my fate is sealed. Hah.

[name="Ines"]  Sarkaz mercenaries like us never really had a dog in the fight. Most people don't like thinking. They just need someone to give them orders.

[name="Hoederer"]  W, since Her Majesty Theresa disappeared, Kazdel has changed a lot, completely turned on its head.

[Character(name="avg_npc_046#2",name2="avg_npc_047",focus=1)]
