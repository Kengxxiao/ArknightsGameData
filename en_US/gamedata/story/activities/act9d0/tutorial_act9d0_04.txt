[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ines")] Wait up, the enemy's here.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_hoederer")] Their base camp is pretty crude and their numbers are sparse and spread out. They must not have noticed us yet.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ines")] As long as they remain stationed here, they should be on <@tu.kw>Standby</>. We should take the initiative.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_hoederer")] But as soon as they realize they're under attack, they'll immediately become <@tu.kw>Combat-Ready</>. We won't have much leeway here.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ines")] It's quite simple. We can devour them all, <@tu.kw>one by one</>. They won't even have a chance to fight back.
