[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  You... I've seen you somewhere before... comrade. We've met on the battlefield before.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  ...Hey, hey. You shouldn't have come to Chernobog. Everybody here has the intel on Rhodes Island. You're all going to die here.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  But no matter how good you are, you shouldn't have been able to get through W's defensive line. Not unless...
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  By the looks of things, she ended up making that choice after all. In fact, we all expected it.

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  ...Theresa was an exceptional leader. She changed the way many people see this patch of dirt.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  But it was an idealized viewpoint.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  You don't need to argue with me. I know better than you the cruelty that Kazdel has faced, nor do I want to deny her. But for such a tremendous effort, I just want to see some semblance of results.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  Only by the Regent's hand can a new future come to Kazdel. There's not enough goodwill to go around for everyone.

[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  A naive notion. How are we supposed to set aside our years of discontent as Sarkaz? How are we to right a long history of wrongs?
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  Ursus and the uninfected. Reunion and the Infected. Kazdel and the Sarkaz.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  It's all the same. I became more convinced of it during the time I spent working with Reunion.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  His Royal Highness, the Regent, can open a new home for us, and I've chosen to chase this opportunity.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  Just as in the past, you still naively cling to Theresa.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  ...That's enough.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  Since W decided to let you through, you must've also paid the price.
[name="Sarkaz Mercenary Leader"]  What did you give up? An underling who died to buy you time? Or... maybe your own soul?

[name="Ines"]  Stop resisting.
[name="Ines"]  ...The twelve other members of your team have been eliminated.
[name="Ines"]  Leafa, Mimi, and Thumbtack died after being surrounded by Reunion casters. One died on her feet.
[name="Ines"]  Mary, Macron, Slink, and Scorpion held a section that W broke with her own team.
[name="Ines"]  Milim, Tipsy, and Mudflower took one of our teams down with them. One of them fought her way out of the trap, but Hoederer's swordsmen got her head.
[name="Ines"]  Unexpectedly, Pter died downstairs over there not too long ago. Apparently tried to save some civilian who didn't have time to evacuate.
[name="Ines"]  Slanna's still breathing and we took her in, but she's probably looking for some way to kill herself.
[name="Ines"]  ....What, nothing to say?
[name="Ines"]  Stop hiding. I know you can hear me. I can see your shadow, and I can tell from your ragged breathing that you're badly wounded.

[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  W told me specifically for the occasion. You guys keep some kind of dogtags on you.
[name="Ines"]  'At least you have to know who you killed. This isn't Kazdel anymore. It'd be bad if you killed the wrong person.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=2)]
[name="Scout"]  Those aren't dogtags, and the operators we lost... weren't all soldiers.
[name="Scout"]  I thought W would finish me herself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Hmph. She... Would you believe me if I told you that she doesn't have the heart to do that?
[name="Ines"]  You killed the leader that the Regent sent. She's not the only one who wants to take over, so she has her hands full.
[name="Ines"]  Like the agreement you had with W.

[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=2)]
[name="Scout"]  ...Good.
[name="Scout"]  You've all... changed. W was not the kind of person to go out of her way to remember the names of the dead.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Yeah, she did change. But she's only become more of a lunatic.
[name="Ines"]  Your experience on the battlefield is pure, like Faust's Arts. Who's to say that this wasn't just a ruse to trip you up? What if she only wrote down their names so I could toy with you with my Arts?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=2)]
[name="Scout"]  ...That sounds like her. She would never miss an opportunity to have some fun.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  Same with you. Didn't you also agree to this crazy deal that only W could come up with?
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=2)]
[name="Scout"]  Trading my life for an opportunity, then letting those who should take that opportunity follow through? There's nothing crazy about that.
[name="Scout"]  Just like those who sacrificed their lives. They died for their own ideals. Without them, I cannot succeed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_052",name2="avg_npc_026",focus=1)]
[name="Ines"]  ...It seems like everyone's changed with the passing of time.
