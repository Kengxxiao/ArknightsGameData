[name="Istina"]  Ahem.
[name="Istina"]  Closure lent me this device for the purposes of... Well, the application says 'recording self-diagnosis and treatment of trauma using exposure therapy and related methods.'
[name="Istina"]  A mouthful indeed.
[name="Istina"]  It is a very simple machine to operate. I just check that the battery is charged, toggle this switch... And now it will record automatically.
[name="Istina"]  Phew...
[name="Istina"]  (Talking to yourself is so difficult.)
[name="Istina"]  (I honestly thought it would be easier to just open up to a screen.)
[name="Istina"]  When I asked about alleviating or at least controlling my symptoms, the medical staff suggested this...
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2")]
[name="Istina"]  'Why not try talking it through with yourself...?' They made it sound so easy.
[name="Istina"]  Okay, we have video now. Not that I'll be showing this to anyone. Not that I would ever want to show this to anyone.
[name="Istina"]  Calm down, Istina. No need to be nervous. We're all friends here. Just speak your mind. Let it out.
[name="Istina"]  All those things you've been unable to share with others, you can say to yourself. Over and over again.
[name="Istina"]  It's certainly a feasible idea.
[name="Istina"]  So let's take us back...
[name="Istina"]  While it may seem like there's nothing wrong, I know, sooner or later, we will have to deal with this. With so much.
[name="Istina"]  I know that Gummy and Natalya can never forget those things. What happened in the school... what happened after we left the school... No one could forget.
[name="Istina"]  And Zima, she... I think she has been having nightmares recently. Leto seems like she was able to let it go, but... can someone ever truly let it go?
[name="Istina"]  As for me? I believe I can face up to it. But can I, actually...?
[name="Istina"]  No one will speak of it. But somehow we will have to come to terms with it, in the end.

[name="Istina"]  Let's begin, for real this time.
[name="Istina"]  I suppose I'll introduce myself first?
[name="Istina"]  (Deep breath)
[name="Istina"]  I am called 'Istina'——This is, of course, a codename. My true name is Anna Morozova.
[name="Istina"]  Mmm. It's a name I've not heard in a long time. It is my name, of course, but it feels somewhat unfamiliar. How strange.

[name="Istina"]  This is Vika. A good friend of mine.
[name="Istina"]  Vika was my best friend before I joined the Student Self-Governing Group.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2")]
[name="Istina"]  Now I live at the headquarters of an organization called Rhodes Island, where I am classified as part of the 'Ursus Student Self-Governing Group.'
[name="Istina"]  Mm. This group was my idea, but it was Zima who truly founded it. And while we are indeed independent, at the moment there are only five of us.
[name="Istina"]  Zima, Natalya, Leto, Gummy, and myself.
[name="Istina"]  There used to be more. But we are the only ones left.
[name="Istina"]  Ah, of course, Vika is also a member.
[name="Istina"]  We currently serve as 'Operators' for this Rhodes Island... I suppose it's a kind of job.
[name="Istina"]  I don't mind it. Fair pay for fair work.
[name="Istina"]  Zima has no plans to leave, for the time being. And although she does not speak her mind, I know she is satisfied here. And from time to time, I find myself thinking it would be nice to stay.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2")]
[name="Istina"]  ...Phew.
[name="Istina"]  The truth is, while we're all together now, we did not come from the same school.
[name="Istina"]  Gummy, Natalya, and I attended the same high school. Zima and Leto went to another one.
[name="Istina"]  Oh, but Zima was sort of famous, even at our school. In fact, every student in the district knew about her.
[name="Istina"]  I suppose she is something of a born leader. I recognize that she was the right choice to lead us.
[name="Istina"]  Reunion found us defenseless and occupied Chernobog, our city.
[name="Istina"]  Then some... things... happened. Reunion took a handful of kids from our school, me among them, and marched us over to Zima's campus.
[name="Istina"]  There may have been students from other schools there too. I'm not certain. It was a chaotic time.
[name="Istina"]  It's still not clear why they did it. But it was all orchestrated by the white-haired boy leading that Reunion outfit.
[name="Istina"]  I think he may have been even younger than us? I don't know.
[name="Istina"]  I got the impression he had to convince the other leaders to round up the students, at which point they locked us inside Zima's school.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#6")]
[name="Istina"]  Looking back now, it all seems ridiculous.
[name="Istina"]  We were locked in there for maybe two weeks, and...

[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Hm? Oh, that one. Yes, you have a good eye.
[name="Istina"]  This is the most precious title in the series. The final act in the story of the world's greatest detective... Hmph, I had to beg the Doctor over and over again to help me hunt it down.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Oh, that reminds me... Back in the old country, I saw what I'm pretty sure was a signed copy of the first edition on the bookshelf at home.

[name="May"]  Oh, well... I did, but it's been so long, you see. It's about time for a reread.

[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Hm.
[name="Istina"]  When you put it that way, I suppose I ought to lend it to you. For now.

[name="May"]  I'll never give up! I've staked my reputation as a Royal Detective——
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Personally, I think you've long since forfeited your reputation as a Royal Detective.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Why you...! Hmph. I've had just about enough of you!
[name="May"]  The point is, we only happened to bump into each other on the way here.
[name="May"]  What's more, the last book I borrowed from you was absolutely riveting. I just had to come talk about it as soon as I turned the last page!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Well, that's not entirely off the table...
[name="Istina"]  It's been a while since I had a good talk about detective novels. And the plot in that one is indeed one of my favorites. 'Riveting,' you said?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  I most certainly did! How does one even come up with such a twisty plot? Ooh, I swear my hair stood on ends as I read the final reveal!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  I'm sure. It's a perfect cocktail of literary creativity and logical deduction that jabs the reader right in the psyche. Easily my favorite one in the series.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Oh——I see. It's so clear to me!
[name="May"]  It was written in the first person, so... The murderer was actually the protag——mmffst. Mmffmm?!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#4", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Fool! You can't just spoil the whole thing! Natalya hasn't read it yet!

[name="May"]  Mmmmmpf!
[name="May"]  Pfah——Haah! You almost killed me...
[name="May"]  Nnng! I bit my tongue. That hurt. I understand not wanting spoilers, but that was way out of line, Istina!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#4", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Interesting. You really like your detective novels, eh, Anna? I don't usually see you so excited to talk about something.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Oh? R- really?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Really. In fact, I think you'll have to let me read one too. Since they're clearly so compelling.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  You want to read too, Natalya? I never would have imagined. Every time I asked you before, you'd say the same thing: 'When I have time.'
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Huh. Is that right...?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  But when I see the two of you crowing on about these books, I can't help but want to join in.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  All right then. The more the merrier.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  There really aren't many people here who can hold a conversation about great art... The Doctor reads, but finding time for a conversation is no simple task.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Natalya"]  The Doctor... Ah, you mean that one commander.
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="May"]  I see you're familiar, Natalya?
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  I am. That one is quite a unique presence on this vessel. And I've had the pleasure of bearing witness to that particular commander's field operations.
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="May"]  It's too bad. There's some special meeting or some-such on today. I wanted to give the Doctor a biscuit.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Don't worry, I'm sure Hibiscus will make sure the Doctor gets a share.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes. Dr. Kal'tsit keeps a close eye, but it's clear that everyone is just as concerned about the Doctor.
[name="Natalya"]  The medical staff, in particular. I went for a test recently and overheard several medics discussing adjustments to the Doctor's diet... I believe the confiscation of snacks was mentioned?
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="May"]  Hahahaha. That's a fairly reasonable step, no?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Gummy was moaning about that too. Honestly, what does that one eat every day?
[name="Istina"]  Also, what was that about a 'test,' Natalya?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh, I would appreciate some discretion in this matter. I haven't made up my mind yet, but... it is why I came here today.
[name="Natalya"]  However...
[name="Natalya"]  Now's not the time, actually. Let's come back to it another day.
[name="Natalya"]  You'll know soon, Anna. In all likelihood.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Oh?
[name="Istina"]  All right then. I won't pry.
[name="Istina"]  Ahem, let's get back to the matter at hand. Why don't we start Natalya off with the classics?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh, is that the matter at hand then?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Hehe, it's an excellent opportunity to introduce a friend to your beloved hobby.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  I wouldn't let this go so easily.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Ooh... you're positively oozing passion right now.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  But of course!
[name="Istina"]  Don't underestimate the power of the detective novel. No matter the type, a masterwork carries a living soul within it.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Heh heh. That's an Annaism if I've ever heard one. But that doesn't make it any less true.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Reasoning out the plot of a novel is part of the fun, but the true draw of the detective genre goes much deeper.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Istina speaks the truth, but I have to say my favorite part is always when the detective unmasks the true culprit.
[name="May"]  And if we're talking classics, we of course have to talk about 'that one,' eh?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  'That one?' Do you mean...?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  'That one!' Yes!
[name="May"]  Ahem.
[name="May"]  'One truth prevails! The murderer is——You!'
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh, I know that one. It's a detective's catchphrase.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Righto. No matter how many times I hear it, it still gets my heart racing!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Indeed.
[name="Istina"]  But in my opinion, it's after the culprit is found that the real thinking, the real interesting bit begins.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  What do you mean?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Allow me to answer your question with another question, May. Upon cornering the criminal, and after arriving at the truth, what is it the detective should do?
[name="Istina"]  Should she announce the truth to everyone, securing a conviction?
[name="Istina"]  Even when the truth is clear, the law may from time to time be an ineffective remedy. What then, can she do?
[name="Istina"]  Does she allow this criminal to get away with his crimes? Or does she take the law into her own hands?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Such things happen in the real world too. With no simple solution.
[name="Natalya"]  If I were her...
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  ...Hmm.
[name="May"]  Did you just want to drop that one on us?
[name="May"]  What are you even talking about, Istina? You've been acting off all day. Are you feeling alright?
[name="May"]  ...No, no fever?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  ...I'm sorry?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  A detective's duty is to uncover the truth. The rest is up to the police, of course. She can't play judge, jury, and executioner.
[name="May"]  Every part of the justice system plays a role. The police, the courts, and detectives like us. Isn't that obvious?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  What's that face now? Did I say something so shocking?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Of course I know a detective can't legally convict a criminal.
[name="Istina"]  I just never expected to hear you talk sense...
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Hey now! What's that supposed to mean?!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Nothing. Just talking to myself.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Now, given the world we live in, we've got a fair number of people who pass their days killing and killing. Murder may not seem a crime of particularly immediate concern, but we'll set that aside for the moment.
[name="May"]  It remains our duty, as detectives, to seek out the truth and uphold the law to the best of our abilities.
[name="May"]  We may not pass judgment. We may not go above the law. We may not exact our own justice.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  ......
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  To do harm to others, no matter how we may package it, is an immoral act. The character of such behavior is immutable.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Indeed. You're right...
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Whether or not the crime is ever known to others, whether or not judgment is ever passed, the knowledge of the crime lives forever within the criminal.
[name="May"]  And it is the detective who digs out that truth! Ah ha! Just saying things like that feels so stupendously cool!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  The knowledge of the crime...
[name="Istina"]  ......
[name="Istina"]  You're right.
[name="Istina"]  No matter the justification, regardless of whether or not it is known to the world, what's done is done.
[name="Istina"]  And someday...
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh my, our little chat here has turned rather dour.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  ...Sorry. I shouldn't have brought it up.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Oh no, it was quite the enlightening discussion to witness. But on the rare occasion we meet again for afternoon tea, let's discuss something a bit lighter.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Yes. Good idea.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  The tea's gone cold.
[name="May"]  Hm? Is that...?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  What is it, May? You stood up just to have something catch your eye?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  It's, well, see for yourselves. What's that outside the window?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Hm? The window? Let me see.
[name="Natalya"]  Oh, it's... flying? And flying this way.
[name="Natalya"]  Looks like some sort of drone?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  A drone?
[name="Istina"]  It is a drone... But what is it doing out here? Actually, I think it's caught on the rigging.

[name="May"]  Oh, but there's a note taped to the drone!
[name="May"]  And it's for you, Natalya.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1#2")]
[name="Natalya"]  Huh? For me?
[name="Natalya"]  Let me see.

[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3")]
[name="Istina"]  Ah!
[name="Istina"]  May...
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Hm?
[name="May"]  Wow, what happened? You look like you've seen a ghost!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#6", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  ...I'm fine.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#6", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Are you sure? You're definitely not sick? I wouldn't think any less of you.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  *Sigh*...
[name="Istina"]  Fool.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  What?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#5", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  What kind of absolute moron would dive out a window and go hanging from the rigging just to get her hands on a mysterious drone?
[name="Istina"]  A woman with a brain would use a tool, or ask me to use my Arts!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#5", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Well I didn't think of that, okay?!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#5", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Use your head next time!

Don't scare me like that. Idiot.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Give me your hand.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Eh? No need for that, I'm really okay.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  You scratched your hand on the windowsill.
[name="Istina"]  Don't play dumb with me. I see right through you. You have a terrible poker face.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Ugh.
[name="May"]  Your eyes are way too sharp.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  As a 'junior detective,' keen powers of observation are a must, no?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Ack.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Well, it's not a deep cut. We'll just wipe it clean, apply some disinfectant... and we're done.
[name="Istina"]  But you'll still want to have a medic operator look at it, no matter how small the wound.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  It's nothing serious. Don't get so worked up!
[name="May"]  But thanks all the same. Hehe.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  *Sigh*.
[Character(name="char_197_poca_1")]
[name="Natalya"]  The note is a summons from Silence.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Dr. Silence?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#3", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Yes, it's about the test I mentioned before.
[name="Natalya"]  But it's kind of scary. How did Dr. Silence know I was here?
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="May"]  Anything's possible with drones, right? From Dr. Kal'tsit on down, the medics all have their ways...
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  That's for sure.
[name="Natalya"]  Sorry, Anna, it seems I'm off to Medical.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  No problem. It's clearly something important. Go take care of it.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=2)]
[name="May"]  Well, I'd better be on my way then too.
[name="May"]  I've returned your book, and borrowed another. A complete success!
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_133_mm_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  What's a complete success?
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Let's do this again soon.
[name="Natalya"]  If all goes well, I'm looking forward to telling the whole Self-Governing Group the good news.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=1)]
[name="Istina"]  Yes. As am I.
[Character(name="char_195_glassb_2#2", name2="char_197_poca_1",focus=2)]
[name="Natalya"]  Anna...
[name="Natalya"]  ......
[name="Natalya"]  Nothing. Forget it.
[name="Natalya"]  Until next time.
[Character(name="char_133_mm_1")]
[name="May"]  Toodle-oo~

[name="Istina"]  Is such a thing possible? Yes, I think so too.
[name="Istina"]  ......
[name="Istina"]  I have never forgotten about you. About what happened to you.
[name="Istina"]  Would you blame me, if I did? You would, wouldn't you?
[name="Istina"]  No? I know that's not true. I know you, Vika. And I know that's a lie. In fact, I know you can't speak at all.
[name="Istina"]  You've been with me for so long. You're still by my side today.
[name="Istina"]  One day, we must all come to terms...
[name="Istina"]  ...But not today. Not now.
[name="Istina"]  It seems... I am not strong enough. I still can't do it. Not yet.
