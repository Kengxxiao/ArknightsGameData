Gummy is the second one in her dorm to wake up every morning. And she has a habit.
As soon as Istina wakes her, they share a handshake. Gummy then goes next door to wake Zima in the same fashion.
Whether 'The General' decides to shake her hand or not depends entirely on her mood.

Rhodes Island Dormitories - Zima, Istina, and Gummy's Quarters
[Dialog]
Gummy goes back home alone.
She does not turn on the lights.
She hangs her 'shield' in the corner,
And makes her way inside.
She did nothing wrong.
And yet she is sad.
She wants to do better, for everyone who does so much to help her.
She failed.
Since coming to Rhodes Island, Gummy's 'habits' only bred more habits.
And she knows those habits bother the people around her.
But she can't change.
She can do nothing but keep on being 'Gummy.'

[name="Gummy"]  Phew. That was great. But now it's bedtime.
[name="Gummy"]  Just need my trusty night light...
[name="Gummy"]  Huh? It's not turning on?
[name="Gummy"]  Did the bulb burn out?

[name="Gummy"]  Are you sleeping with us too?
[name="Zima"]  Uh, I guess so.
[name="Zima"]  Hey, Istina?
[name="Zima"]  Can the three of us really fit in Gummy's bed?
[name="Istina"]  Just squeeze in tight.
[name="Zima"]  Guess we're making a Gummy bear sandwich.
[name="Gummy"]  Fine by me.
[name="Zima"]  All right. Just tell me if it gets too hot and stuffy. I'll go back to my room.
