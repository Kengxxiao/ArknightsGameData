[name="Woman"]  Do you really have to go?
[name="Woman"]  I saw the news. Things are heating up between the mob and the police.
[name="Woman"]  I saw blood. Lots of people bleeding...
[name="Man"]  Don't worry, honey, things aren't that bad.
[name="Man"]  It's just the media playing things up. 'If it bleeds, it leads,' you know. That's how they get paid.
[name="Man"]  Don't let them scare you.
[name="Woman"]  But...
[name="Woman"]  The man at the smoke shop says not so many nobles come by for liquor anymore. And Aunt Nina, who works at Lord Santelli's estate, came home. She says the Lord's entire staff is furloughed.
[name="Woman"]  Don't you think... don't you think that means——
[name="Man"]  Enough!
[name="Woman"]  ......
[name="Man"]  ...Sorry. I shouldn't have raised my voice. 
[name="Woman"]  Loban, I'm just... I'm just so worried.
[name="Man"]  I said not to worry. Don't be scared. I'm here. You can trust me. I will protect you. 
[name="Man"]  And it's not only me. I have the rest of the Guard garrison with me, and the Army is just outside the city too. There's nothing to be afraid of.
[name="Woman"]  Loban...
[name="Man"]  Relax, Darya. We swore to protect this city, and this home. 
[name="Man"]  Let's not trouble your pretty little head. This winter will pass, and when the weather warms up, we'll go someplace nice. How does that sound?
[name="Man"]  And don't tell Zoya. Let it be just the two of us, off on a romantic getaway. Alright?
[name="Woman"]  ...hehe.
[name="Woman"]  How are you still like this, even at your age?
[name="Woman"]  It's so cold. Where are we going to go for a romantic getaway when the snow melts and the roads turn to mud?
[name="Man"]  Isn't that the perfect way to end the winter? When the time comes, we'll go dancing, you'll bring some mead from home, and I'll bake you cookies myself.
[name="Woman"]  Oho, bold words. Do you still remember how? I think... we could. Just wait for Zoya to go back to school. When she's safely in her dormitory, we'll head off.
[name="Man"]  Sure! Now, how long until school starts? Could we move her in early?
[name="Woman"]  Nonsense!
[name="Woman"]  Zoya? We were just talking about you. Come, your father's on the night shift. Say goodbye.

There were happy moments that at the time erupted suddenly with such potency, they brought an unparalleled sense of being.
Or maybe they felt very ordinary. Only in retrospect do I realize what the feeling was.
Everyday conversations for a monotonous life.
As if spring would come as usual. As if the snow would melt, the people would tie the hay into straw men, and trample about the mud amidst the aroma of pale mead.
The usual greetings: good morning, good evening, hello, goodbye.
Until that day——
Our city, before our very eyes, twisted, deformed, erupted.

[name="Reunion Squad Leader"]  That school is a ways away from the one they stationed us at. And if Mephisto is up to something, there's not much we can do...

[name="Reunion Squad Leader"]  But yeah, it's normal to be angry.... with what he did this time.

[name="Valery"]  The Army has not come. But our comms are working fine. We have no idea what's going on with them.
[name="Valery"]  It's just us Guardsmen. There's not much we can do to stop them. But at least you'll be a little safer with us.

[name="???"]  What is he doing over there?

[name="Valery"]  Haven't you heard? The Infected locked up another group of kids in Peterheim, just like your school.
[name="Valery"]  It's weird. They don't seem to be doing anything to them. No movement out of there.
[name="Valery"]  But there's been some news in the last few days. Reunion seems to be pulling out. No matter what they're up to, we have to have a countermeasure in place.
[name="Valery"]  We can't spare much manpower. Only a few districts are calm, and others are so out of control that we could only send a small team to Peterheim.
[Character(name="char_405_absin_ed_1")]
[name="???"]  Meaning, my dad?

[name="???"]  I've watched how they operate at my school. I know how they patrol, I know how many men they put in a squad.
[name="???"]  It's a different school, but their tactics should be pretty much the same...
[name="???"]  I've been to Peterheim before. I know the campus layout. And I managed to dodge Reunion all the way here.

[name="Valery"]  It's supposed to connect to military comm networks. I'm not sure if it still works.
[name="Valery"]  If you're lucky, you can make contact with the Army once you reach Peterheim. If you can report the situation to them from there, that would be a big help.
[name="Valery"]  I know I can't stop you. Honestly, I have too much on my plate right now to worry about watching you. What you do now is entirely on you.
[name="Valery"]  But... Zoya, bear in mind, you are not a public servant. We are here to protect you.
