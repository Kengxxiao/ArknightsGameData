[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] The purpose of today's training is to learn how to handle the L-44 'Gramophone' Arts unit. Semi-autonomous arts units such as these are becoming increasingly popularized in certain countries, so we'll have to master their operation.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ansel")] Woah, that enemy is casting Arts into a Gramophone! What's he trying to accomplish?
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] This is how the enemies will attempt to <@tu.kw>seize control</> of a Gramophone. We'll either have to come up with a way of stopping him, or take control of the Gramophone ourselves.
[Tutorial(focusX=30, focusY=60, focusWidth=220, focusHeight=220, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Certain special enemies will use their Arts to alter the operating protocol of the Gramophones in order to <@tu.kw>take control</> of them.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_snakek")] What should we do then?
[Tutorial(focusX=-160, focusY=60, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Disrupt the enemy's Arts, and deploy Operators at the <@tu.kw>Protocol Entries</> near a Gramophone to <@tu.kw>take control</> of it.
[Tutorial(focusX=-58, focusY=-40, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=110, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightCircle", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
The Originium lines beneath each <@tu.kw>Protocol Entry</> will resonate, and controlling multiple <@tu.kw>Protocol Entries</> can <@tu.kw>speed up the rate</> at which you take control of Gramophones.
[Tutorial(focusX=-52, focusY=18, focusWidth=106, focusHeight=30, \
          animStyle="Highlight", focusStyle="HighlightRect", black="$f_tut_black", \
          protectTime=0.5, dialogHead="$avatar_doberm", dialogX="$f_lower_dialog_pos_x", dialogY="$f_lower_dialog_pos_y")] \
Furthermore, <@tu.kw>control</> over the Gramophone is determined by its <@tu.kw>Charge Gauge</>. When reaching <@tu.imp>0%</>, the Gramophone will <@tu.imp>fall under the enemy's control</>; Conversely, when reaching <@tu.kw>100%</>, the Gramophone will enter <@tu.kw>our control</>.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_doberm")] Right now, the best way to understand how to control the L-44 'Gramophone' is with practice.
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ansel")] Understood!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_snakek")] There are other enemies coming, but I'll take care of them!
