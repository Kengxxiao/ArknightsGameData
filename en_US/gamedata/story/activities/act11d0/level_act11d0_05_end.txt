[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]

[name="Severin"]  ——*cough*, get some heavies and come with me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Townsfolk"]  But they have firepower, and maybe hostages. We shouldn't provoke them any more. Let's wait for a chance to parley.

[name="???"]  But his concerns are reasonable. The active Originium left behind by the Great Rift are likely still in the foundation of Wolumonde. The consequences of letting them destroy it would be unthinkable.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Townsfolk"]  Where did you come from? You shouldn't be here!
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#3")]
[name="Severin"]  No.
[name="Severin"]  With no Gendarmerie, we're the ones who shouldn't be here... I've seen you before, Rhodes Island Operators.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Thank you for understanding. Ayerscarpe?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer", name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  A quick, on-the-spot assessment: if they continue to bombard the area with that device, we have ten to thirty minutes before Wolumonde comes to a halt.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  The best way to handle this would be to sever the link between this district and the rest of the city, but Wolumonde is no nomadic city. Individual districts do not have the power to move autonomously.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  Actually, a tractor could do it... But not when the streets are full of rebels.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Is there an application procedure for an armed intervention?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=2)]
[name="Severin"]  ...Go nuts.
[name="Severin"]  And please... Be sure to save Tatjana and Folinic.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3")]
[name="Suzuran"]  Mr. Severin, we need— Ah!
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  ...Lisa?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Is... is that Operator GreyThroat? And who's this?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Operator Ayerscarpe, bodyguard of Catastrophe Messenger Leonhardt. He is out on another mission, so I got dragged over here.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Lisa, where are Atro and Folinic?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Miss Folinic is still in there! But Miss Atro... she's... um...
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  It's okay. I understand. I just had to be sure... We'll talk about it later.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1",focus=2)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Mmm... It's, it's nice to have some senior operators coming to help...
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Suzuran"]  B-but I still need to stay focused!
[name="Suzuran"]  I'll take care of the wounded. Whatever you do, please bring Miss Folinic back safely!
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="char_358_lisa_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Right. I will.
