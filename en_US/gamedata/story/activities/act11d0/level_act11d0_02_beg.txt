[name="Folinic"]  The way they were acting, I know what it means. I know it all too well...
[name="Folinic"]  But... But Atro wouldn't get herself into trouble. She knows Leithanien better than any of us!

[name="Suzuran"]  Yeah! I'm sure she's fine!

[name="Suzuran"]  Isn't this place eerily quiet?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Yes. Stay close.
[name="Folinic"]  I'm seeing plenty of Infected among the citizenry, but that's not the main point.
[name="Folinic"]  I was thinking about it when we fought those rioters before. This residential district is pretty ordinary in design, isn't it?
[name="Folinic"]  They've just gathered up all the Infected to live together. There's nothing explicitly discriminatory about it.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Hm...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  But the truth is they're still having their personal freedom restricted. And aside from a few remarkable Infected, most people live more or less like prisoners.
[name="Folinic"]  What they have is not a prison, but an entire street of cells with a dozen times more inmates.
[name="Folinic"]  Look here, how long do you think it's been since this bakery was open?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Ew... I think I saw an Originium slug crawling around... so unsanitary.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  No one's been sweeping up the dust and leaves around the door. There's no functioning economy here. No daily life.
[name="Folinic"]  I understand they've fallen on hard times, but no one wants to buy or sell bread? There's no public transit? This isn't normal.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Maybe, maybe it's because of what happened before? Like the shop owner got scared off or something?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  At least they have the right to live, they—

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  I wasn't criticizing them. I was just talking about... those 'armed Infected.'
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Do you think they're...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  That policeman mentioned 'Sarkaz.' We need to look into that first.
[name="Folinic"]  If they do have anything to do with the 'armed Infected groups' we know, we'll have to tread carefully. Things here may be far more complicated than that policeman knows.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Really?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  If the Infected are living well enough, it's only because the situation isn't desperate enough.
[name="Folinic"]  They must be hiding something from us.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Folinic?
[name="Suzuran"]  Please don't worry. Atro is very smart.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  I...
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  You've been looking very scary since that meeting. But don't worry.
[name="Suzuran"]  As long as we try really, really hard, we'll be able to handle this, just like the senior operators!
[name="Suzuran"]  So can you relax for me? At least a bit?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Aw, is little Lisa comforting me again? Why's that?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1", name2="char_345_folnic_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Hehe, let go of all your troubles, big and small!

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  It's you.
[name="Folinic"]  Didn't I say we don't need any help? All we need is access...
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#4", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Tatjana"]  I'm sorry. I know you said as much, Miss Folinic, but considering the circumstances, and your unfamiliarity with this place, we have to take precautions to guard against potential accidents.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  ...Miss Folinic?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Fine... The locals may be more welcoming if we have one of their own with us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_069", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tatjana"]  That's true! *Cough cough*! Zwölftontechnik Strasse was once Wolumonde's biggest Infected quarter...
[Character(name="avg_npc_069", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  And now, for certain reasons, it's become Wolumonde's number one protest district.
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tatjana"]  Then what do you plan to do now?
[name="Tatjana"]  I don't think it's wise to go any deeper into this place... But if you want to learn more about the situation in Wolumonde, that is a good choice.
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Let's just go for a stroll here. No need to rush things.
[name="Folinic"]  I'd be very happy if you were willing to tell me more about Dr. Atro.
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tatjana"]  You... really worry about Dr. Atro, don't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  We went to school together. And she is one of my very few trusted friends. Not to mention an employee Rhodes Island can't afford to lose.
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tatjana"]  ...I see.
[name="Tatjana"]  Ah, please come this way. Schaukelplatz is just up ahead.

[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Tatjana"]  Um... Treating the local Infected, giving psychological counseling to those who were suffering.
[name="Tatjana"]  Wolumonde was unable to avoid the Great Rift because of an error the Catastrophe Messengers made, and we suffered immensely for it.
[name="Tatjana"]  Dr. Atro could have left, but she decided to stay. After Wolumonde moored here, she set up a temporary medical facility to better serve the Infected.
[name="Tatjana"]  Dr. Atro... is their hero.
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  ...She was just doing what she had to do.
[name="Folinic"]  She's always been better at practical work than rote learning.
