[name="GreyThroat"]  One more question, Miss Tatjana. When I came here with Atro, Wolumonde was still thriving.
[name="GreyThroat"]  So what happened to all the Gendarmerie? There isn't a single one left in town.

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Winterwisp...? Hah. I'm not aboriginal, but I do acknowledge their struggle!
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  How about you? Dr. Atro was a good person, but you? You're just here to help them crush us!
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Wolumonde, no, all of Leithanien is rotten to the core! Today they burn the Infected alive, tomorrow it will be the entire working class!

[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Where's your proof?
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  There's not a single Gendarmerie in Wolumonde! Not one!
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Why do you think that is?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Wolumonde and several surrounding towns formed a collective settlement network. When the Catastrophe struck, there were not enough Gendarmerie to care for all of the—
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Oh really? If it was that simple, nobody would mind!
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  Enough stalling. Out with it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Hmph.
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  For a wedding.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  A wedding?
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Some great nobleman in his high tower married the only daughter of another nobleman, so they sent all the Gendarmerie over to the nearest nomadic city!
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  And how long do you think the aristocrats' drunken revelries are gonna last? You wanna guess?
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Oh and I almost forgot about the part where the nobles argued back and forth for a month about whose city should move to whose territory.
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  So our Gendarmerie had to go stand around some fancy mansions to boost a fortunate son's ego, and maybe keep out the riffraff. Isn't that funny? Are you laughing?
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Because I'm not.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  No, it's not funny. But that still doesn't give me any leads as to the fire.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Hmph...
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  Think about it: who's going to set fire to a medical camp that treats Infected? Would the Infected do that?
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  It could only be someone who wants to see the Infected suffer. You should be on our side—
[name="Rebellious Townsfolk"]  —The side of Reunion!

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  No. The myriad contradictions this crisis has revealed in Wolumonde can't be solved by external forces. There is nothing we could've done.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4", name2="char_367_swllow_1",focus=2)]

[name="Severin"]  People.
[name="Severin"]  Let me start by offering my sincere thanks to Rhodes Island for saving Tatjana.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Rhodes Island is an organization dedicated to helping the Infected.
[name="Folinic"]  Severin Hawthorn, Leithanien is known for its lenient treatment of the Infected. But I still have to ask, before we get down to business—
[name="Folinic"]  On behalf of Wolumonde, can you guarantee that Wolumonde has not, in light of these exceptional circumstances, taken 'additional measures' against the Infected population?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  The investigations you carried out with Miss Suzuran should have corroborated this.
[name="Severin"]  Wolumonde has in no way, at no point, targeted the Infected. Nor have we ever held ill will toward Dr. Atro, who aided the Infected.
[name="Severin"]  Are you satisfied?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  ......
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Miss Folinic, I believe Mr. Severin.
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#2", name2="char_294_ayer",focus=2)]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Why?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4", name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Um... well... I'm not sure! But I do believe him! He wouldn't hurt Infected people!
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#4", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Okay, Lisa. I'll trust your instincts, for now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  Thank you for understanding.
[name="Severin"]  Now, I'd like to hear your opinions on what to do next.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_066",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I'm not as familiar with the field as Folinic. I followed her instructions during the operation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  There aren't a lot of them out there.
[name="Folinic"]  Counting those we have successfully subdued, there can't be more than a hundred or so.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  A hundred or so rioters wouldn't be able to terrorize Wolumonde under normal circumstances.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  As for the Gendarmerie, I've heard some interesting rumors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  That was one of the very few unfortunate decisions I've made in my military career. We can't do anything about it, so let's shelve it for now.
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Allow me to interject. I'd like to discuss that captive, who called himself 'Reunion.'
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_294_ayer",focus=1)]
[name="Suzuran"]  Huh?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  We have made contact with a certain lone member of the Reunion Movement, and he has very little in common with the outraged citizenry.
[name="GreyThroat"]  He's a battle-hardened warrior. And if he came with a squad, he could be a problem.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  The partisans. This is not good news.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#3")]
[name="Folinic"]  Reunion...
[name="Folinic"]  Chernobog... Ursus... Gah... Not Ursus again...
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#5")]
[CameraShake(duration=1, xstrength=8, ystrength=6, vibrato=30, randomness=60, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Folinic"]  Why should I believe a single word they say?!
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#3")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  ......
[Character(name="char_294_ayer")]
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  The fire was the trigger for all of this. But there was always a high risk of conflict.
[name="Ayerscarpe"]  Did these underlying problems cause the fire? Or was this fire the catalyst that revealed these problems?
[Character(name="avg_npc_069#2")]
[name="Tatjana"]  Do we have a choice...? Do we have to fight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  This is the choice that decides the fate of Wolumonde. Thousands of lives hang in the balance. We can't be hasty.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  We should return to the Rathaus for a formal resolution.
