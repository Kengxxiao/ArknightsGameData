[name="Folinic"]  The quarantine zone is right near here. Everything seems to have gone back to peace and quiet after we drove off the protestors.

[name="Folinic"]  You're right, it's not that different. They have shops, cafés, ads for music halls and art salons...
[name="Folinic"]  No one's getting rounded up by guards and sent out to the tundra to die. They get to live pretty ordinary lives... You might even say they live well.

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  I'm kidding... The fact that Infected can roam the streets freely only serves to underscore how special the situation in Wolumonde is.

[name="Folinic"]  Shh! Lower your voice! We'll talk once the officer is gone!
[name="Folinic"]  The Infected rebels are acting really weird. And they keep talking about a 'fire' and a 'doctor,' right?
[name="Folinic"]  Add in that officer who definitely knows who we are, and who really doesn't want to tell me anything about Atro...
[name="Folinic"]  And I can't shake the feeling that something rotten is brewing in this town.
[name="Folinic"]  Even Leithanien wouldn't go so far as to let the Infected riot in the streets. Where are the guards? Why isn't anyone stopping them?
[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_358_lisa_1#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]

[name="Severin"]  The truth is flippant. It's simple. No need to sugar coat it. You're angry now, but you're not surprised. You already guessed it, didn't you?
[name="Severin"]  We received the Infected doctor who called herself 'Atro.' And we greatly appreciate her help caring for the many Infected residents of Wolumonde during this difficult time.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#3", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]

[name="Severin"]  I know what you're thinking. But according to what we currently know, it seemed to be an accident.

[name="Severin"]  ...I'm very sorry.
[name="Severin"]  If I'm not going to talk lightly, all I can give you is 'I'm very sorry.'
[name="Severin"]  Dr. Atro is a good egg. She's got no Leithanian blood. No connection to us at all, really. And yet she's nobler than anybody around here.
[name="Severin"]  And when the Catastrophe struck Wolumonde, she didn't run away. She offered us help.
[name="Severin"]  I have the utmost respect for the good doctor. I hope nothing happened to her.
[name="Severin"]  But after the fire, you saw it yourself, some of the Infected folks don't have the same ideas.
[name="Severin"]  Not that I blame them. The town's cut off from the outside world. We're short on supplies. And a gang of armed Infected are out there circling.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Armed Infected?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Outlanders. All of them Infected, all of them armed. Most are Leithanian, but there are a few devils among them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  The term is 'Sarkaz,' please. I hope the meaning of the word is not lost on you. Do you have any other information about the armed Infected?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  They're merely vultures waiting to pick our bones. And they're not the first.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Oh? So why didn't they immediately show up to plunder the town? Why are they just 'loitering' out there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Just come out with it already.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Wolumonde's lack of sensitivity toward the Infected is understandable.
[name="Folinic"]  After all, it's a miracle Leithanien was letting infected people live alongside non-infected people for so long—
[name="Folinic"]  —But it's also an opportunity for bad actors to take advantage of such leniency.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  I told you, Rhodes Island isn't just a bunch of doctors. We're also experts at dealing with the Infected.
[name="Folinic"]  There are some areas... where I'd rather trust our own judgment.
[name="Folinic"]  For example... have you ever heard of the 'Reunion Movement?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Before the Great Rift, I saw that name in the newspapers from time to time. Mostly reports from Ursus, but occasionally in Leithanien.
[name="Severin"]  But to a small tourist town, it doesn't mean much. Folks around here would rather listen to the gossip from the next town over than official reports on faraway countries.
[name="Severin"]  What are you getting at? You think Reunion has something to do with this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  No, I don't want to jump to conclusions. Let's leave it there for now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  Right... *Cough*. Either way, thanks for the info.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Speaking from experience, I don't think your side of the story will have much influence on our mission.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  That's too bad. But honestly, I didn't expect much.
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  We may have to do some investigating around town. We need to find out what the deal with this 'disappearance' is...
[name="Folinic"]  Rhodes Island will demand the necessary compensation from the relevant people.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  Er...
[Character(name="avg_npc_066")]
[name="Severin"]  ...Understood.
[name="Severin"]  I've no reason to argue with that face of yours.
[name="Severin"]  You can move about the town freely, as Dr. Atro's associates. You are honored guests of Wolumonde.
[Character(name="avg_npc_068")]
[name="Councilor"]  Ah! But of course! Please, make yourselves at home here. Upstairs is the Wolumonde government's finest parlor.
[name="Councilor"]  You must be tired from your long journey? Please, take a rest upstairs while we—
[Character(name="avg_npc_068", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  No need. I have something to attend to.
[name="Folinic"]  Can we start our investigation now?
[Character(name="avg_npc_066", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Severin"]  We'll prepare the paperwork and notify the residents after the meeting. As you wish.
