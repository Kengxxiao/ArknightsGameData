[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Mudrock, they're hunting down the last fugitives.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  They could have just left the fugitives to fend for themselves in the mountains. Capturing them will save their lives.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  I can't tell if they're being cruel or kind.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  The ones who didn't follow us are not our problem, but...
[name="Mudrock"]  Try to avoid the search parties. We need to get out of here before winter.
[name="Mudrock"]  It's already cold.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  And go where?
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  We've been wandering for so long. Where does it end? It definitely won't end well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Then, let's go home.
[name="Mudrock"]  We go back and find a quiet patch of woods. And we survive.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  What about our fight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  For now... we live.
[name="Mudrock"]  To live, just to live, we are fighting the world every day.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  We're going home? To what home?
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Kazdel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  Huh...
[name="Armed Infected"]  But what about us? We're not Sarkaz. That's...
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  You are companions of Sarkaz.
[name="Mudrock"]  There may be no place for Sarkaz outside of Kazdel. But in Kazdel, there is a place for you.
[name="Mudrock"]  Not because of tolerance. But because there is... nothing there.
[name="Mudrock"]  Kazdel... is not a city. Not a country. Technically, it is just a region.
[name="Mudrock"]  A land of exiles where we are not allowed to build homes.
[name="Mudrock"]  Kazdel... is where the homeless go. A land of rootless people.
[name="Mudrock"]  It is where you belong.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067")]
[name="Armed Infected"]  Thank you.
[name="Armed Infected"]  Maybe we can live in peace in Kazdel. It's full of Infected Sarkaz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Leithanien's leniency toward the Infected is ultimately just a product of the popularity of bloodlines and Originium Arts. It doesn't mean they truly accept you.
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  As soon as the mask came off, the very first to be ostracized were still the Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  It's not just Oripathy. This rich country has forgotten all the depressed corners of our world.
[name="Armed Infected"]  A tragedy like Wolumonde's is just a mild annoyance for the aristocrats. It's a topic of conversation for the bankers and court artists at tea time.
[name="Armed Infected"]  We can't accept it. We won't.
[name="Armed Infected"]  So we leave. We'll go to Kazdel. Let's see your hometown.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Mm...
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=2)]
[name="Sarkaz Warrior"]  Will Leithanien come after us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="avg_npc_053",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Maybe. Regardless of what happened before, a group of Infected Sarkaz showed up and destroyed a town. Piss-poor optics.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  Severin knows the truth. Would he try to frame us?
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  He would.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  .......
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  It's just the way he does things. Based on the information he has, he will do what causes the least amount of damage to his town.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="Armed Infected"]  Then we have to get out of here quickly, or all of Leithanien is going to come down on us.
[Character(name="avg_npc_067", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Yes. So we must figure out a route soon... Oh...
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  Sorry. Wait a moment. I have to go somewhere.
[name="Mudrock"]  Very quick.

[name="Folinic"]  So that's where you were.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Operator Folinic.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  No, don't get up. I won't get too close to you.
[name="Folinic"]  You're waiting for someone, aren't you?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Yes.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  I wasn't on the Rhodes Island landship when the Reunion incident happened. You... changed a lot.
[name="Folinic"]  You're very different from what the rumors say about you.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Rumors?
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  I heard you fought alongside an elite operator to solve a lot of the problems in Lungmen.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#3")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  ...a big, dumb, reckless cat who gets blood everywhere.
[name="GreyThroat"]  And we weren't able to solve... anything.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  ...Thank you.
[name="Folinic"]  I have to thank you again. I don't know how things would have turned out without you and Lisa.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#3")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  ......
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  Rhodes Island, Severin, even Reunion. No one wanted it to come to this.
[name="Folinic"]  Everyone was fighting to stop the tragedy, but we were powerless.
[name="Folinic"]  Atro, she...
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Don't push yourself to mourn anything or anyone. It's over now.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#3")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Just pray for the dead to rest in peace.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  We failed to bring the killer to justice. Not only that, we failed to protect the town Atro gave her life for.
[name="Folinic"]  She would have blamed me, wouldn't she?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Only you would blame yourself. Atro was a cheerful, open-minded woman.
[name="GreyThroat"]  She would slap you on the shoulder and get drunk with you.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#2")]
[name="Folinic"]  Heh... you're right. Seems like you knew her well?
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I know a certain 'elite operator' she liked to get drunk with.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  We're not the only ones who have given up on chasing all this.

[name="GreyThroat"]  You came.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Here, freshly picked wildflowers...
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You should be aware of the situation at hand. The cleanup mission is nearing completion and Rhodes Island will be leaving the area soon to try to contact Resource Dispatch for assistance.
[name="GreyThroat"]  But when that happens...
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  No one will speak for us. I know.
[name="Mudrock"]  I don't blame Severin. This is the only thing he can tell the nobles, or his people will be the ones to suffer.
[name="Mudrock"]  We too will leave here soon. It's just that, some of our people died here... I don't want to leave without saying goodbye.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  ...Eight Infected.
[name="Folinic"]  But not, the number of casualties in Wolumonde is hundreds of times greater than that.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  Sorry.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  No... it's not your fault. I wasn't blaming you.
[name="Folinic"]  I'm just reflecting on it. Thinking about how it came to this.
[name="Folinic"]  Of course, I know the world is not fair. Good things don't come to good people. But also... rarely have I ever seen such self-destructiveness.
[name="Folinic"]  Fomented anger and lust for revenge nearly destroyed everything... even me.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You're still blaming yourself.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  No... I've calmed down past that. I'm only reevaluating, maybe what I thought was 'done wrong' just 'couldn't be done.'
[name="Folinic"]  Everything from Rhodes Island, everything Dr. Kal'tsit taught me... I just couldn't do it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  No one could.
[name="Mudrock"]  I stopped them from crossing the line, but one or two stops can't quench their vengeful rage.
[name="Mudrock"]  So... things are the way they are.
[Character(name="char_345_folnic_1#4")]
[name="Folinic"]  ......
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  What are you going to do next? 'Reunion' is still a big problem for many people. You should let go of that symbol.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  You're right. But 'Reunion' is not dead. And this news has spread among the Infected in Leithanien.
[name="Mudrock"]  The fire of resistance continues to burn... twisted and distorted as it is. We must take a moment to catch our breaths.
[name="Mudrock"]  There are too many in my squad with no combat experience. I can't decide their fate. They... perhaps they just want to live in peace.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Say... Rhodes Island, have you ever heard the name 'Big Bob?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  No.
[name="Folinic"]  If there's a connection, I could search the archives.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  No. There isn't. He's just a friend of mine...
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Reunion? Or Sarkaz?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Reunion. He is an experienced bounty hunter.
[name="Mudrock"]  They are not warriors, so they had a reason to get out... They should free themselves from oppression and seek a place for themselves among the Columbian pioneers.
[name="Mudrock"]  Ah, come to think of it, they have hops.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  What?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Have you ever seen hops? How does it work? You crush it up into beer?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Um, it's a fine plant... it has something to do with the beer foam. Um, I think it prolongs the antiseptic—
[name="Folinic"]  No. I don't really have to explain this, do I? I'm not that familiar with it.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1#3")]
[name="GreyThroat"]  Let's just say, it's very handy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  I see. Lucky.
[name="Mudrock"]  Hops... foam... beer...
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Hey, don't get lost thinking about beer. We're still enemies here.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  We may never be able to bridge our differences.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  Oh... sorry.
[name="Mudrock"]  We are warriors. Sarkaz are warriors.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  I have to say... it's hard to feel your warrior spirit from your words and actions.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  We had no choice.
[name="Mudrock"]  If we have any demands, any convictions, anything to protect, we can only fight.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  There are other ways to solve problems.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Then... what of our fallen companions? If we stand peacefully, will the murderers open their homes and cities to us?
[name="Mudrock"]  They won't.
[name="Mudrock"]  We can only fight on... to help our fellow Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  'Our fellow Infected.'
[name="Folinic"]  Where are you going?
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Kazdel.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Folinic"]  Kazdel is not a good place.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2", name2="char_345_folnic_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mudrock"]  We're not good guys, Rhodes Island.
[name="Mudrock"]  Any real 'good place' is closed to us.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You have another choice, Mudrock.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  No. Not now.
[name="Mudrock"]  These Leithanians, these Sarkaz, they all have their own ideas.
[name="Mudrock"]  The resentment is still there. Nothing has made it easier to trust each other. Only the will to live as one ever held them all together. That was the only bond.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  How sad.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  No, Rhodes Island Swallow. Maybe we'll see each other again someday... to fight for the Infected.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=1)]
[name="GreyThroat"]  You're not the first one from Reunion to call me that.
[Character(name="char_367_swllow_1", name2="avg_npc_011#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mudrock"]  Is that so...
[name="Mudrock"]  After I leave here, we are, as before, enemies.
[name="Mudrock"]  Otherwise, Leithanien will suspect you. And you won't have an explanation.
[Character(name="avg_npc_011#2")]
[name="Mudrock"]  So... don't get too close to your enemy.
[name="Mudrock"]  I came only to offer a bouquet. And I did. So... it's time to go.
