[name="Ratatos"]You make that sound simple, but are you sure about this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_252")]
[name="Sharp"]I wouldn't say sure. But I can probably keep her busy for some ten minutes.

[name="Ratatos"]You're a monster yourself, huh...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_253_1#7$1")]

[name="Sciurus"]Why don't you take a look in the mirror before you say that crap, Ratatos?
[name="Sciurus"]You're exhausted, you look pale as a ghost. Hell, you look completely out of it.

[name="Ratatos"]You might just be right.
[name="Ratatos"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_253_1#1$1")]
[name="Ratatos"]Fine, Doctor of Rhodes Island. Sciurus will help you with your plan in my place.
[name="Ratatos"]Though, to tell you the truth, I'm not holding out hope that we can get anything back from Enciodes.
[name="Ratatos"]All I can say is: good luck.
