[character(name="avg_npc_267_1#1$1")]
[name="Chester"]There is no doubt that the expansion of the valleys and mines under Gnosis Edelweiss's management has brought the company tremendous profit.
[character(name="avg_npc_267_1#6$1")]

We no longer live in times where isolation is enough to keep ourselves out of the affairs around us.
In the past hundred years, there have been countless exchanges and conflicts between nations. Columbia rose quickly in a conflict, while Gaul, a powerful country, was also wiped out in a conflict.
All the world's nations are slowly changing in these times separated by Catastrophes. Refusing relations with others is no longer an option.
Kjerag cannot continue to lock itself away on these snowy mounts. Kjeragandr's protection—if Kjeragandr really exists in the first place—can bring the Snow Realm this far.
If we are to go any further, Kjerag must grow stronger than ever before.
The millennium of peace and quiet has reached its end, and we cannot wait for others to open the door for us.
Kjerag needs to make contact with the outside world. We must take that step forward while we still have control. That's the Silverash tradition.
Kjerag must remain Kjerag. We still have a chance, but time grows short for the snowy mountains.
I have seen our world... I have to make a difference. Everything I've witnessed needs to have meaning.

[name="Ensia"]Oripathy consultation... and the Grand Ceremony... Are those the only reasons my brother is inviting you to the Snow Realm?
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Ensia"]Oh, the Grand Ceremony takes place annually in Kjerag. It's the biggest ecent, and the most important thing to the Kjerag people.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#2$1")]
[name="Ensia"]On that day, everyone in Kjerag stops what they're doing and offers Kjeragandr, the goddess of our mountains, our most sincere prayers.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#2$1")]
[name="Ensia"]We pray for a happy, peaceful year under our mountain goddess's protection.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Ensia"]As for the Oripathy problem, Kjerag didn't have many Infected in the past, so most of us don't know much about Oripathy. In the Snow Realms, Oripathy is far from the greatest threat we face.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Ensia"]But ever since my brother got the mountains connected by railway, we've been getting more and more visitors, and life has also gotten much better. Thanks to that, everyone's starting to learn more about the Infected and Oripathy.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
[name="Ensia"]I guess Oripathy's stepping into the limelight since there are no other pressing issues.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]

[name="Ensia"]My parents died in an accident when I was still a kid...
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]And after they died, my brother, Enciodes, took over their business to support the family.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]He kept us afloat all by himself until I came of age. Then, to ensure our family's future, he left Kjerag to study in Victoria.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]Our family was already on pretty shaky ground before he left Kjerag, and that was around when he started getting more and more headstrong...

[name="Ensia"]But at least we all still got along well as siblings.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]

[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]Both my brother and sister treated me very well, but, for some reason, the two of them started talking less, and their relationship soured.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]Five years ago, when the last Saintess passed away, my sister joined the trials and became the new Kjerag Saintess.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]She's rarely left Mount Karlan since, and I haven't had a lot of chances to see her. We only write to each other now.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]And ever since she became the Saintess, it feels like my brother's often at odds with her...
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#7$1")]
[name="Ensia"]I may be very good at mountain climbing, but I wouldn't know where to start to mend relationships.
[character(name="avgnew_173_slchan_1#1$1")]
