[name="Neighbor"]Yeah. Just, it should've happened long ago, if you ask me. I don't hate his open door policy, seeing as our family made a good living from it too.

[name="Sharp"]Aurora, I need info to make judgment calls, especially your views as a local. Tell me how you see the Doctor's current situation.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]Gnosis was likely in a very sensitive position, given he was formerly in charge of the mines and valleys.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#2$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]Sir Enciodes putting the Doctor in that same position now is bound to draw Arctosz's attention.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]Tell me in detail about why the mines and valleys are such a sensitive area.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]Hmm... it'd be more convenient if we had a map on hand.

[name="Aurora"]Kjerag's topography isn't too complicated, and it's not very finely partitioned either.
[name="Aurora"]Usually, us locals just call each area the mines, valleys, woodlands, lakes, mountains, creeks, and plains.
[name="Aurora"]The creeks and plains, and most of the lakes, are the Paleroches' in the north.
[name="Aurora"]The Browntails in the west are mainly the woodlands, and the minority of the lakes.
[name="Aurora"]The Silverashes are mainly the mountains, valleys and mines. They have so little of the lakes, you can essentially ignore it.
[name="Aurora"]And the valleys and mines... actually, they represent nearly half of the Silverashes' territory already.
[name="Aurora"]Between them, the mines have always been incredibly important land to the Silverashes, because practically all the ore used in Kjerag comes from there.
[name="Aurora"]While the valleys were only developed in recent years.
[name="Aurora"]Originally, they were extremely poor land to work, and there weren't more than a few hamlets. People always considered it an area with no use.
[name="Aurora"]But after Sir Enciodes founded Karlan Trade, he chose that land to use for siting factories.
[name="Aurora"]The majority of Karlan Trade's manufacturing is built there, and it's extremely close to Mount Karlan, too.

[name="Aurora"]On top of that, I exchanged some info with Kjerag merchants before we left—but everyone who comes outside to do business is related to Karlan Trade in some way.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]A month ago, with the Great Saintess's backing, the Browntails and Paleroches requested and organized a team to investigate health and safety issues at the factories.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]But the team met a surprise attack secretly ordered by Gnosis, who wouldn't play along at all. I don't know how that info came out, but everyone believes Gnosis was involved in it.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]That led to the Paleroches' head, Arctosz, getting inspiration from the Vine-Bear Court to send troops to station in the valleys, and it's because of the consequences of Gnosis's extreme actions that he was finally removed.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]At the meeting, the Doctor mentioned Enciodes's reason for making the invitation.
[name="Sharp"]We do help construct Oripathy-related facilities for Karlan Trade, but he never mentioned having the Doctor manage anything in his place before.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]Which is to say, the Doctor's actively climbed onto the scales of this conspiracy. Very Doctor-like to do.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]That seems likely, but Karlan Trade and Rhodes Island have a perfectly fine relationship, and the Doctor would probably only accept because of that relationship.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]For now, I can't imagine the reason why Sir Enciodes would want to set up the Doctor...
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]What do we do now? Contact Dr. Kal'tsit?
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]The landship's headed for Victoria. We'd need the use of a local large-scale comms station, because our handheld equipment's got no way to get in touch.

[name="Aurora"]Captain...?
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]I surveyed for a stretch. Guard force at the Doctor's present placement is low-strength.
[name="Sharp"]The Paleroche residence should have about two hundred in guards, training and arms not up to outside army standard. We can break through on a surprise raid.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#2$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]I've checked surrounding terrain too. Alternate plan is we infiltrate, but that needs setting up explosives in multiple locations beforehand.
[name="Sharp"]Going in and pulling out both need manufactured explosions to draw attention. There're some points in the wall structure that'll let...
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#7$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]Wait! Captain!
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#7$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]Hm?
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]I feel like... things aren't going to get to that point.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]No matter what happens, we need to ensure the Doctor's safety. That's our first priority.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]...I agree with that, but...
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]If we bring force against the house of Paleroche in the run-up to the Grand Ceremony, then I'm worried Rhodes Island will end up an enemy of Mount Karlan.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]What will the Kjerag operators at Rhodes Island do?
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]I need to consider the worst-case scenario, and the least honorable way of solving things. The present outlook is pessimistic, and if I have to make a choice, you know I'll only choose the Doctor.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]We all hope things won't go that far, but you know as well as I that it doesn't depend on us, and I have a responsibility to the Doctor and Rhodes Island.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#4$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]I just can't shake the sense that... Sir Enciodes probably has his own plans.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]The Doctor chose to play them at their own game, so some kind of clue must've been there long ago, and the Doctor's already prepped to deal with it...
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]I've never doubted the Doctor's abilities for a moment. I believe.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]But I need to make my own preparations beforehand. The Doctor put me on standby, so there's a place for us in the plan.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]We need to get in touch with the Doctor first.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]Aurora.

[name="Sharp"]You respect Enciodes a lot.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#9$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]Yes... Without him, I would've never been able to leave Kjerag, and come into contact with the outside world.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]Understandable.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]But for the moment, I want you to forget that. Starting now, you treat him as a hypothetical enemy. Can you do that?
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#9$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]If you feel like you can't, you can head back right now. I won't blame you.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]But at the same time, I'm an employee of Rhodes Island too.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#5$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]Remember what you've just said.
[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Aurora"]Understood.

[character(name="avg_npc_252",name2="avg_422_aurora_1#4$1",focus=1)]
[name="Sharp"]I trust Cliffheart, but have no confidence in Ensia Silverash.
