Ratatos feels that she can understand the man's meaning, but the buzzing of those words inside her ears... is far too thunderous to bear.
The entire ceremony is awash with turmoil. She has never once felt the gaze of the surrounding people in such a way before - full of distrust and hostility, like barbs in her back.
Sciurus also seems to be saying something to her, and not in her usual sharp shouts, her lips are silently quivering.
Ratatos can tell from a glance what her voiceless words are. In the past, the two of them played similar tricks without the notice of adults.

Enya does not resist. She knows that right now, she does not have the leeway to resist.
From a certain point onward, she has known that this was all staged farce.
And the one who set this farce in motion... was her very own brother.
He ruthlessly shattered all the mental preparations she made for this moment, as well as her vision for the future.
Even if she could take down everyone standing in front of her right now, the people would still ask her to take the position that Enciodes prepared for her in the Vine-Bear Court.
She looks all around her.
When she sees Matterhorn take notice of her gaze, she deliberately looks away.
She sees the combatants clad in modern, cutting-edge equipment tearing through the formation of Silverash warriors, escorting Arctosz and Ratatos away.
She sees the eyes of the people focused on Enciodes, like a rapt audience in front of a theater's master.
She sees the hope and fervor in their eyes.
She sees Kjarr, and she sees the person standing next to her–you.
Your eyes meet, and within them, you see sorrow, reluctance, and–– fury.
All fleeting emotions.
She finally averts her eyes, and takes a step forward.

[name="Enciodes"]I must say, Rhodes Island's attack indeed surpassed my expectations. I did consider the possibility of them intervening, but underestimated their strength. This time, it is I whose plans have been forcefully disrupted.

[name="Enciodes"]There's no need. I still have a backup plan.
[name="Enciodes"]Moreover, whether or not those two die here has no bearing on what I'm going to do next.
[name="Enciodes"]Dr. {@nickname} must've realized as much, to make a decision like this.

[name="Degenbrecher"]Since you seem to hold this person in such high regard, then it isn't surprising to me that your Doctor would take advantage of this opportunity to manipulate the two clans into an obstacle for you.

[name="Enciodes"]It's just my intuition. My intuition as a chessmaster.
[name="Enciodes"]However, an outsider has rescued the heads of the Paleroche and Browntail clans...
[name="Enciodes"]Even I cannot fathom what one can achieve in this situation.
[name="Enciodes"]So, I am most curious as to what comes next.

The scene left behind by the turmoil has not yet been cleaned up, and the people are heatedly discussing what just took place.
But as Enciodes slowly makes his way to center stage, everyone stops what they are doing, and they all turn to look at him.
The crowd is waiting for him to pen the denouement to this farce.

[Character(name="avg_172_svrash_1#8$1")]
[name="Enciodes"]They are none other than Arctosz and Ratatos!
[name="Enciodes"]They were dissatisfied by the changes brought about by my proposal to relinquish our powers, and tried to assassinate me and poison the Great Elder to seize control of all Kjerag.
[name="Enciodes"]Without a doubt, there can be no greater blasphemy to Kjeragandr.
