[name="Sharp"]When I bummed around Karlan Trade, I heard a thing or two about his methods. Most of the staff there thinks he's got foresight.
[name="Sharp"]And now that he chose to stir the pot out in the open like that? You can tell it's his best option despite all the risks it comes with.

[name="Aurora"]I... I sure hope so.
[Character(name="avg_npc_252")]
[name="Sharp"]The Silverashes and the Browntails were on better terms in the past. Naturally, he's planted more than a few of his pawns who can help control the chaos.
[name="Sharp"]The problem is still the Paleroches. Their equipment and combat prowess may be behind the times, but their numbers are no joke.
[Character(name="avg_npc_250_1#6$1")]
[name="Kjarr"]Right, and the Silverashes have always been on pretty bad terms with them.
[name="Kjarr"]Besides, the Paleroches' men are all very loyal. It's hard to say they'll betray the Paleroche clan even with everything that has transpired.
[Character(name="avg_npc_252")]
[name="Sharp"]That's why I can understand why the Doctor decided to help the two of them.
[name="Sharp"]A family can only come together if the family head's still alive, and as long as we can influence the leaders in some way, the Doctor can still pull off some rough plan.
[name="Sharp"]Still though, Doctor, I guess I don't have to say it—
[name="Sharp"]Kjerag's got some complex terrain. It's not easy to get around here. We don't have much time.
