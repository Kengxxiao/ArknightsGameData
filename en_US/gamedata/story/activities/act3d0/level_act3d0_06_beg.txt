[name="Cronin"]    It's about time. As long as Schwarz and Rhodes Island can fight each other to a standstill, things will go smoothly here.
[name="Cronin"]    I knew pitting them against each other would be a masterful move. Heh.
[name="Cronin"]    Hurry up! Move these things out of here! Pick up the pace, or you won't be seeing your paychecks!
[name="Cronin"]    Hmm? What's that sound coming from outside?

[name="Ceylon"]   Doctor, if we just rush into the broadcast tower, I'm sure we'll run straight into Cronin's ambush.
[name="Ceylon"]   If we move together, Schwarz will definitely try to disarm your forces first, and I won't be able to contain her at all.
[name="Ceylon"]   Even if we seize the broadcast tower by force, without the support of the government, my words will only confuse the public and cause panic.
[name="Ceylon"]   If Schwarz is protecting Cronin, that will prove to be a major obstacle for you.
[name="Ceylon"]   Most importantly, you'll have to figure out a way to find out whatever Cronin is hiding.
[name="Ceylon"]   Maybe Cronin really is innocent, but...
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     In that case, we'd just force him to announce the news?
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Right. If that's what it boils down to, I don't mind using force, since I was thinking the same thing.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     That takes some guts, Miss Ceylon. Maybe even borders on reckless.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Rhodes Island has already proven my conclusion through their lab tests. If I don't do this, countless lives are going to be lost here.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     I'm not trying to blame you, Miss. I just don't get to decide whether Rhodes Island can go along with your plan.
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Do you mean...
[Character(name="char_188_helage_1",name2="char_348_ceylon_4#2",focus=1)]
[name="Hellagur"]     Doctor. You should be well aware of our options as well as their consequences. What should we do?

[name="Ceylon"]   Doctor...
[Decision(options="Do what you have to do.",values="1")]

[name="Ceylon"]   I understand. I'll hold Schwarz back.
[name="Ceylon"]   Besides, there's something I must do. I need to know the answer...

[name="Schwarz"]   ...
[name="Schwarz"]   Milady, you've received an education in Victoria. You belong somewhere better. Don't stay here and struggle with people like us.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...No. I don't agree with that.
[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz, what do you think I see you as? And what do you think of me as?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I am not the person you think I am, milady.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Because you've killed someone?

[name="Schwarz"]   No, milady. That's enough.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Perhaps we're both mistaken, Schwarz.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I don't want you to know about that, milady!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Sorry.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Milady?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I already know. I've already heard about your past... even if it's just a little bit of it.
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm sorry if you didn't want me to learn about it, but I can't just feign ignorance.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   No, milady! You're not supposed to know that! You should have...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I should have what? Kept doing what was expected of me? Kept studying hard, and then rise to the upper class? As if!
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm not some delicate flower, nor am I an ignorant little princess! I have something that I must do!
[name="Ceylon"]   All of us have a responsibility to protect Siesta. You and I, and my father as well! None of us are bystanders!
[name="Ceylon"]   You didn't want me to get involved in this in order to protect me, right?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   No, I...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   You're just like my father. Trying to dictate everything for me because it's 'for my own good,' but I don't think so!
[name="Ceylon"]   So what if what I'm doing is dangerous? So what if you have a dark past?! Maybe I'll cry or be terrified or even be hurt by these things...
[name="Ceylon"]   But if you ever say 'Ceylon, I need your help,' I'll always be there for you! No matter what you have to say, I'll always lend you my ear!
[name="Ceylon"]   If we really are friends, then we should do that for each other. How can we be considered friends when you're the only one doing the giving?!
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   So, Schwarz, would you help me right now?
[name="Ceylon"]   You asked me before why I'm doing this. And this is my answer...
[name="Ceylon"]   So, would you give me your response, Schwarz? If what happened in the past is truly in the past, could you be my friend again, just like before?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Milady... I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done and said. My actions have caused a misunderstanding between us that never should have happened...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Ah...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]

[name="Schwarz"]   Milady, please tell me, what are we going to do next?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Huh? I, um... I'd like to spread the news about the impending Catastrophe through official channels.
[name="Ceylon"]   Rhodes Island should be collecting evidence against Cronin as we speak, and he'll soon be kicked out of the City Council...
[name="Ceylon"]   However, after the news gets out, the Obsidian Festival will have to be canceled, and Siesta will have to move...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Don't worry, milady.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   R-really?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   If that's what you desire, then I will support you.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Milady, do you need me to protect you?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Mm, yes.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#6",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   In that case, please take cover. It'll be over soon.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Henchman"]   Schwarz, what are you doing? Are you disobeying Cronin's orders?
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#2")]
[name="Schwarz"]   Orders? Support Cronin? That's just a disguise. Since the very beginning, I've only had two orders.
[name="Schwarz"]   First, Master Doykos asked me to collect evidence against Cronin, including his secret manipulation of V3 Industries and his unauthorized harvesting of obsidian.
[name="Schwarz"]   Now that the truth has come to light, the gig is up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_020")]
[name="Cronin's Henchman"]   G-get them, quickly! Seize both of them, now!
[Character(name="char_340_shwaz_2#4")]
[name="Schwarz"]   As for the second order, you just heard it.
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Milady asked me to protect her.
