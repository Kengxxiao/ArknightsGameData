[name="Cronin"]   As things stand, you don't have any prestige left, Herman!
[name="Cronin"]   I've spent years training these people. Only they truly understand the wonderful life that comes from hard work!
[name="Cronin"]   Today is the climax of the festival. I'll take what has always rightfully belonged to me, and then bounce.
[name="Cronin"]   I bet you still have no idea what's going on.
[name="Cronin"]   Let me tell you out of mercy's sake. The data you got from the monitoring station is wrong. The volcano will very soon become active.
[name="Cronin"]   Originium will spread along with the eruption, and at least half of this city will be destroyed!
[name="Cronin"]   But I won't lose anything. I'll even come back after the eruption to mine the Originium!
[name="Cronin"]   Siesta is my paradise! I also deeply love this city, Herman!
[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Herman"]  How dare you!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Of course I dare, as the Catastrophe Messenger of this city.
[name="Cronin"]   But all you can do is witness your defeat, then the destruction of Siesta!
[name="Cronin"]   Of course, you will get the honor of dying to the eruption of the Siesta Volcano. Other than me, nobody else shall know about the secrets of this city.

[name="Herman"]   I'm disappointed in you, Cronin.
[Character(name="avg_npc_024",name2="avg_npc_023_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Cronin"]   Disappointed? You're the one who's disappointed? No, I'm disappointed in you!
[name="Cronin"]   I'll never forget the days when I lost my home, those sleepless nights in the dumpsters trying to take shelter from the elements!
[name="Cronin"]   Wealth is the key to a new life, and I've since come to understand that! But what about you? You wasted the money we worked so hard to earn on some Infected filth?!
[name="Cronin"]   Are you going to bury the infinite potential of Siesta beneath your hypocrisy?
[Character(name="avg_npc_024",name2="avg_npc_023_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Herman"]   Take a good look at yourself, Cronin.
[name="Herman"]   And take all the time in the world to reflect upon what you see, in prison!
