[name="Schwarz"]   ...Ceylon told me about the situation with the volcano.
[name="Schwarz"]   You tampered with the station's data and even accused Miss Ceylon of spreading false rumors.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Cronin"]   That's because we both know. We both know about what Herman did!

[name="???"]    Go on, Cronin. But make sure to also tell them what you did when I was 'out on business.' Tell them everything.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8")]
[name="Ceylon"]   F-Father...?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   What are you doing here?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Herman"]  Surprised to see me, Cronin?
[name="Herman"]  After I banned obsidian mining, there has still been a steady influx of fresh obsidian into the market.
[name="Herman"]  The mining team has been seen many times at the volcano's entrance, but nobody reported anything to me.
[name="Herman"]  The resources they mined would be transferred numerous times before finally arriving at the City Hall's abandoned warehouse.
[name="Herman"]  Despite the fact that I set aside funding to provide support for the various Oripathy patients who came to Siesta, I learned that they were actually suffering from discrimination throughout the city.
[name="Herman"]  Does this news surprise you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Tsk...
[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Herman"]  Well, hearing about it made my blood boil!
[name="Herman"]  In order to find out the truth, I pretended to leave the city and asked Schwarz to investigate for me.

[name="Hellagur"]  Looks like just investigating these records on the relevant personnel was enough.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8")]
[name="Ceylon"]   Mister Hellagur, you're all safe!
[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Herman"]  What a pity, Cronin.
[name="Herman"]  Originally, I was not opposed to sharing things with you, but you were too impatient.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Me? Impatient?
[name="Cronin"]   Everything I did was for the sake of this city! You were the one who taught me that!
[name="Cronin"]   What happened to the Baru family ten years ago, the collapse of the television station eight years ago, and the way you persuaded...
[name="Cronin"]   Or, should I say, 'annexed?' Yes, the way you annexed the Tarak Tribe. I know all about these things.
[name="Cronin"]   Everything I've done, I learned from you...
[name="Cronin"]   Exploit, and abandon. Use any means necessary. The ends justify the means.
[name="Cronin"]   Do you know all the sweat, blood, and tears I've poured into this shabby hole? And what did I get in return?
[name="Cronin"]   We worked so hard to mine the volcano and finally managed to improve our situation, but what did you do? You squandered it all to subsidize those incurable Infected!
[name="Cronin"]   If that's going to be the case, I'd prefer an eruption! All I need is to protect the true value of Siesta, and then I shall rise once again!
[Character(name="avg_npc_024")]
[name="Herman"]  True that I've done many things in the past. But never have I wagered the fate of Siesta.
[name="Herman"]  What do you think about the lives of the miners and researchers, about the lives of everyone living in this city?
[name="Herman"]  Cronin, you're fired.
[Character(name="avg_npc_023_2#2")]
[name="Cronin"]   Ahahahahaha! You senile fool, I wouldn't be so sure about that!
[name="Cronin"]   Thanks to your delusional prattling, my men have all assembled!

[name="Provence"]     Huh, never thought I'd see the day when you of all people would be stunned speechless.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]     My mind is racing. Give me a second to calm down.

[name="Provence"]     No, I'm not a geologist, nor do I know anything about Originium physics or high-energy Originium Arts, but...
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]     High-energy Arts has nothing to do with the ecology of a volcano. I doubt that stuff is going to fix our problem.
[name="Skyfire"]     If there's no other way, maybe I can create a giant vessel and transfer all the energy into it...
[name="Skyfire"]     But I'd need several years to draft Arts like that. Impossible, that's not gonna work at all.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]     I have no idea about any of that! But what I do know is, we're in serious trouble! Very serious trouble!
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]     Of course we are! Otherwise, why would I get excited?!

[name="Skyfire"]     What do you think I'm doing?!
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]     I need to let the Doctor know right away...
[name="Provence"]     So please think faster. I'll send the message right now! Also, don't let the heat short-circuit your brain!
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
