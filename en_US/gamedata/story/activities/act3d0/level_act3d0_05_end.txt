[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz, the years I spent studying in Victoria weren't just for show.
[name="Ceylon"]   There, I studied the most cutting-edge science and technology pertaining to Catastrophe and Originium research.
[name="Ceylon"]   Things that seem to fall within the realm of the divine to you, may well be a fact of reality for me.
[name="Ceylon"]   Everything that I've learned, as well as everything I believe in, tells me that I am right.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Milady, you did not go to law school.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Huh...?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   What is Rhodes Island trying to do at the City Hall?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Searching for evidence to use against Cronin.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Hmm?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Cronin may be slimy, but he's not stupid.
[name="Ceylon"]   He's a Catastrophe Messenger. There's no way he doesn't know about the volcano's situation.
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm sure he's hiding the truth for his own benefit, and as long as we can gather the evidence secretly...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I think Rhodes Island will confront him directly, so that whole secret search is unlikely to succeed.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#2",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...
[name="Ceylon"]   It-it's fine! Since you're not there...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Milady, I want to know why you're doing this. If you give me a reasonable answer, I won't go after Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   ...This is something I have to do. I don't believe that my father is such a cold-blooded person. He would never stand by idly and let this happen.
[name="Ceylon"]   My father loves this city more than anyone else. And I know that better than anyone else.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Do you still hate him?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#9",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Why would I? If anything, he should be the one who hates me, because my birth took my mother's life...
[name="Ceylon"]   But he never resented me.
[name="Ceylon"]   What I hate is how he arranges everything for me and never tells me what he's planning.
[name="Ceylon"]   It may seem like he's protecting me, but the end result is that I only end up ignorant and helpless.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#3",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Just like right now! It must be Cronin's fault; he must have hidden the truth about the eruption from my father.
[name="Ceylon"]   That's the only reason he ordered Cronin to stop me! Would you call that hate?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Eruption?
[name="Schwarz"]   What Cronin said was, you were going to reveal Master Doykos's secrets, so that he would be dismissed and put on trial.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   What?! No, what did my father even do in the past?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   Don't worry about it.
[name="Schwarz"]   ...Hmm, I see what is going on now.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   So Cronin wasn't even under my father's orders when he tried to capture me. Phew, that about clears things up.
[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz, if I really wanted to do something like that, I would have gone through legal channels.
[name="Ceylon"]   Everything that I'm doing is also for the sake of this city, my hometown.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#3",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   I understand. Milady, you're not concerned about the past, or about social standings.
[name="Schwarz"]   I feel the same way as you. As does your father.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Phew... No matter what others think, I'll always trust you and my father.
[name="Ceylon"]   Even if there's a conflict between our goals, I trust that we'll be able to resolve things between the two of us.
[name="Ceylon"]   That's why I believed that you'd be here. We both understand this city well.
[name="Ceylon"]   That's why you'd come to stop me.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Come to think of it, it doesn't really matter who the mayor is, right? I'm sure that's what my father would think. What he cares about is this city.
[name="Ceylon"]   That's why I know he'll agree with me.
[name="Ceylon"]   Schwarz... wouldn't you agree?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4",name2="char_340_shwaz_2#5",focus=2)]
[name="Schwarz"]   You've grown, milady.
