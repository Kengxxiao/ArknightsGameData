[name="Emperor"]   You mean an attempted shooting, assassination, kidnapping, suicide threat, or something along those lines?
[name="Emperor"]   Do you think those things can stop me? Me?
[name="Emperor"]   No, those things shall only become a part of my show, just like how rhythm breaks apart the meaning of words. Do you understand?

[Character(name="char_105_emper")]

[name="Emperor"]   You think I'd forget who you are just because you decided to roll around in the sewers? Will pointing your weapon at these youngsters satisfy you, 'Songster?'
