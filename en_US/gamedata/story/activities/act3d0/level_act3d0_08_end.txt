[name="Ceylon"]   Is it really getting weaker? I can't tell from the appearance at all!
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3")]
[name="Skyfire"]   Watch out for the lava! Just how much obsidian has this thing absorbed?!
[Character]
[name="Giant Originium Slug"]   GROOOAAAAARRRRR!!!
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   Poor thing... But we can't afford to show it any mercy! Skyfire!

[name="Skyfire"]   All right, I got it! Time to go all out!
[name="Skyfire"]   Well then, how do you like the taste of this?!

[name="Provence"]  I finally managed to land a hit through a crack in the lava, but I can't guarantee that it's going to work on something of this size!

[name="Skyfire"]   Good grief! I can't believe a single slug would be that hard to deal with! My skirt is all ruined...

[name="Provence"]   It was the leader of the colony after all.
[name="Provence"]   If people didn't destroy their habitat in the first place, then perhaps...

[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]   That's understandable, but a mature lady should also learn to get help if she's not even able to keep her balance.

[name="Ceylon"]   Th-thank you...

[name="Skyfire"]  All right, let's go take our victory lap now. Once we get back, there might still be some time for us to enjoy our vacation.

[name="Provence"]   Skyfire...
[Character(name="char_166_skfire_3#2",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Skyfire"]    I know.
[name="Skyfire"]    But we should respect the city's choice, and let them handle the rest, right?
