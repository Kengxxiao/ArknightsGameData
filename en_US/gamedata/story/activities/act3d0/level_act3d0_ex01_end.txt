AaaaAAAaaaaAHH~♪
[name="Manager"]   Get up already!
[name="D.D.D."]   Urgh... Gah!
[name="D.D.D."]   M-Man... things got gnarly last night! Gimme a few more minutes...

[name="D.D.D."]   Phew, nothing like a cold shower to start the day! I have a feeling that it's gonna be a great day!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   Drink the vegetable juice. I told room service to put it in the fridge.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#5")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Those aren't even fit for consumption!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#5", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   Don't act like I don't know. You screamed for like two whole minutes during last night's show, right?
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#3")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Y-yeah.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#3", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   Even though you're not a singer, you need to take better care of your throat. But last night's performance was a huge success. Congratulations.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#6")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Hmm, I don't know about that.
[name="D.D.D."]   I've tried, but no matter how much effort I put into it, I feel like I won't ever be able to do better than D.litHun.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#6", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   You've already done very well.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Is that so? Well... It's no big deal. I've made up my mind. For the next collab album, I want to make four more remixes for our demo so our partners can have more tracks to choose from.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   Four more demos?! You've already made 26 mixes the last few days. I know you see it as practice, but you can't push yourself like that!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2")]
[name="D.D.D."]   It's fine. I had some new ideas during the show last night. I want to try taking them in some new directions.
[name="D.D.D."]   I've just about figured out my limits. Now that I have a better understanding, I'll just have to keep pushing my limits further. That's what improvement is.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   But what about the concerts? Your schedule is full until next year!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Not a problem! I have whole 'nother stamina bar for that!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   I don't even know what you're talking about now!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Oh come on, we've worked with each other for so long. Do I ever make mistakes?
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   You blew out all the lights in the studio last time!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1")]
[name="D.D.D."]   That was a problem with Arts, not with the music!
[name="D.D.D."]   But, you did just remind me of something.
[name="D.D.D."]   If that theory is correct, my ideas and my musicality... can definitely be taken to another level.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   ...The relationship between Originium Arts and music is still just a hypothesis. Don't let that lead you around by the nose.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#3")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Huh? Do I even have a nose?
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#3", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   You should have figured that out long ago without needing to ask me!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2")]
[name="D.D.D."]   But, the Leithanians did it.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   ...
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Notes, melodies, form, structure. Everything is composed the same way one would write Originium Arts.
[name="D.D.D."]   Gaaah! It's just too profound! It doesn't feel like the way I'd do things!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#2", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   If you've already realized that, then I can rest easy.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#3")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Perhaps I do need to kick back and relax a bit.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#3", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   Good, don't push yourself too hard.
[name="Manager"]   But wait, don't cause another blackout in the district again!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#5")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Jeez, I won't! I'll keep things under control this time.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#6")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Oh, that reminds me, I met that Cronin person you were talking about.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#6", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   What'd you think about him?
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#6")]
[name="D.D.D."]   To be honest... I don't think he'd be a very good sponsor. He seemed like the kind of person who cares too much about money.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#6", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   I had the same feeling the last time I saw the contract... But it's fine, Siren gets to decide our sponsors anyway. I know you're a good judge of character.
[name="Manager"]   Be careful out there. Some say that Siesta is a lot more complicated than it looks. Also, don't use that Grace account for now.
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Don't worry. I said I'd keep things under control. This is my greatest secret after all!
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1", focus=-1)]
[name="Manager"]   Your little underground organization, huh?
[Character(name="avg_NPC_017_3#1")]
[name="D.D.D."]   Musicians always need their own space!
