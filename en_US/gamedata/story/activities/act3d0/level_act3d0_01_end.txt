[name="Provence"]   Yeah, that's how we met Ceylon in the forest at the base of the volcano.

[name="Ceylon"]   I have a question.
[name="Ceylon"]   Did you really have to give an entire dissertation on how you saved me?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_166_skfire_3#1",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   I'm with the lassie here. Plus, did I hear you say something about how you found me annoying?
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   Ah, um, you must have heard me wrong!

[name="Ceylon"]   Umm, well, even though it's rather late for this, allow me to introduce myself.
[name="Ceylon"]   My name is Ceylon Doykos, and I'm a graduate of Victoria National University as well an Originium researcher. I'm also the daughter of this city's mayor.

[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Who would've expected the mayor's daughter to be wandering around alone on the volcano?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#4")]
[name="Ceylon"]    Well, academic curiosity necessarily comes with its share of dangers...
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   Let's continue talking about that volcano...

[name="Ceylon"]   A-ahem.
[name="Ceylon"]   Thank you very much, strangers.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]   Don't mention it.
[name="Provence"]   But, what brings you here alone?
[name="Provence"]   Isn't this a bit too far for a long walk on the beach?
[name="Provence"]   Hmm, judging by the tools you have on you...
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Provence, she's here to investigate, just like us.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Huh, is that so?
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#3",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   She has a notebook with her, but she's also dressed to the nines.
[name="Skyfire"]   Assuming she's not just a simpleton, then that means...
[name="Skyfire"]   She had a flash of inspiration and rushed out of the house without even bothering to change, and then ran into trouble while still dressed like this.
[name="Skyfire"]   I can't begin to tell you how many dresses I've gotten burnt this way.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#3",focus=1)]
[name="Provence"]   Uhh, don't you think that's just a little abnormal?
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2")]
[name="Ceylon"]   Well, setting aside the thing with the dresses, you've pretty much got the gist of it.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   I do have to say, it's rather dangerous to do that... especially if you're not prepared.
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#3",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   Don't worry. As long as I'm here, you could even come empty-handed and still be fine.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Anyways, thanks for saving me.
[name="Ceylon"]   Come find me after I get back to town, and I'll be sure to repay you.
[name="Ceylon"]   However, I have something important to do right now, so pardon me for my rudeness.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#5",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]   Oh, if you're still busy, then sorry for interrupting. However, it's best not to go to the volcano alone.
[name="Provence"]   You should know how dangerous it is by yourself since you got attacked by these Originium slugs.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]。
[name="Ceylon"]   Well, that was just an accident. I was in a a hurry, so I wasn't paying attention to my surroundings.
[name="Ceylon"]   I grew up in this city. If the Originium slugs really are that dangerous, the mayor would've done something about it.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#2",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=2)]
[name="Provence"]   ...Hmm, all right. However, if you ask me, I'd say they gathered here for a reason.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Nothing's different about this place, so why would...
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Wait, agitation due to changes in the environment.... So that's what's going on! Thank you, I have another line of evidence!
[Character(name="char_145_prove_1",name2="char_166_skfire_3#2",focus=2)]
[name="Skyfire"]   ...Provence, by the looks of things, she reached the same conclusion as you.
[name="Skyfire"]   Even though I'm not an expert on volcanoes, I do have a degree of understanding as a professional and comprehensive scholar.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#8")]
[name="Ceylon"]   Could you two also be here to look for proof?
[name="Ceylon"]   Proof that the volcano is going to erupt?

[Character(name="char_145_prove_1")]
[name="Provence"]   An unusual and irritating odor, a higher temperature than normal, and aggressive Originium slugs...
[name="Provence"]   Also, based on the presence of these infected creatures, this may be no ordinary volcano. The mining companies would go crazy if they found out that there might be Originium in this volcano.
[Character(name="char_348_ceylon_4#7",name2="char_145_prove_1",focus=1)]
[name="Ceylon"]   Not many people know about the actual conditions of the volcano, and information about it is controlled by the City Council's relevant departments.
[name="Ceylon"]   Agitation due to environmental changes... At least that gives me something to work with.
[name="Ceylon"]   I've been looking for experts in this field to help ensure the safety of the city and its residents.
[name="Ceylon"]   Please help me, and the city of Siesta, make it through these dangerous times.
