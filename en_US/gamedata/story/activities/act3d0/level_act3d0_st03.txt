[name="Ceylon"]   Doctor, did you know? When I was a child, this beach wasn't this busy. I used to like making sand castles by myself.
[name="Ceylon"]   ...This city is getting better and better every year, thanks to my father.
[name="Ceylon"]   My father and I, well, don't talk a lot.
[name="Ceylon"]   I've always wondered... Which is more important, this city and the wealth it brings, or me?
[name="Ceylon"]   My mother died when she gave birth to me. Sometimes I think about if that's the reason why he doesn't like me.
[name="Ceylon"]   And it feels like he doesn't care if I like him or not. Ever since I can remember, he has rarely been at home because of business. Rather than father and daughter, we're more like two strangers living under the same roof.

[name="Ceylon"]   If I remember properly, he's the grandson of the owner of the Mockingbird Café on Second Avenue.
[name="Ceylon"]   I used to go there a lot. The old storekeeper was a kind man. His wife had already passed away at that time, so he decorated the café with her favorite flowers and bonsai trees, and put on their favorite music.
[name="Ceylon"]   But he did say that he was getting too old to run the shop, and would pass the business over to his grandson.
[name="Ceylon"]   Time sure flies.

[name="Ceylon"]   The reason I became an Originium researcher was because of her. I wanted to cure her.
[name="Ceylon"]   That has always been the thing motivating me. I even went to Victoria to pursue this dream.
[name="Ceylon"]   However, Originium research is very difficult. At the beginning, I couldn't even grasp the basic concepts and felt like giving up. But I persevered.
[name="Ceylon"]   Victoria is also very far away, and I couldn't get used to it at first.

[name="Ceylon"]   When the major concert begins, everyone's going to be gathered by the stage. Cronin's men are going to be have their hands full trying to keep things orderly.
[name="Ceylon"]   As long as we control the tower at that time, we can spread the news throughout the whole city.
[name="Ceylon"]   So, I'm asking both of you, please lend me your aid!
