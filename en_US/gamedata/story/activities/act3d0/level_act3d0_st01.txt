[name="???"]   The sample data from the volcano monitoring station has been retrieved. Please look over it.
[name="Woman's Voice"]   Just tell me the results.
[Image(image="ac3_report",screenadapt="coverall",x=0, y=0, xScale=1, yScale=1, fadetime=4)]
[name="???"]   Those people over there said that the sample's temperature has not yet exceeded the highest on record for this year.
[name="???"]   It's also not quite at the levels of the peaks from the past three years. The state of steam emissions is normal as well.
[name="???"]   So...
[name="Woman's Voice"]   So?
[name="???"]   So, the station concludes that nothing abnormal will happen with the volcano, and your request for announcement has been denied once again. The mayor also...

[name="Woman's Voice"]   You've got to be kidding me!!
[name="Woman's Voice"]   Although my methods may be a bit simple, I'm sure that there's something amiss about this sample here.
[name="Woman's Voice"]   The volcano was already in a precarious state last year!
[name="Woman's Voice"]   But they didn't even send a warning or make a news report! Nothing at all!!
[name="???"]   Miss Ceylon, p-please calm down.
[name="???"]   If the monitoring station says that there's no abnormality, nobody will trust us no matter what we do.
[Image(fadetime=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   I'm sorry...
[name="Ceylon"]   Can we really rely on the monitoring station's data?
[name="???"]   To be honest, Siesta's City Council doesn't pay much attention to this. Perhaps something is wrong with the detector.
[name="Ceylon"]   That would mean that the fact that the volcano has become abnormal is being covered up.
[name="???"]   So, what are you going to do next?
[name="Ceylon"]   I can't explain the current phenomenon based upon what I know. If we can't get an accurate report from those in charge, we'll have to turn to an outside organization.
[stopmusic(fadetime=2)]
[name="Ceylon"]   So far, things are stable here and we still have time. Would we be able to find some professionals among the tourists here if we took the time?
[name="Ceylon"]   Even though we can't expect to find the right people, nor can we expect them to reach the correct conclusion, this is our last chance...
[name="Ceylon"]   The tourists have already begun to pour into Siesta.
[name="Ceylon"]   After all, the Obsidian Festival is about to begin. If we don't act now, it'll soon be too late.

[name="Cronin"]   Welcome to Siesta City, my friends.
[name="Cronin"]   Siesta is home to lush mountains and clear waters, sunny skies and refreshing breezes, and the most passionate people in the world.
[name="Cronin"]   Due to the rare and perfect natural environment that we've been gifted, Siesta is committed to becoming the best tourist hotspot and bringing you an unforgettable summer getaway.
[name="Broadcast"]    On this subject, let's talk about the Siesta Volcano. Many tourists who are unfamiliar with volcanoes may have questions about this. Care to explain it to our listeners?
[name="Cronin"]   Gladly. First, there's nothing to be worried about. Unlike what some people may think, the Siesta Volcano is our friend, not something filled with mysteries and dangers.
[name="Cronin"]   I can guarantee this as a Catastrophe Messenger, so please rest assured.
[name="Cronin"]   As you may already know, Siesta's development owes greatly to the Siesta Volcano.
[name="Cronin"]   Some of you may remember the Catastrophe that almost hit Siesta a number of years back. But because of the volcano's protection, Siesta was totally unaffected.
[name="Broadcast"]    Speaking of which, Siesta has another special feature - obsidian. 
[name="Broadcast"]    Obsidian is believed to have the ability to suppress Oripathy, so it has become increasingly popular in recent years.
[name="Cronin"]   That's right. The small number of Infected in Siesta is the best proof of that.
[name="Cronin"]   You may have heard rumors or even scientific 'theories' from outside, but the reality within Siesta is the best evidence.
[name="Cronin"]   Unfortunately, obsidian mining has been banned by the government in order to protect the volcano's habitat.
[name="Cronin"]   Nevertheless, the trade of existing obsidian products is legal, so if you're interested in these products, please head over to the market.

[name="Male Tourist A"]   Hey, did you hear that? There was another fight at First Avenue last night.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="avg_npc_021",focus=1)]
[name="Male Tourist B"]   No, I live on Fifth. I reckon it was another fight between fans?
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="avg_npc_021",focus=2)]
[name="Male Tourist A"]   Yeah. Jeez, talk about crazy. The way those guys were going at it, you'd think they killed the other guy's parents or something.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="avg_npc_021",focus=1)]
[name="Male Tourist B"]   Peace is best, after all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="avg_npc_021",focus=2)]
[name="Male Tourist A"]   ...So, why don't you take off that outfit of yours already? ！
[name="Male Tourist A"]   It's not every day we get to go on vacation, so why are you all wrapped up like that?

[name="Female Tourist C"]   Give me a break, just go by yourselves then. I can barely feel my feet from following you guys the last three nights...
