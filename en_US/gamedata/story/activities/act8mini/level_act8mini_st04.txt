[name="Theresa"]Don't worry, I'm just a bit nervous. After all, you've known the Doctor for longer than you've known me, and I would like to leave a good first impression.
[name="Theresa"]There's just one thing though. Kal'tsit, you have some concerns about the kind of person the 'Doctor' is now, right? It's written all over your face.
[name="Theresa"]Let me find out as well, Kal'tsit. I'm really curious, what sort of person is that 'Doctor' who is so closely connected to your past?
[name="Theresa"]How should I go about it...? Meeting this Doctor, exchanging pleasantries, connecting the Doctor to myself and the Sarkaz... These are all questions I have to answer for myself.
[name="Theresa"]My opinion... can influence you as well, yes?
[name="Theresa"]So, Kal'tsit, take me to see the Doctor, won't you?

[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes, but the results aren't exactly a cause for celebration.

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Huh? Oh... I suppose it is.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]No, I meant to say, you're a lot earlier than usual.
[name="Kal'tsit"]It's hard to imagine that the people in the Chairman's office would just let you go that easily, unless the result is so bad that there's nothing to talk about.
[name="Kal'tsit"]Even if that is the case, you... still did come a bit too early.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"] I guess so... but we anticipated this current situation... a long time ago, didn't we?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]What happened?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]The Military Council has gained support, and our information channels throughout Kazdel are shrinking.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Babel will likely come under siege in the fall.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Some of the Sarkaz betrayed us, which is to be expected.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]

[character(name="avg_npc_056")]

[name="Kal'tsit"]The King of the Nachzehrer and the rest of the royal court...
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]They've only put forth a more demanding request. Don't worry, Kal'tsit, they're just targeting me.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]

[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Theresa.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]What is it, Doctor? Ah... Right, I haven't formally solicited your advice yet, and it would be unbecoming of me to start giving orders rashly.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Doctor, it seems we'll need to get a bit further away from Kazdel. This calls for a full relocation, or in other words, a retreat.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Do you have a second opinion?
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]This might be the only option.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]If possible... I would have liked to give everyone more options. But we're out of time.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]The Military Council's ideas are both too heavy-handed and direct, and I stood firmly opposed to their ideology. But to prevent Kazdel from making unnecessary sacrifices, we'll have to leave, temporarily.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]I believe— I truly believe, that we share the same heart, and the same blood flows through us. But even blood can be separated and transfused, and I don't know when we'll be able to merge again.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]At least for now, separating is the least damaging option.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Every Sarkaz has a desire to follow her beliefs. I can feel your convictions, and there will be many Sarkaz following you.
[name="Doctor"]But I will not help you make a decision. I can only bear witness.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#3")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes. That's the best arrangement in front of us so far, Dr. {@nickname}.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Alright then, without further ado, the two of you should pack up and get ready to set out!
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]How much can we take with us?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Unfortunately, not much. We may have to abandon a large number of our facilities. Ascalon will buy us time.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]That's more than enough, Theresa. You don't need to dispatch any more hands to help us. I'll bring the Doctor back to rendezvous with you safely.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Then we'll follow the pre-arranged plan, Kal'tsit. The person-in-charge will arrive later.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]But, Doctor, Kal'tsit, I'm sorry to make you evacuate in such a hurry.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]We'll have to put the research on hold for the time being... How I hoped to see the fruits that they would bear.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]I'll work hard to create a space where we can continue our research. Finally...
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]I believe things will take a turn for the better.

[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]Damned outsider! How dare you call Her Majesty by name...!
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Do you hate Kal'tsit...? Do you hate the Doctor?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Just because they are not Sarkaz? Not because of what they've done, or what they will do?
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]Yes, that's exactly right, Your Majesty!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]There are so many excellent people around you, so why do you insist on letting these outsiders—
[Character(name="avg_npc_026")]
[name="Scout"]Shut your mouth!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]......!
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes... I understand what you mean.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Allow me to ask one more question. Scout, what's your verdict?
[Character(name="avg_npc_026")]
[name="Scout"]I respect your judgment, but per my opinion, he should be taken into custody immediately and locked up.
[Character(name="avg_npc_026")]
[name="Scout"]According to military law, there can be only one outcome.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Indeed, this is but one choice. We are always faced with countless choices.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]No matter what schemes or designs he may have, he will be unable to resist that desire.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]This won't be the last time you see actions like this.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa, if your tolerance creates further troubles, it will eventually threaten your safety.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]He simply made an unfortunate decision.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]No, Your Majesty...! P-Please, I can explain...
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]I am... Sarkaz... a Sarkaz of Kazdel...! I just couldn't bear the thought... of you and Babel being so far away from Kazdel!
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]......
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Initially, this was the thing I resisted the most. Underhanded tactics and tricks... If this was not the only way to achieve a lasting peace, I would not be able to swallow this pill.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]But the Sarkaz have been waiting for too long.
[name="Theresa"]Among the countless wars, we must utilize this war, along with equally innumerable lives, to open up this world and understand its emotions.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Kal'tsit, Doctor, this will be the attitude I have towards you. We share the same beliefs, and we can complement each other. Therefore, I choose to respect the Doctor's choice.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Doctor, please tell me how you'd like this to end.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]This Sarkaz... He carried out an act of betrayal, not against me, but against an image of Theresa in his heart that had disappointed him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]He cannot be called a traitor. As far as I can see, Her Majesty Theresa is willing to grant freedom to so many people—
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]—Why not exile this Sarkaz, and see what choices he makes?
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]Let him fend for himself upon this land.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]He may find a new faith, maybe in you, or someone else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]—You... Why are you doing this...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]I'm opposed.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Even if the existing evidence does not prove his involvement with the Military Council, I do not deem it prudent to release a soldier who openly attacked his commander.
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1#2")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]Theresa.
[Character(name="avg_npc_048")]
[name="Doctor"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]Y-Your Majesty...
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Leave it to the army.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Yes, Marco, you are... a Sarkaz mercenary.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]So, Scout, take him to see Ascalon.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]Babel will decide your fate. Ascalon will decide your fate.
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]That you consider yourself a Sarkaz of Kazdel means you cannot leave.
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]—Your Majesty! You, you're putting me to death—?
[character(name="avg_npc_056")]
[name="Theresa"]......

[name="Kal'tsit"]Scout, before he has any outbursts of emotion, restrain—

[name="Theresa"]......
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]I was wrong... I was wrong. Your Majesty, you still have what we long for, the story we've heard for decades!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]The banner of the six heroes still flies. How many have grown up listening to the tales of you leading the Sarkaz against foreign invaders? The masses wait for that era to come again!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
[name="Sarkaz Traitor"]I've been waiting— We've all been waiting!
[Character(name="avg_npc_054")]
