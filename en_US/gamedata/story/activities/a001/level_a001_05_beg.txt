[name="Grani"]   So, this really is the only entrance to the cave, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Mhm. It's like a maze inside the cave, but the village elders have brought me here several times before, including when I succeeded the previous chief...
[name="Carol"]   ...Um, I might just be imagining things, but don't you think the shouts from inside the forest are getting louder...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Things are only going to get worse if we run into any more delays.
[name="Grani"]   Carol, you know your way around inside the cave, right? I'd like you to go inside and retrieve the treasure right now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Huh? What about you...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   I'll stay at the entrance.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   No way!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Huh? Carol...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#4",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   You're going to face the bounty hunters alone? That's too dangerous! You'll be...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   If I can't help you secure that treasure, I'd be letting down the entire village, and you as well.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   ...But, I don't want to lose you.
[name="Carol"]   This... isn't the time or place for you to be playing hero...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   What's wrong with playing the hero?
[name="Grani"]   'Even with their hearts impaled by the enemy's blades, the King's knights still held on to their spears.'
[name="Grani"]   I refuse to run away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Grani...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Besides, Carol, this isn't just my battle.
[name="Grani"]   It's also your battle. Perhaps you will run into dangers along the way, but as long as we can restore peace to this land...
[name="Grani"]   We must face our duties head-on.
[name="Grani"]   I trust that you'll find the treasure.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   But... if I'm alone...
[name="Carol"]   The treasure...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Trust me.
[name="Grani"]   No matter what, I'll protect you. Back when I rescued you, I promised that nobody would ever hurt you again.
[name="Grani"]   Not even a single strand of hair on your head.
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#5",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Even though you're just a kid...
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   I'm no such thing... I'm just vertically challenged!
[Character(name="avg_npc_003",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=1)]
[name="Carol"]   Haha!
[name="Carol"]   ...Mm, I'll do as you said, Grani.
