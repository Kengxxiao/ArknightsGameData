[name="Big Bob"]   This rock...
[name="Big Bob"]   Stay close to me, you two. Watch your step, and stay inside my footprints. Don't go around touching things either.
[name="Big Bob"]   I'm afraid this forest is even more dangerous than we suspected.
[Character(name="char_220_grani#3")]
[name="Grani"]   Is something carved on that rock?
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=1)]
[name="Big Bob"]   These are marks left behind by bounty hunters. We need to take heed of these, or we may well end up stepping in a trap.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="char_220_grani#3",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   So, how are we going to avoid the traps?
[Character(name="avg_npc_010")]
[name="Big Bob"]   Just watch me.
[name="Big Bob"]   An animal trap on a rope... how old-fashioned.

[name="Big Bob"]   Here's a rolling log trap, hidden by the foliage. Would've tripped it if we rushed forward.
[name="Big Bob"]   Miss Carol, watch your step.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="avg_npc_003",focus=2)]
[name="Carol"]   Uh, huh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="avg_npc_003",focus=1)]
[name="Big Bob"]   If you take another step in that direction, there's probably a spiked pitfall waiting for you.

[name="Carol"]   Oh...!
[Character(name="char_220_grani#3")]
[name="Grani"]   You sure are the real deal. You're pretty good at this.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010")]
[name="Big Bob"]   Of course. After all, I used to...
[name="Big Bob"]   ...
[name="Big Bob"]   It's not realistic to go around all the traps. Looks like we'll have to disarm some of them after all.
[name="Big Bob"]   The most perilous path for them will soon become the safest path for us.
[name="Big Bob"]   Let's go.

[name="Big Bob"]   Something's not right here.
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=2)]
[name="Grani"]   Is it a trap?
[Character(name="avg_npc_010",name2="char_220_grani#1",focus=1)]
[name="Big Bob"]   No...
[name="Big Bob"]   A symbol drawn with blood...
[name="Big Bob"]   '...Monster?'
[name="Big Bob"]   What's the meaning of this? In all my years, I've never seen a symbol like this.

[Character(name="avg_npc_010")]
[name="Big Bob"]   Grani, something's not right about her eyes.
