[name="Anthony"]On July 24th six years ago, I was heading to a dinner party when, all of a sudden, a bodyguard told me something had happened back home and my father told me to run.
[name="Anthony"]I had no idea what had happened. I didn't even had the chance to say goodbye to my parents before I went on the run.
[name="Anthony"]I was arrested when I made it to Ironforge.
[name="Anthony"]I thought that was all there was to it, but it didn't take long after I was put in prison for me to find out that wasn't the case.
[name="Anthony"]The way I'm treated here is not how criminals are usually treated. I realized right away that my father probably arranged for my imprisonment.
