[name="Silence"]So my preliminary judgment is that you are most likely my 'competitor' as far as this incident goes.
[name="Silence"]You want Anthony as well.
[name="Silence"]And the thing that puzzles me the most is what Saria was doing there.
[name="Silence"]She's completely cut ties with Rhine Lab. She's a Rhodes Island operator right now.
[name="Silence"]The way I see it, she had no reason to get involved.

[name="Silence"]No, and I really didn't understand why until just now either. Kafka certainly didn't stand a chance against her, so in theory she should've been the true victor of this whole incident.

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]Let's call it a rescue. By rescuing Anthony, she became the ultimate victor.
[name="Silence"]She thinks the best place for Anthony to be isn't where you are. That would only help grow your influence, so she probably chose to take matters into her own hands.
[name="Silence"]I don't know what it is that she's doing, and I don't want to know, but she definitely knows that HydeBro won't let this slide, nor will you, now that she has betrayed you.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]So that's why she didn't show up until the very end. She wanted to hide the fact she was ever involved in this whole incident.

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]And my guess is Jesselton was put in jail after that; they probably figured out right afterwards that he wasn't a real prison guard. That's why I don't have much information about him.
[name="Muelsyse"]I really got thrown for a loop by Saria this time, though. I mean, I knew she wasn't going to hand him over to me right from the start, but still...
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]I didn't have a choice.
[name="Muelsyse"]There wasn't anyone in the company trustworthy and capable enough.
[name="Muelsyse"]If there was anyone else I could've turned to, I wouldn't have bothered asking her.

[name="Muelsyse"]I may be Ecological's director, but I'm not actually all that powerful.

[name="Muelsyse"]Relax. That was my plan in the beginning, but I've had a little change of heart.

[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#1",focus=1)]
[name="Silence"]That's right. I did that not as a member of Rhodes Island, but as an individual. I... I lied to them.

[name="Muelsyse"]Well, you're not a good liar, Ms. Silence.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4", name2="char_249_muesys_1#5",focus=2)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Anyway, I get the gist of it now.
[name="Muelsyse"]Your goal is probably to make Anthony a Rhodes Island operator or, at the very least, put him under the company's protection. That's the best course of action in your opinion.
[name="Muelsyse"]And well, setting aside the question of whether Anthony would willingly subject himself to Saria's grumpiness, Saria probably wanted to keep Anthony on her leash.
[name="Muelsyse"]But even if Anthony's okay with it, Saria probably thinks he's nothing but trouble.
[name="Muelsyse"]That's why she chose to have him join you guys at Rhodes Island. It's a pretty good choice.
[name="Muelsyse"]Actually, she probably thinks that it's all good enough for her as long as Anthony makes it out of the prison alive and things don't go either my way or Ferdinand's.
[name="Muelsyse"]As for what Anthony wants to do and what he can do once out of prison, that doesn't matter to her one bit.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Is that so?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer#2",focus=1)]
[name="Muelsyse"]That's right. It's hard for me to imagine Saria caring about others. Actually, it felt pretty strange to me when she agreed to help me out.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]But why is she okay with him joining Rhodes Island? Things could get out of hand with him at Rhodes Island too.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Probably because it keeps this whole prison affair relatively low key. If someone really looked into this mess, it would put HydeBro in the limelight, and those guys would do whatever it takes to cover all this up.
[name="Muelsyse"]And even though Rhodes Island and Rhine Lab work together, as long as all this is kept under wraps, there's going to be a lot of room to turn things around.
[name="Muelsyse"]In other words, if Anthony becomes a Rhodes Island operator, he'll actually be pretty safe for the time being.
[name="Muelsyse"]I don't really know much about Saria's work relationship with Rhodes Island, but I know a thing or two about this company.
[name="Muelsyse"]I think if I were Rhodes Island's leader, I wouldn't mind taking in Anthony at all.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5", name2="char_242_mayer#1",focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Eh, I'm so lost...
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1", name2="char_242_mayer#1", focus=1)]
[name="Muelsyse"]Well, to put it simply, Saria snatched away something I was hoping she would give me.
[name="Muelsyse"]But she didn't keep it for herself. She pawned it to a pretty well-guarded shop.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1", name2="char_242_mayer#4", focus=2)]
[name="Mayer"]Oh, that's much easier to understand. But... what about it?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]So you want me, an employee of the pawn shop, to talk the owner into selling the item in question to you?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Bingo~
[name="Muelsyse"]If Saria decided to keep Anthony around, I guess there wasn't anything I could've done about it for the time being.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]But since she chose to turn him over to Rhodes Island, there's still room for me to intervene.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Don't worry, I'm not asking you to do this all by yourself.
[name="Muelsyse"]If Saria, the former Defense Director, was able to form a partnership with Rhodes Island, then I'm sure they'll be willing to work with me, the Ecological Director, too.
[name="Muelsyse"]I'm hoping you'll act as an intermediary between me and Rhodes Island. In return, I will give you an opportunity to come back to Rhine Lab.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]

[name="Mayer"]Eh, this all sounds like you guys are about to do something bad.

[name="Muelsyse"]Don't get the wrong idea, Ms. Mayer. This is just business.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#7")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Most things in the world aren't full of tender loving care.
[name="Muelsyse"]Just like how Rhodes Island only took in Saria because they saw value in her.
[name="Muelsyse"]And just like how Saria handed Anthony to you guys because she thought you two would be able to escort him back to Rhodes Island safely.
[name="Muelsyse"]As for me, I believe that even if Rhodes Island does end up taking Anthony in, they aren't going to offer him a helping hand just because he tells them about his past.
[name="Muelsyse"]We can slap a fancy label on everything to make them seem less ugly on the outside, but that doesn't actually make them any more beautiful.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Let me give you an example. I could tell you I have very little power within the company, and then sing the praises of Control and tell you how amazing of a leader she is to make you think helping me is actually the right call.
[name="Muelsyse"]If I had done that, you definitely wouldn't have reacted the same way as you just did.

[name="Muelsyse"]And, you know, I'm actually really good at doing that.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]But I didn't do that out of the respect I have for Ms. Silence after our conversation today.

[name="Silence"]From where you stand, what you've done couldn't be more correct, and I also think you've extended to me plenty of goodwill gestures.
[name="Silence"]It's just, I'm sorry to say this, I can't bring myself to agree with the way you think. That's all.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#4")]
[name="Muelsyse"]......
[name="Muelsyse"]It kinda feels like I made myself a new enemy without knowing.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]You mentioned keeping Energy in check. Did something happen inside Rhine Lab?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#1")]
[name="Muelsyse"]If you aren't going to make this deal with me, then I really can't tell you about any of that.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Of course, if you don't plan on calling it quits here, I'm sure you'll find out one day.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]I...

[name="Muelsyse"]Anyway, I'm throwing in the towel.
[name="Muelsyse"]I'm not really that confident I fight a buff dude like Anthony with just a clone.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#2")]
[name="Silence"]?!
[Character(name="char_242_mayer#2")]
[name="Mayer"]A clone?!
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#6")]
[name="Muelsyse"]That's right, this is just a clone. Looks real, doesn't it?
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]Let me leave you with an advice, Researcher Silence.
[name="Muelsyse"]You may think that helping Anthony is the right thing to do.
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#7")]
[name="Muelsyse"]But that couldn't be further from the truth.
[name="Muelsyse"]It's laughable to think the Simon Co. was merely a victim in their fight with HydeBro.
[name="Muelsyse"]Both of them fought that battle because they were bent on bringing the other side down. It's just Old Smith wasn't playing the game as well as his opponent was.
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#4")]
[name="Silence"]......
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#7")]
[name="Muelsyse"]In other words, if Smith had managed to make his move before HydeBro did, it would be the Hydes that's hunkering down in Bunkerhill right now instead of his family.
[name="Muelsyse"]From that point of view, is Anthony really just a victim?
[Character(name="char_108_silent_1#3")]
[name="Silence"]But...
[Character(name="char_249_muesys_1#5")]
[name="Muelsyse"]What do you think, Anthony?
[Character(name="char_264_Mountain_1#7")]
[name="Anthony"]I can't deny that.

[name="Muelsyse"]But there are no 'ifs' in this world. I know that.
[name="Muelsyse"]Researcher Silence, I am telling you all this because I want you to understand this—
[name="Muelsyse"]If you want to do the right thing, you need to first be able to tell what actually is the right thing. Beyond that, you also need to understand that doing the right thing doesn't necessarily mean you don't have to pay the price.
