This was my first memory.
I was around five or six years old at the time, I can't remember from before that. I only vaguely remember coming into contact with a strange thing called the 'Voice of Mundane,' and nearly lost my life.
Staring at the pure-white dress in front of me, I was filled with thoughts that I'd become some obscure little aristocrat.
I thought I'd live the rest of my life in peace, with the exception of the occasional headache and the auditory hallucinations from the Voice of Mundane.
