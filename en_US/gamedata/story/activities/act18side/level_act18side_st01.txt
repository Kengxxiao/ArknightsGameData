Kreide, somewhat dejectedly, bows.
He slowly takes a seat, and steadies the cello between his knees.
With a hand on his bow, and the other on the strings, the dismay is all but swept from his face, leaving only concentration.
From the cello's strings flows an ornate melody, gradually filling the whole hall.
After a number of bars, Kreide's performance reaches its sweetest point, when a concert flute joins from below the stage out of nowhere.
The noble in black plays the flute, accompanying Kreide's cello, and he paces his way onto the stage.
Kreide is briefly startled, but nevertheless concludes the passage with his own cadence, while the noble follows the cello's ending with his own, briefest cadenza.

[name="Andante"]A lot of musicians have nobles as backers. Nothing strange about it.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#7$1", name2="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Andante"]Some do it because they're not good enough themselves, so they see a really skilled musician and leap for them. They like how it makes them look better all around.

[name="Andante"]I can't figure out this Ebenholz either, though. Maybe he is just appreciating a fellow maestro.

[name="Andante"]Hibiscus, you were here to investigate the Serendipitous Infected Prognosis Phenomenon, weren't you?
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#9$1", name2="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Hibiscus"]Erk.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#9$1", name2="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Andante"]And our branch is too small. We don't have what it takes to admit patients like a hospital.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#9$1", name2="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Andante"]Examinations, diagnoses, prescriptions for milder cases, getting patients in touch with other organizations when they need hospitalization—that's our limit.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus=1)]
[name="Hibiscus"]But I'm still a little worried.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#4$1", name2="avg_npc_501_1#1$1",focus=2)]
[name="Andante"]In that case... Kreide's application is over, anyhow. Let's go catch up and ask him, see if we can offer him any help, okay?

[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"]Typically, any patient should receive standard treatment with indicators at this level, no matter how they feel themselves. I suggest hospitalized recovery.
[Character(name="avg_npc_495_1#1$1")]
[name="Grandpa"]Standard treatment, hospitalized recovery...
[Character(name="avg_npc_495_1#1$1")]
[name="Grandpa"]I hear Rhodes Island is just as much a business. You might be pitying me, giving me the test with no charge, but there's no such thing as a free lunch for me, eh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"]We're partnered with some organizations in Vyseheim. We can refer patients to them.
[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"]They have collaborative protocols in place with Rhodes Island. The prices will be cheaper compared to anywhere else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"]Given your present circumstances, I can try to talk down their fees further, or I could help offset expenses on both sides...

[name="Grandpa"]What could possibly be happening behind you when an aristocrat gives you money for no good reason?

[Character(name="avg_npc_495_1#2$1")]
[name="Grandpa"]*sigh* He might mean no harm, and an old man like me totting about without any grand standing or friend in power won't be worth much to exploit.

[name="Grandpa"]The hospitals still wouldn't be angels to me, even if they do admit me. I don't want my life depending on their whimsy.
[Character(name="avg_npc_495_1#1$1")]

[name="Kreide"]No. I already agreed with Ebenholz. The money he gives me is for treating your sickness!

[Character(name="avg_npc_501_1#1$1")]
[name="Andante"]Hibiscus, I understand how you feel... but we don't have beds here, and our medication stores are for emergency response.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#1$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]If we can have him recovering here, we'll be able to monitor his health condition more tightly. I'm sure it'd be of help to our investigation too.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#1$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]I can clear my own guest bed for him to take. Medication-wise, we'll sell at our partners' prices. I'll write a report after the fact explaining the situation.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#8$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]That should all be watertight under procedure, right?

[name="Andante"]I think... that works out.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#8$1")]
