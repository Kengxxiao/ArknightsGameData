[name="Gertrude"]I came because you woke me up, why else?
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]I'll take that as, you heard the musical Arts rippling outwards and realized your plans had been discovered.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]That's correct.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Ahh, what a pity. With just one more day, I would've enjoyed a complete success.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Don't you think you should be thinking about how to escape? Do you seriously think your plan will proceed as normal if you manage to take us out here?
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Ebenholz won't help you anymore, and regardless of what you were planning for the duet, it's not going to happen now!
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Really? That's not how I see it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]As long as Ebenholz and Kreide are here, my plan has not failed.
[name="Gertrude"]As long as I eliminate you, I can continue negotiating with Graf Urtica. He is quite familiar with the art of the noble dealings, and changing his mind is hardly an impossibility.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#6$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Most importantly, I don't think you lot can actually beat me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]If the three of you were equal in power to Graf Urtica, then I certainly would have to watch my step. But you three, aha... Pardon my rudeness.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Don't waste your breath.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Graf Urtica, why don't we both take a step back? What do you say?
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Take a step back?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]I dismantle these giant amplifiers, and you continue working with me. That way, only Kreide has to die. Not a bad deal considering he only has a few days to live anyway, right?
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]In your dreams.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#13$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]That truly is a shame. Due to unfortunate circumstances, you were forced to choose the path most ill-suited for you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]If that is your heart's desire, then so be it. What a shame––
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Shut up...
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]You'll regret this for the rest of your life.

[name="Ebenholz"]I said, shut up!!
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]The time for talk is over. It seems we can only settle this with a fight.
[name="Gertrude"]If I win, the self-appointed guardians of the Afterglow will have to behave themselves and keep their mouths shut so I can continue negotiating with Graf Urtica.
[name="Gertrude"]If you win, then there's nothing more to say. A win is a win.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#13$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Take your wand out, Graf Urtica. Or do you plan to have those two Infected fight for you?
[character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Like I said, your provocations won't get you anywhere.
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Hibiscus, stay out of this. Today, I swear I'll––
[character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#6$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"]Think carefully about where we are, and what's all around us!
[name="Hibiscus"]Unless you're able to do this without any musical Arts, you'll drive all the inhabitants of Vyseheim insane before the disease ever comes!
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#13$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Tsk tsk. You're a quick thinker, Fräulein Hibiscus.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#13$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Since you caught on so quickly, I suppose there's no other choice but to take it outside.
[name="Gertrude"]Let me get this out there first. Rid yourself of the notion that escape counts as victory. While I personally dislike roughing up innocent bystanders, I can't say the same for my underlings.
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]You must not have a whole lot of confidence in yourself, based on how many you brought with you.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]I'm so glad to hear your sharp wit once more. I'm almost moved to tears.
[name="Gertrude"]Are you feeling better now, Graf Urtica?
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Of course, Dame Strollo.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Let's head outside and fight to our hearts' content.
[name="Gertrude"]There must be nobody for you to spar with back in Urtica. Should be lonely, right?
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]If I did, I wouldn't be playing with an old bag like you.
[name="Ebenholz"]After all, you've never even challenged your own brother for his title. You have to wait for him to die before you can move up. I'm guessing you've never bested him in a fight before.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#6$1")]
[name="Gertrude"]Very good, very good. I'm starting to hate you more and more.
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]The feeling is mutual.
