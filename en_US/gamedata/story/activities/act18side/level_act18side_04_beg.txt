[name="Ebenholz"]I have no idea what you're trying to say.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Do you really not understand me, or are you just––
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Fine, I'll explain it one more time.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] The reason I came to the Afterglow was to investigate why the Infected people here were suddenly getting better.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] But according to our visits over the last few days, the Infected here in the Afterglow are not getting better, but exhibiting something called a 'false recovery.'
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] In other words, the patient's condition appears to be getting better, but in reality is taking a turn for the worse.
[Character(name="avg_npc_482_1#3$1")]
[name="Kreide"]Why would they appear to be improving then if they're getting worse?
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#2$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Let me explain it another way.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Generally speaking, whenever the body is injured, the best outcome is for it to 'return to its original state.'
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] If it is unable to return to its original state, the body will mobilize its non-damaged parts to cover for the functions lost through the injury, a process we call 'compensation.'
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Right now, most of the Infected in the Afterglow have activated their body's compensation functions, causing them to appear to be in very good shape.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] But inside them, where the eye cannot see, the severity of their Oripathy is rapidly getting worse.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] At the current rate, a certain cohort is about to enter the decompensation stage.
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Decompensation?
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Once the extent of the damage exceeds the body's maximum ability to compensate, the fragile equilibrium is broken and the patient quickly lapses into the acute exacerbation stage of Oripathy, where their condition deteriorates sharply and becomes life-threatening.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] Actually, there are already people starting to enter the acute stage.
[Character(name="avg_npc_482_1#4$1")]
[name="Kreide"]How...?
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]I get the gist of what you're talking about, but what does this have to do with––
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Wait, are you saying that Kreide is at risk too?
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] No...
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#11$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] That isn't the problem. Based on an analysis of our findings so... You and Kreide seem to be the primary factors behind this occurrence.
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]Kreide and I caused all of this?!
[Character(name="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2")]
[name="Ebenholz"]That's complete nonsense!
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] After analyzing your activities and movements, I've confirmed that you... or maybe something you're carrying, is strongly correlated with the incidence of false recovery.
[Character(name="avg_1024_hbisc2_1#5$1")]
[name="Hibiscus"] For example, the worker in the laundromat beside your residence said the day before that she 'felt especially good.' Her condition worsened dramatically last night, and she was nearly taken to hospice care.

[name="Gertrude"]Stated simply, the Voice of Mundane within Kreide is damaged.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]Damaged???
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]When you cast Arts, the Voice of Mundane inside you will activate, therefore assisting you. Correct?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]Yes, I do hear a faint, shrill melody as I'm casting Arts. How can something like that be damaged?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Kreide's Voice of Mundane has always been in an active state, unlike how you are able to turn yours off.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]In other words, he's been unconsciously casting Arts all around him, with no ability to control it.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]If you ask him, he'd probably tell you that he's always been able to hear some sort of vague melody in his head.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#2$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]You can understand this phenomenon as 'leakage.'
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#12$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]This 'false recovery' is a product of the Voice of Mundane's leakage – indiscriminately increasing the activity of Originium in the surroundings, using the power of Originium to 'heal' the nearby Infected...
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#12$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]However, the source of healing energy is taken directly from the Originium within the body of each Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#12$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Using the Infected themselves as Arts devices, using the Originium inside their bodies to enhance their compensatory functions... This is the 'false recovery' caused by Kreide's Voice of Mundane.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Kreide has been in this state for a long, long time, continuously affecting the Infected around him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]If this has been going on for so long, someone should've figured it out by now!
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]The credit for that goes to you, Herr Ebenholz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#7$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]Me?!
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#3$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Resonanz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]Resonanz amplifies the leakage of Kreide's Voice of Mundane, which is causing an explosion in the recent cases of false recovery?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]That's the situation, yes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#2$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]Alright, I see exactly what's going on now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#10$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]I hereby withdraw from your plan.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Freedom is at your fingertips, and you're going to give it up just like that?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]I'm not crazy enough to buy my freedom with the lives of an entire swath of Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#2$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]You've been shaken by that woman from Rhodes Island.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]This false recovery is indeed not a good thing, but your concert with Kreide is just a few days away.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]After a few days, your Voice of Mundane will be removed, and then you'll leave Vyseheim. Nobody will even notice that we're short of a few Infected.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. If you walk away now, Graf Urtica's shadow will follow you your entire life.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#8$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Is that what you really want?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#5$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]No, but I won't do that either.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#1$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]Goodbye, Dame Gertrude.
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#6$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=1)]
[name="Gertrude"]Where are you going?
[Character(name="avg_npc_484_1#6$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#1$2",focus=2)]
[name="Ebenholz"]None of your business.
