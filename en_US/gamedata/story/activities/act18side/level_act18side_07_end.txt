[character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#7$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#6$2",focus=1)]
[name="Czerny"]If the Voice can be said to be a string of melodies, then whether those remnants who used you for their experiment, or Gertrude...
[name="Czerny"]Their aim has to be to conduct the Originium Arts contained within that melody, or should I say, the melody that flows within this Originium Arts.
[name="Czerny"]Which is to say, their exploration of the Voice is entirely to unearth the supposed secrets within.
[name="Czerny"]In plain words, they're trying to make the Voice more 'clear,' more 'beautiful.'
[name="Czerny"]Thus, there is one thing I can very definitively tell you—
[character(name="avg_4047_pianst_1#5$1",name2="avg_4046_ebnhlz_1#6$2",focus=1)]
[name="Czerny"]There is no method that can 'transfer' the Voice anywhere in these plans.

[name="Czerny"]But that's not because doing so would be too difficult. Precisely the opposite. It's because, in their eyes, it would be a waste of what they have.
[name="Czerny"]Because every melody the Witch King left behind is different. Each comes from its own period, and contains its own completely separate emotions and ideas.
[name="Czerny"]What sense can there be in putting two entirely different songs together?
[name="Czerny"]Just as when you performed together, the further you pursue it, the more disastrous the effects become.
[name="Czerny"]Even the Originium slugs fled because they felt your performance to be far too ear-bleeding.
[character(name="avg_npc_482_1#12$1")]
[name="Kreide"]I presume they've done similar transfer experiments before, and realized how bad the results were... then.

[name="Czerny"]They did.
[name="Czerny"]However, even if two pieces are diametrically opposed, a sufficient lead-in can still be enough to accomplish the transition.
[name="Czerny"]Therefore, I want you to perform my Morgen und Abend.
[name="Czerny"]Upon which, I want you to dig your own selves out from within the piece, just as you did that evening.

[character(name="avg_npc_482_1#9$1")]

[name="Hibiscus"]From what I know, when the Twin Empresses ascended to the throne, they issued an edict that forbade all Witch King era research, and the Voice of Mundane research obviously fell into that category.
[name="Hibiscus"]But if the Voice of Mundane is really that amazing, I can't imagine that not a single person has turned his attention to it in the twenty years since the Witch King was overthrown.
[name="Hibiscus"]What's more... 'The Witch King left his mark within.' 'The Witch King weaved his power into the melody.' The Witch King himself is the core of these ideas.
[name="Hibiscus"]Deep down, their pursuit of the Voice of Mundane might actually be nothing more than worshipping the Witch King himself.
[name="Hibiscus"]And given the way that Mr. Biegler does things, I'd say a spy's principles lie with serving the Twin Empresses.
[name="Hibiscus"]In other words, to spies like you, the Voice of Mundane doesn't further the Twin Empresses' interests in any way.

The Voice of Mundane did not have a name, at first.
The melody was abandoned by the Witch King, after all.
It was a melody improvised by him on the spur of the moment and transcribed by his court musicians.
If the Witch King's complete pieces are howls from a deep abyss, then these fragments are indeed still melodies of the mortal realm.
And thus, these fragments were named the Voice of Mundane.
Be that as it may, the Witch King's power is still immensely terrifying.

One moment, he's suddenly filled with hatred toward the Witch King. The next second, he has a heartfelt admiration for him.
One moment, he feels as though he is a newborn child, but he immediately feels the passage of time and its effects on his body. The very next second, he is as old as the hills.
He forces himself to keep his appearance intact with what little sanity he has left, but he feels as though he is walking in a boundless desert. The sandstorm is too powerful, and he cannot open his eyes.
He tries his best to shake the sand off. Then, he sees a towering wall that reaches even the sky. There is nothing on the wall. No pain, no anger, and no death.
It's a simple, unadorned wall.
At that very moment, he finally realizes. That is a wall he will never be able to overcome.
His mind is instantly filled with fear.
