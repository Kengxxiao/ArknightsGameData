A few days later...
Stitch is working hard at the forum again today.
Just like the journey to the surface, the dressing of the city is a task that requires the supervision of all the citizens.
And as the face of the city, the dome's renovation is naturally the most important task.
Which is why it is also necessary for the design tasks to be done in the forum, where everyone can see.
And as Master Edge claims, it also saves time.
[name="Stitch Canvas"]That darned old man. He's definitely having me do this because he thinks it's funny.
Noticing Edge's smug look below, Stitch finds himself immediately incensed.
However, not even he himself expected to adapt so quickly to these work conditions.
When he has to take questions from passersby, when he has to hear opinions, and even when he stands up and defends his beliefs in an argument—
None of that actually carries as much pressure as he thought it would.
With Edge grinning away at him, Stitch is definitely irritated, but he also knows what people must be thinking about him.
Just like how they must know what he is thinking.
