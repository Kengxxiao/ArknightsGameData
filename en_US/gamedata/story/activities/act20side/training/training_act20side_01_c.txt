[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_ardign")] Wow, a whole new bunch of Originium slugs showed up! Steward, once they get in front of me, use the Self-Driving Cart to deal with them, and I'll block the rest!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")] Hold on, Cardigan, we've got an even better option. We can use the <@tu.kw>Self-Driver One-Way Road</> to change our Self-Driving Cart's course, and extend the route it takes.

Just get the Self-Driver One-Way Road <@tu.kw>deployed right here</>...
[Tutorial(waitForSignal="select_direction", dialogHead="$avatar_ardign", animStyle="Drag", \
          startX=-215, startY=-110, endX=-193, endY=90)] \
And then <@tu.kw>face it up</>, and we're set.

[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")] This way, when the <@tu.kw>Self-Driving Cart</> passes through, it'll change its original direction and travel upward!
[PopupDialog(dialogHead="$avatar_stward")] But we have to pay attention, because each Self-Driver One-Way Road or allied unit can only turn any one Self-Driving Cart <@tu.kw>once</>.

Cardigan, let the Self-Driving Cart wipe out those Originium slugs at range, and we'll focus on handling the enemy in front of us. That way, we can steady our defensive line.
