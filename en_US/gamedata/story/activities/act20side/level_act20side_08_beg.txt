Avdotya thought she would struggle to find words.
But she found her memories pouring out as soon as she opened her mouth.
It was not that she did not know what to say; it was that she had too much to say and did not know where to start.
The Durins do not know what it means for her. But she does.
This is the first time she's looked back on her past since coming to the Durins.
She thought time would let the past fade, let her forget that she was once a woman of Ursus.
Now, though, she realizes that the past never truly goes away.
But meeting Gavial and the people she brought with her helps her realize—
That is not so bad.
The past pulls her down bit by bit, along with the Durins listening to her story.
[StopMusic(fadetime=2)]
But she no longer feels pain from it, and thus neither do the Durins.
