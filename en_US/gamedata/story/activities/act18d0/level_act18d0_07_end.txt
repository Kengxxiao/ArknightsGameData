[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  ......
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Something on your mind?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  I've been on the run with you for a while now, but you're still keeping me in the dark for a lot things. Like that old Savra with amnesia.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Long ago... there used to be a city here. The only nomadic city in Ibut's vast territory.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The building of a city is a miracle in itself, but, before the Reefsteep Padishah, no one had managed to unite all of Ibut. And the symbol of that unity? That city among the golden sands.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That was what inspired everyone to unite under his rule. That era was not that long ago, and I believe there are still a fair amount of people out there wallowing in their homeland's former glory.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Unfortunately, it was not meant to last. The city met its fate during a Catastrophe. Supposedly, after the padishah had evacuated all his citizens and workers, he simply lamented and lashed out at the gathering storm.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Lash out... at the Catastrophe?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That's how it was recorded in history, at least, but it most likely actually happened.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Catastrophe laid waste on the padishah's grand achievement in a brief moment. In just one night, all its citizens became refugees. They very well could have built a new home together, but with the destruction of the city... everything was left behind in that sandstorm, forgotten.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  ......
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Old Isin was among them. The lords ameer and the new padishah didn't want to spend a huge sum of money to rebuild the city. Thanks to that, their descendants likely had no idea where to begin to rebuild their homeland.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This filled them with grief, and this is also why they give all those who still respect the 'Land of Reefsteep' the same amount of respect.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  So... Is that why they're helping us...? Because it's like helping out their countrymen?
[name="Elliot"]  From the looks of it, we'll get to leave Sargon soon, right?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If everything goes well, we should be leaving Sargon territory within the month.

[name="Elliot"]  And we're going to Ursus?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That's right.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Why?
[name="Elliot"]  I don't get it. Did you really abandon everything you had in Columbia and came to Sargon just to keep our research from becoming the powder keg that sparks a war?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  None of you could've possibly foreseen what the chain of events would eventually lead to.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  And you can...?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  It would be so much easier for you if you killed me and destroyed the box now... but, here you are, letting me hold onto it.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Do you want me to do that?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  No...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  At first... I was really bothered that I was the only survivor, but I don't feel that way anymore.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Kal'tsit... If I give you this box now, will you do something for me... for us?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You know the Ibuti Lord Ameer was dragged into this mess. From Sargon to Columbia, the accomplices of this conspiracy are everywhere.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  But I still want them to pay the price...
[name="Elliot"]  See, this box—It's my one and only trump card.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But once it's destroyed, you'll have nothing—
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  —Nothing?
[name="Elliot"]  Actually... Kal'tsit, ever since the beginning, I've always felt I didn't need this box.
[name="Elliot"]  I remember all the details, and I can replicate our past results.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Of course, it'll take a long time, and there's probably going to be lots of difficult issues... but I think I can do it.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  If, just like you said, there's some kind of way to turn this Originium energy source into a weapon—
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  ......
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  This is the first time you are looking me in the eyes, Kal'tsit. The first time you aren't treating me as a kid or someone to be protected, but as a scientist, a Columbian.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Perhaps I've been underestimating you because of your age, Elliot.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Relax, I won't let these bad guys use the Professor's research as they please. I won't.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  But I will use it to finish one last thing.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You don't understand how Professor Thorne's research came to be.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  I heard him say before that the basis of the technology came from a set of ancient ruins that archaeologists found in Sarkaz, and it could provide nomadic cities an entirely new and convenient energy source—
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  —I'll say it again. If misused, this could easily bury half of Sargon under its golden sands.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Hmm...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1#8", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Well, you were the head of the mercenaries to begin with. You probably have a few other tricks up your sleeve just to be safe, don't you, 'Adviser?'
[name="Elliot"]  Such as... taking me out right now. The way you people like to take care of things.

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  A simple sample such as this won't help explain why. Once you master the core principles behind it, you will be able to craft from it a grenade capable of wiping out an entire city with ease.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  What do you think will happen if the Ibuti Lord Ameer or Padishah Murad got their hands on this technology?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The truth is... this Originium crystal sample is the only one of its kind.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  As an Originium crystal, it actually isn't particularly special on its own. It is how it came to take its current form that makes it special. It was found in an excavation.
