[name="Kal'tsit"]  I was deeply honored by your invitation, but with sudden matters to attend to, the monastery could not prepare suitable evening attire for me. They found only this outfit buried in the storeroom. I hope you shan't mind.

[name="Merry Noblewoman"]  Oh, I remember. Thomson's ruthless. He even said himself, 'The clash of ideas ought to be a ruthless thing.' Truly frightening, he is.

[name="Tipsy Businessman"]  Hoh! Toron's not his land in name, mind, it's for all of us to manage, but I'll admit the Count deserves his reputation for leading! I do have to respect the man!
[Character(name="avg_npc_177", name2="avg_npc_176", focus=1)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  And lest we forget, he's had multiple invitations to the gatherings at Londinium. Don't you think our little place—allow me to admit our border situation—deserves some sense of pride?

[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=1)]
[name="Merry Noblewoman"]  If Thomson liked it, chances are it was the latter, wasn't it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  Hmph. You lot really do trust him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]  Papa really put him in high esteem. He even wanted to go to Deity Grypherburg himself to visit him, but business always meant he had to put it off, and this year with his old injuries flaring up again, he wasn't able to go.
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Your father was injured?
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1#4", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]  That's right. He broke his knee, and then put off surgery for too long, so it's not fully treated.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_170_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  I warned him. Ah, no idea what happened last year. He came scrabbling back with wounds all over, and all he'd say was he ran into a robber and dropped off a cliff. Wasn't interested in saying much else.
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1#4", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Do you want to go to Ursus? Miss Heidi?

[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Now that won't do! The death of the last Emperor and the rebellions had a profound effect on the country. Should you want to study there, you'd do well to wait a few years first.
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]  I'm just talking about it... What impression do you have of the country?
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I'll tell you a story.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It's the story of how Ursus's Sixth Army were annihilated, without a trace, by a bottle of vodka.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  Well, this rumor doesn't sound plausible at all.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  When any event is boiled down to its cause, its conclusion tends to sound unexpected. We're all used to the process, aren't we?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  That does make sense.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It began with a ruffian from the Army 'collecting rent' in one of their garrison regions, and without realizing, he menaced a noble.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That act fermented the whole way through. The Sixth Army then were always considered utterly corrupt, the old nobles' power rooted too deep, while the Fifth Army were unconditionally obedient to the young Emperor and the brand new State Council.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  We have no way to know for sure who fired the first shot, but as for the outcome, the Fifth Army ultimately seized the chance to revolt, and in between two cities' paths, started a direct firefight with the Sixth Army.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=2)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  The prologue to 'The Great Rebellion' comes in many editions. I've definitely heard a few things of the Sixth Army's varied deeds.
[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=1)]
[name="Merry Noblewoman"]  They fought just like that?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If it were that simple, then it wouldn't have been dubbed 'The Great Rebellion.'
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Being a border guard outfit, the Fourth Army, with a domain of authority and influence decidedly not in the hinterlands, suddenly switched sides to support the State Council, and proactively declared no relationship to the 'traitors' in the Sixth Army.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  After the execution of a few prepared scapegoats, the old nobility had only the Sixth and Eighth Armies left in hand.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Come winter the following year, the nobility backing the Eighth Army pulled that same trick, capitulating alike to the Emperor.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And so, the bitter fate of the Sixth Army who had staked it all on one throw, we can well imagine.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And the cause of all of this—very simple, one we all know. Simply a drunk ruffian, taking the vodka bottle he had in hand to attack a young noble.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=2)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  A marvelous story, Cleric Kal'tsit, and might I even confirm, this tale is little removed from the reality at all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Heidi, I would not tell you that 'this is how Ursus is.' Every civilization in this world deserves you seeing it for yourself. They should be appreciated, and have to be reflected upon.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  In that Ursus you admire, what have you seen?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Perhaps the farms and public houses, perhaps the grand heroes, perhaps the highs and lows of life in Deity Grypherburg's opera house. But what I've seen is the Great Rebellion's aftermath, an age on the verge of collapse.
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heidi"]  Might Victoria have such an age of its own someday?
[Character(name="avg_npc_169_1", name2="char_003_kaltsn08_1", focus=2)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I will not guarantee it either way, Miss Heidi.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  How could it! Here, you little child. Are you afraid now, because of Cleric Kal'tsit's smidgen story of Ursus?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  I've no intent to insult the Ursus people, but the Empire of Ursus is unarguably a savage, unreasonable nation.

[name="Heidi"]  But right now, isn't Londinium just as—
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  —Don't even say it. Though it pains us all that it happened, did Victoria waver for even a moment?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_176", focus=2)]
[name="Tipsy Businessman"]  Alright, alright, Count, seeing as the topic's come around, I think it's high time you told us about that trip to Londinium, yes? That's what we're most interested in.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  What high nobility did you meet?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  I'd be honored to tell. Truth is, on the way, the Duke of Normandy personally invited me to a shindig, together at his flagship...
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  What! And you managed to keep from telling us all the way to today...!
[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=1)]
[name="Merry Noblewoman"]  My, it was the Duke of Normandy himself... He always did detest Leithanians. Did he and the envoys of the Empresses' Voice have a scuffle?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  No, but by his retainer's words, the good Duke never once made eye contact with those gorgeous envoys that evening.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  Ah-ha, now that's the proper manner of a 'Duke.'
[name="Pretentious Man"]  Ursus's theatrical Grand Dukes might number more in hundreds than tens—alright, maybe not that many, but they are quite unchecked, and if I might add, somewhat incompetent too.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  That's a form of arrogance, but I must say, everyone who's experienced the Londinium manner for themselves would echo the sentiment.
[name="Count Vincent"]  I trust the Duke of Normandy need only rely on his own power to make those Leithanian greed-blinded extremists know their place for a few dozen years. Let alone the fact we've certainly more than a single Duke...

[name="Heidi"]  Hm? No... I'm still thinking about what Cleric Kal'tsit said. Could I talk with her alone for a bit?
[Character(name="avg_npc_177")]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  Oh, if we're to talk Londinium without Kal'tsit, it would certainly be much duller.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You flatter me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Now, no rush. I see the Baron of Rye is calling at me, so I'll need to chit-chat with him now. I assure you, I'll be back shortly to tell the full tale.
