[name="Count Vincent"]  It is a great city. All Victorians should find time to pay it a visit and gaze upon its magnificence.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]
[name="Pretentious Man"]  So you are saying our respectable dukes have not yet arrived at a conclusion?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Yes, that is correct. They haven't yet. For the time being, Londinium is still a city without a master.
[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=1)]
[name="Merry Noblewoman"]  So I take it you had the fortune and privilege to tour Londinium with the Duke of Normandy?
[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=2)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Alas, the Duke is forbidden from entering Londinium by law. Of course, he is a fine gentleman, so he would never be so presumptuous as to invite himself in, so we instead enjoyed dinner on a ship together in the Londinium countryside.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_176", focus=2)]
[name="Tipsy Businessman"]  What kind of a hero is the Duke?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_176", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Well... he is the most gracious and erudite of nobles. His views in economics and politics are unique and unparalleled. Not only that, but my understanding is that he is well-trained in music, and he possesses an impressive art collection, testament to his respect for the arts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3", name2="avg_npc_176", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  It is because of heroes like him that Victoria remains prosperous as ever!

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Despite not having a ruler for the past dozen or so years, Victoria has managed to maintain its stability.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  But the truth is that the Dukes were getting in each other's way behind the scenes, and that's not all...
[name="Heidi"]  If so many Victorian nobles actually fell victim to food poisoning and hunting accidents, then the country's noble rule would've crumbled to dust long ago.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And three years ago, your father nearly experienced that first hand.

[name="Heidi"]  Yes...

[name="Kal'tsit"]  His leg is actually injured.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  There is a noble who is an academic enemy of my father. They were at a cocktail party together, and he made his move after the party.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  That must have been well disguised, if it was thought to be an accident.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  My father had a few leads, but he didn't want this affair to get in the way of relaying intelligence.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  How many of Thomson's men are there in this manor right now?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  A lot of them, such as the ones you were talking to earlier... They also paid my father's villa a visit before tonight's party.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Richard was quite critical of your father just now...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Ahaha... I suppose he spoke much of it from his heart... He has had quite the rivalry with my father for the past several years...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Yet they still assemble around Thomson. Your father is a good leader.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Not without your guidance, Lady Kal'tsit.
[name="Heidi"]  Who could have thought back then... that the Laterano cleric who came to visit Victoria would become our most trusted mentor?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Our goals are one and the same.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Kal'tsit. They will get out of this unscathed... We will get out of this unscathed, will we?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Heidi...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You need to look around with your own eyes. If you truly wish to step into this world, then you cannot allow civilization's facades blind you anymore... You need to see this world yourself.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Comforting words are meaningless. You will grow up one day.

[name="Merry Noblewoman"]  My, did they upset you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_175", name2="avg_npc_170_1", focus=2)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Right... As you can see, it was the Dukes' graciousness that forged the peace and prosperity enjoyed by our country today.
[name="Count Vincent"]  However, and this is something that even the traitors in Columbia are aware of, we also cannot deny that it has been a long time since Victoria has seen a rightful ruler ascend its throne.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_177", focus=2)]

[name="Heidi"]  Even this trip to Londinium. It hardly achieved any meaningful results.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This isn't your father's opinion. Thomson is not so foolish as to let radical atmosphere get to his head.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  But that's how the adults always complain to my father.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  No foolish nobles would ever receive an audience with a real Duke.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Do you think that the Duke of Normandy really didn't intimidate Vincent with any harsh demands?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Toron is near the border, and there are few people here. In other words, this place is not under the influence of any major forces.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Uncle Vincent...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This nobleman may seem uninterested in anything except celebrating this false peace with music and shows, but he is actually doing his best to uphold Toron's peace. That's despite the peace here... is fragile and easily broken.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  His arrogance and temperance are just at the right level to hide his thoughts well, and those who actually understand his true intentions are few and far between.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Thomson would never place so much trust on a count severely lacking in courage, insight, and judgement. They may seem like they are heading down different paths, but these paths will lead them to the same destination.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Hehe... It's nice to hear you say so.
[name="Heidi"]  Kal'tsit, are you not going to look at your mail?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  From Londinium to Toron, these letters have made it halfway across Victoria.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  How many hands has the letter passed through, and how many of them know of the whole truth of these events?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  There are lots—
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Workers, newsboys, popcorn hawkers, park gardeners. They knew nothing of the letter's contents. They didn't even know who these words ultimately belong to.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But now this letter has made it to Thomson, and now me.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  There is nothing to worry about.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  I see...
[name="Heidi"]  But what about the other one? The one from 'Kazdel'...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It was handed straight to Thomson by a Sarkaz Messenger.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I told him how to contact Thomson himself, but if things had gone according to plan, he would've handed this straight to me.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn08_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Yeah... but when that Sarkaz made it to Victoria...

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Mon3tr, do not underestimate him.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He's no normal human.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  You hid a device here in the garden... No... a creature...? *Hiss*...
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  You know of the 'demons,' and you have a monster serving you. One that Ursus's vast knowledge is yet unaware of.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  Perhaps your crimes have far exceeded my expectations.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Or perhaps I managed to make an impression on a Royal Guard.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  *Hiss*...!
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  I won't deny it, traitor.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  But you have my curiosity. What drove you to betray our homeland...? No, no... Perhaps... my investigations did not fully uncover your entire past.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  And it looks like that is indeed the case. Unlike the criminals who escaped to Sami, it appears you still have a trick up your sleeve.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  Do not get the wrong idea... It is hardly a difficult matter... to kill you.
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]

[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  You needn't concern yourself. I know what I am doing.

[name="Mon3tr"]  (Wailing)—
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  *Hiss*... I did not expect it to be this hard.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  If your own flesh and blood is also as hardened, then, indeed, it makes you a formidable foe.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Mon3tr, come back. Don't chase after him.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Avoid the black mist. That's not mist at all.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  This is far beyond the normal realm of Originium Arts... It looks like it has really been too long since I last dealt with the Emperor's Blade. You and your men have made remarkable progress.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  ......
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  You know this much about our secrets...?!
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  Even the most senior Ursus scientist would never be allowed to meddle in the Royal Guards' ancient ritual...
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Ancient rituals. Yes, only the ceremonies of your crazed, self-proclaimed spiritual leaders could adorn your kinds with your demons.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You're a survivor of the Valley of the Setting Sun.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  *Hiss*...!
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Empire's will is always focused and unswerving, yet your goal seems to stray from your motherland's. At the very least, you are not that young.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You should not be fighting me, Royal Guard. Both you and I know that the job I finished was one that you and your men should've done yourselves, but never did.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  Don't be mistaken about where that right lies, traitor. You do not represent Deity Grypherburg's laws and prestige.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If you truly witnessed the whole uprising, Royal Guard, then you should understand this more so than anyone. The Empire's rise and fall has never truly been affected by dignity and honor.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  ......
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Let me ask you this, then. Did the last emperor ever truly look down on Victoria from the bottom of his heart?
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  ......
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  Perhaps I do not give you enough credit, traitor.
[name="'Emperor's Blade'"]  I will give you one last chance. Reveal your secrets, and I will grant you a dignified death.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Alas, given this death would have nothing to do with my own conviction, dignity was never on the table.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Mon3tr.
