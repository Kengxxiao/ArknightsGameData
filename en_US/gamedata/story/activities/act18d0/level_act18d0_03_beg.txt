[name="Count Vincent"]  What a splendid blizzard eve! Ladies and gentlemen, welcome, welcome, please come in. Allow the servants to brush the snow off your tops, and thaw yourselves by the brazier.
[character]
[name="Finely-Dressed Merchant"]  A good evening to you, Count. Truly a magnificent soirée, this is.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Welcome, welcome, Lady Diana. To meet you on the eve of the New Year is my honor entirely.
[character]
[name="Finely-Dressed Merchant"]  Nonsense. Now take a look, Count. I've a present for you, all the way from Kazimierz.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  What a beautiful pendant! My greatest thanks, Lady Diana, and send my well-wishes to your husband. Now, hurry along inside, we can't have the snow burying your gorgeous looks.
[character]
[name="Finely-Dressed Merchant"]  Hah! You speak as fine a line as ever.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Oh-ho, look who's here! If it isn't our 'Baron of Rye!'
[character]
[name="Courteous Nobleman"]  I could never shoulder a title as hefty as Baron, but here I am anyway, the pure nerve!
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  See what you're saying! We all respect you from the bottom of our hearts. Who spurns the man who feeds his people well, now? Ha ha ha!
[character]
[name="Courteous Nobleman"]  Ah, you're quite right. Once harvest comes next year, I'd be honored if you visit my humble home. The tallest windmills in Toron, the scent of flour everywhere. A stay sure to enchant you, if I do say so myself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Quite good! This blizzard shall pass, and next year will come trotting in right behind it with fine, fine harvests.
[character]
[name="Courteous Nobleman"]  My gratitude for your kind words.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Head in and warm yourself up, now. We're serving the spiced bread you so love tonight—of course, baked with most exquisite, fragrant flour, all sourced from your farms.
[character]
[name="Courteous Nobleman"]  How about you? Won't you come in? It's almost time... Let your good servants welcome the remaining guests.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Perhaps you speak sense, but no matter. I like to greet my invitees personally. They're all the most adorable people, whether noble or merchant, cleric or soldier.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Toron is a fine, fine place, isn't it?
[character]
[name="Courteous Nobleman"]  Why, you character, you...
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2")]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Now, let me see, we still have the Mister and Misses Arizona, that admirable lighthouse operator, and... hm?

[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3", name2="avg_npc_169_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Uncle Vincent, don't ruffle up my hair! I had to spend so long making it!
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Fine, fine. Ah, little Heidi, you've grown so much. What a dashing lady you are now.
[name="Count Vincent"]  However! Your father never sent word you'd be arriving today. Be candid with your uncle now, have you come on the sly?
[name="Count Vincent"]  And I say, you're still quite young. If your father saw your dress tonight, you'd be in for the nag, wouldn't you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Uncle! I'd hate him nagging at me. That's why I slipped off in the first place!
[name="Heidi"]  I heard you called out a gallery of VIPs and bright minds tonight, and I couldn't help my curiosity. Not to mention, my papa always wants me to broaden my scope, get out beyond the classroom, and isn't this the finest opportunity!
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  And you swear you're not here to see the boys, hoping for a chance meeting? You know, your father's told me, you've been absorbed in all those tawdry romance novels lately, and it's been worrying him so.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  How—How—How could I? I'm not such a naive girl now, ah ha ha, ha ha.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Your father worded it very well. Romanticism is all and well, but writing aiming to be consumed, pulling wool over the truths of life, so as to curry favor with readers and wring the last drop of worth from its material; there's nothing of value in it.
[name="Count Vincent"]  In that regard, all of Toron ought to be learning from your father.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Ahem, Uncle, let's drop the subject now. I feel embarrassed hearing this...
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  And honestly, my papa. Telling people off left and right when he was young, and in the end he made himself a businessman, made himself a huge fortune... The old guard in the association constantly joke about him. It drives me mad.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Some things up Life's sleeve you just can't refuse. Oh, well, imagine Thomson did it for you two ladies. Back when he was younger, he'd find any chance to grumble about his unrecognized talent to me. How's his health been lately?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Just his chronic pains. Once winter's gone, he'll be live and well as ever.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  So you availed yourself while your parents couldn't watch you, made off with your mother's clothes, and came to join the festivities?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Right—ah, no, I came on educational purposes, just as my father guided me.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Heidi...
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Heh heh. How about you just never saw me?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#4", name2="avg_npc_169_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  You've been quite too headstrong this time. Look at this awful snow today. Just suppose something had happened to you on the way, how would I ever explain to your father?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#4", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Ha, ha ha... well! Uncle, you see, it's so late now anyway. I can't just find a car and head back now, can I?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Oh, dear, child. Quick, in. Don't you freeze now.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3", name2="avg_npc_169_1#3", focus=2)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Heidi"]  Hooray! You're the best, Uncle!
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Er... but who are you still waiting for? Is there still some guest noble enough to wait like a snowman at the door?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Quite. An outstanding Laterano cleric.
[name="Count Vincent"]  Last year, your aunt caught some illness unawares, had a fever that wouldn't abate, and it's thanks to that cleric that it vanished.
[name="Count Vincent"]  We struck up concord afterwards, and I paid frequent visits. This cleric's not just fine with medicine, but has original views on all walks of life. Truly a mind-opener.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Huh... Well, if you vouch for them like this, they must be really incredible, right?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  But of course. If a person of those talents could swear loyalty to the Vincent family, it'd bring a deal of vigor to building the local land.
[name="Count Vincent"]  I even had every intent to invite that cleric along as a friend on my journey to Londinium, and your aunt would've appreciated the diversion, but would you know our rotten luck? Out on business.
[name="Count Vincent"]  So today, mark my words, I'll be introducing this insightful scholar to one and all.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Uncle... is that Laterano cleric—a gentleman by any chance? A refined, mannerly Sankta, maybe? On the older side, or?
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2", name2="avg_npc_169_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  There it is, you little scamp! Swearing your pure intentions, even!
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#2", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[name="Heidi"]  Just asking!
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  Don't get too excited. She's a meritorious woman. And she isn't a Sankta. Very rare to see, but all suggests she's a Feline cleric. I truly do appreciate people like her.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=2)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Heidi"]  Ahem...!
[name="Heidi"]  U—Uncle, I didn't hear any of that, and I won't breathe a word to Auntie, you can cross my heart.
[Character(name="avg_npc_170_1#3", name2="avg_npc_169_1", focus=1)]
[name="Count Vincent"]  And what silly ideas have you gotten! I really ought to make Thomson give you a proper word or three!
