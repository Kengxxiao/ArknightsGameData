[name="Kal'tsit"]  The military needed to light a fire in Sargon, and then wait for war to bring riches their way.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Factories, mines, the arms trade—every second of its existence, Columbia has been gnawing away at this ancient country, strengthening itself.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  So its military pulled a move, brought about the birth of the 'Sand Soldiers,' had them bring scientific researchers into Sargon... to carry out some 'tech support.'
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  —But the Bureau doesn't take things that way at all.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  To be precise, it's the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Arts Units and Originium and its background desires that don't take things that way.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Perhaps Sargon is a backwards, rotting country to some people's eyes, but its ancient wealth and power still suffices to command servitude of all the dust in its sky, to become the desert under the Empire's gaze.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I have to say, the Bureau's viewpoint is correct.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  One portion of Columbia's people has grown narrow-minded with its ballooning riches and power. They mistakenly think they can cause wanton strife in Sargon without paying a price.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Any one Padishah's maneuvering is enough to influence those Columbian entrepreneurs' stock prices, yet they turn a blind eye to Sargon's vast might.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The policymakers are free to be ignorant, and failure in judgment won't harm their core interests, but you yourselves need to know just what it is you're doing.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  At least, you should know, this and your life or death are symbiotic.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  The Padishahs are the Sargon Empire's chief governors at the core, there to control their lords ameer. Would they... have anything to do with the company?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You know what it is the company wants, correct?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Certain high-ranking members of the military have seized some of Blaine Formative Technologies' principal shareholders, exporting these things to Sargon under unofficial cover in order to fulfill a deal with a lord ameer.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And what they truly desire is to employ these simple, crude methods to set off a power struggle within Ibut. Because that will turn profit.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But the Bureau believes that if the war spreads to the heart of the empire, every 'moneymaking' design will become fly ash.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  So, the Bureau wants us to retrieve the target, so as to stop the military brass from going a step too far. That I get, but—
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But the military's not stupid. Its spies within the company—perhaps you've already guessed who—have bribed the Stouthammer Squad to ensure the plans will remain in Sargon, and then a certain lord ameer can set off war.

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The company never cared about what ultimately ended up in whose hands. Regardless of which of you survived to complete the mission, they'd still pocket a reward.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  To be precise, even if you all died right here, it wouldn't affect a single coin that falls into their pockets.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Because the ever-eyeing lords ameer and the Padishahs would've helped you settle and follow up on things otherwise, it's only natural they brought in the chaos.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The moment you were first drawn into Sargon by that enormous reward, you were already cornered.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  ......
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  Sorry, Adviser.
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  You warned us out of the kindness of your heart, and you gave our op everything you had too. I respect you a hell of a lot more than I do those cigar munchers, all making up absolute shit at their meeting tables.
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  But maybe... we still have one other option. Right now, pull out your arms, Adviser. I hope this decisive battle can preserve some dignity.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Don't lose your head, mercenary. I know you've received secret orders from the Chief of Business, but I also trust you understand that right now, following things to the letter will only cut off your own way out.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  Yeah, you've always given me an omniscient kind of impression...
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  The company sold us out, the Chief of Business sacked us like pawns, the lords ameer, the Padishahs and the Columbian military are all itching to kill us and snatch the goods—
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  —but we're mercs, and that's just morning coffee to us. As long as I can still make bank, I have no shits to give.

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  I'm just the smallest fry in this whole whirlwind of crisis, but whether it's in the Bureau's interest or the military's—whatever. All that shit makes me dizzy—
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  Even the company thinks you shouldn't hang around here any longer, Adviser.
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  This is a good chance. A good chance to make a senior adviser in Sargon disappear. Some folks paid me a lot of money—heh, and I couldn't say if they were the same who bribed the Stouthammers.
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  But none of that matters. I just wanna ask you one last thing... You... You've done so much. What was it all for, in the end?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1#3", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Columbia, Sargon, and perhaps Victoria as well. Uncountable powers all wrapped up in this. And though their lack of foresight led us here, all their innumerable machinations point towards one endgame.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1#3", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=2)]
[name="Riverblade Squad Mercenary Captain"]  —War.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1#3", name2="avg_npc_008", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And war will bring ruin.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Who would trust sixteen mercenaries forced to hole up in a cave, a scientist's boy assistant and a mercenary company's operations adviser? Who would willingly sit down with them to discuss where millions of lives are headed?
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I'll give you one final heads-up. Even if you make the Chief of Business happy, and make an obstructive adviser vanish in the middle of Sargon, it will not mean you can return home safe.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Every hired hand in these yellow dusts believes you've made off with the final legacy of the 'Sand Soldiers'... and they will make the choice to exterminate a flock of Columbians who offended their lord ameer's graces.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  Precisely the opposite. If you truly keep working with me, you will only add to the dangers you face.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  But at the least, I can plot a route for you, and help you stow away into Minos. This is the safest path.
