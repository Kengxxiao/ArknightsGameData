[name="Kal'tsit"]  An abandoned courtyard... Is this where you live?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=2)]
[name="Old Isin"]  A few years ago, a merchant built the magnificent courtyard before you, but he disappeared without a trace during a business trip. To this day, no one knows whether he met his fate in a natural Catastrophe or man-made tragedy.
[name="Old Isin"]  But whichever the case, this courtyard has become a place of refuge for those of us with nowhere to go.

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=2)]
[name="Old Isin"]  (Sargonian) 'The Sleeping Sargon.' That's what all those without a home have come to call this place...
[name="Old Isin"]  Just like our fallen homeland, my lady. We sleep on the most extravagant corpse you can find in the whole world.
[name="Old Isin"]  Please stay the night and wait until sunrise. Only then can we leave for the heart of Reefsteep.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The land encircled by reefs.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=2)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Precisely... Right in the center of the sea of sands.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  The padishah and lord ameer chose to rebuild their city somewhere with far richer resources, leaving it a forgotten ruin, a land of lawlessness.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Be that as it may, to those who once lived in that city as well as their descendants, leaving that place behind is easier said than done.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=2)]
[name="Old Isin"]  You can hire underground Messengers to do your bidding there. They will create fake identities for you and help you leave Sargon territory.
[name="Old Isin"]  However, your destination is quite some distance away. Old Isin cannot guarantee you will arrive in one piece.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I thought you'd have met plenty of people like him. Civil unrests and skirmishes happen often in Sargon, after all.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=2)]
[name="Old Isin"]  The world may think there are many brave men with a lust for revenge, but there isn't. Most merely drown in their hatred, their rationality quashed by their anger.

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Why 22 years?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn07_1", name2="avg_npc_173", focus=2)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Arts cannot give us so-called prophecies, and no mere mortal can manipulate time. Time is the mother of all fates. All Old Isin likes to do is to wager against time.

[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_171_1", focus=1)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_173")]
[name="Old Isin"]  In those dreams, there stands a magnificent city among the golden sands. The city moves, and the sky seen from its towers is purer and clearer than ever...
[name="Old Isin"]  The young pasha stands next to Old Isin, and there is always a vast, empty swath of land before our eyes. The young padishah would always begin to recount to Old Isin...
[name="Old Isin"]  Yet Old Isin is too old... Old Isin forgets. Old Isin's crimes are unforgivable.
[Character(name="avg_npc_171_1#2")]
[name="Elliot"]  (He's talking to himself again...)
[Character(name="avg_npc_173")]
[name="Old Isin"]  Old Isin has always sought this answer. Old Isin has been waiting for someone who knows of the city and its glory.
[name="Old Isin"]  All those who had to do with the city yet live in the dream. Some have forgotten, but a great many of us still look back fondly on our homeland...
[name="Old Isin"]  We built this city with our own hands under the padishah's leadership. A great city. Even if Catastrophes bring it to its ruins, that city is the true beginning of the Land of Reefsteep...
[name="Old Isin"]  The Sargonians of Ibut must never forget anything about Reefsteep... yet... Old Isin has forgotten... Old Isin is unforgivable.
