[name="Black Market Merchant"]  Hey, you lot! Use him however you want. He's apparently one of those bookworm types from Columbia, even younger than your kids!
[name="Black Market Merchant"]  Just treat him like those slaves that got sold to us. As long as it doesn't kill him, that is. It's not like he's got a guardian angel watching his back.

[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_171_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  You're exaggerating. It doesn't matter how pretty it is; it's just consumables.

[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Old Isin heard from the fence today... The 'Sand Soldier' is the next ruler of Reefsteep.
[name="Old Isin"]  Do you think you are? Elliot?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  And do you wish me to be, Isin?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  I'm not one to forget the kindness others have shown me. If it wasn't for you, I would not have survived these past two decades.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Now you need Old Isin no more...
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  No... Hardly. We have a special relationship, after all.
[name="Elliot"]  But if you wanted to complain, perhaps you should complain to that lady who cloaked herself in all those mysteries.

[name="Old Isin"]  Kal'tsit...
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  You still remember her name. You've gotten less and less clear-headed over the years. I thought you'd have forgotten that, among many other things.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Have you looked for her?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Elliot"]  Yes, I have, but my attempts have been futile. Not even my most elite intelligence agents could find any information about her in Columbia. Besides, the PMC disbanded not long after that.
[name="Elliot"]  The laboratory was taken over by the military, and all of their data were destroyed. I could not find even a single participant... Columbia hid them well.

[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  The Ibuti Lord Ameer will pass through Redhorn next week. Hoh, fate can be a fickle mistress sometimes.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  This is an excellent opportunity—Old Isin, are you asleep?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  ......
[name="Old Isin"]  Old Isin had a dream...
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Another one of your dreams?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  It was still the same dream as always... The Kheshig's footsteps went across the tundra and grasslands, at last reaching the land of golden sands.
[name="Old Isin"]  But, this time, the dream was a little different...
[name="Old Isin"]  It was a scenery that the padishah never recounted to Old Isin... There was someone there... She looked like... like Kal'tsit... in another form.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Hm.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  She was there.
[name="Old Isin"]  When the Kheshigs' conquest shattered that bygone era all those thousands of years ago... she was there...
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Dreams can't explain much, and there are no Arts that allow us to glimpse into our fate across time. You said so yourself.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Yes... This is merely a dream that Old Isin had... a meaningless dream... Lady Kal'tsit could not have had anything to do with them... but it does make Old Isin wonder if there is meaning to this dream.
[name="Old Isin"]  At the very end, Old Isin saw the padishah.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Oh? And what did your master tell you this time, old faithful?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  He...
[name="Old Isin"]  In my dream... he told Old Isin... where Sargon is...
[name="Old Isin"]  ......
[name="Old Isin"]  You are planning to ambush the lord ameer's squadron.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Yes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  So you mean to tell me that you, a former faithful aide to a Sargon noble, will stop me from disrespecting a lord ameer so?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  —Disrespect?
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Hm.
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  They are rotten and incompetent. They only know to bootlessly harm their kin and drag innocent Sargonians into war...
[name="Old Isin"]  They stand on Reefsteep's land, doing their dirty work. Why would Old Isin feel respect for men like them?
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Old Isin"]  Old Isin wants them to pay the price. Old Isin wants the glory of Sargon's past be restored, and not by these good-for-nothing clowns!
[name="Old Isin"]  Old Isin... Right... Old Isin must seek the city of golden sands!
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I don't see you get this excited often. Please, calm down—
[Character(name="avg_npc_173", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Old Isin"]  It's time...
[name="Old Isin"]  Go, my child. Light a fire, and complete your revenge.
[name="Old Isin"]  Until the time comes when the winds finally calm and the eternal city rises from the sandstorm... Old Isin will wait... and Old Isin will reach that place...

[name="Passenger"]  He's lost to the golden sands... It happened one moonlit night three years ago.
[name="Passenger"]  Time. Time can put to rest even a Savra like him. I almost thought him to be one of the ancient, elder beings in folk tales and conspiracy theories.
[name="Passenger"]  Time has warped me so much, transforming me into a man my past self would have hated.
[name="Passenger"]  And you, Kal'tsit?
[name="Passenger"]  It looks like... nothing about you has changed.

[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_472_pasngr_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Passenger"]  Exactly what I expected our 'Operations Adviser' to say.
[name="Passenger"]  Kal'tsit, you pointed Old Isin to a new direction, and for that he was forever grateful up until the moment he set out on his journey again.
[name="Passenger"]  I cannot begin to imagine the glory you two shared, but now that my business in Sargon has been taken care of, there is nothing that binds me to this world anymore...
[name="Passenger"]  I suppose you will point me in a new direction as well?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_472_pasngr_n_1", focus=1)]

[name="Passenger"]  A Rhodes Island commander? You... Hoh... There is someone whom you trust so deeply here? I look forward to meeting this person, then.
[name="Passenger"]  Kal'tsit...
[name="Passenger"]  You wandered the world for so long. How long will you stay here this time?

[name="Passenger"]  Very well, of course. You needn't answer if you don't want to, as you are now my superior.
[name="Passenger"]  But if this is yet another false identity, and this place where you belong is yet again false, then I am afraid it would hardly be meaningful for me to serve this place.
[name="Passenger"]  How am I to tell you are not using me yet again?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_472_pasngr_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  You have the right to be suspicious...
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_472_pasngr_n_1", focus=2)]
[name="Passenger"]  I need only a little assurance. Will this 'Kal'tsit' who invited me here disappear all of a sudden in a few days, a few months, or perhaps a few years?
[name="Passenger"]  Will she again set off on a journey to take care of some business that a bystander could never come to understand, to drift the world for her own purposes?
[name="Passenger"]  Will you?
[Character(name="char_003_kalts_1", name2="char_472_pasngr_n_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  If a simple answer can affect your loyalty to Rhodes Island, then perhaps I must reevaluate this working relationship of ours.

[name="Passenger"]  I only need an answer. An answer should not be so hard for you. I'll even accept a lie.
