[name="Heavyrain"]  You want to come with...?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain")]
[name="Heavyrain"]  You should know that you are just another suspicious character to us.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Have you inspected your teammates yet?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Heavyrain?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  Everything's normal there...
[name="Heavyrain"]  But I don't trust you.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Yes, very well said. Of course I am not to be trusted.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  What exactly is your objective?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  My objective... is to find out what my objective actually is.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  What the actual—
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Did you know that the last Lord Ameer of Ibut died in a fire?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  That was a few years ago... The current Lord Ameer is his son, and that whole thing caused quite a ruckus in Ibut.
[name="Sesa"]  I had to find myself a new fairy godmother right away thanks to that fire. Took me months to get used to the work there. Huge pain in the butt.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Right, exactly. He was my very last prey.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I did all the preparations and laid out my trap, but there's no more prey to hunt. I have nothing to do except to lounge around.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#3", focus=2)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]

[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#2", name2="avg_npc_172_1#3", focus=1)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.3, xstrength=30, ystrength=30, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  —Y-You killed a Lord Ameer?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  The Sargon army will find you—
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[CameraShake(duration=0.5, xstrength=15, ystrength=15, vibrato=20, randomness=70, fadeout=true, block=false)]
[name="Sesa"]  —Wait, hold on, what do you even want, telling us about this?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Ah, I shouldn't have expected any less from one who frequents the black markets. That's right, there is no one who knows I have to do with his death aside from you and me.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  As for the Sargon army... We live in different times now. The ruling Padishahs simply care not about what is happening here in this barren wasteland.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  My guess is that it matters not to them whether it's the father or the son that's in charge. Actually, to tell the truth, it hardly matters to me either.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I sought his death and nothing else. It was a rather simple request.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  What are you after anyway?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Revenge.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I'm afraid it's a rather boring answer, so I don't like to share it. If I have to venture a guess, more than half of the men in this world would like to take revenge against something, be it their enemies, a city, or even the world itself.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  For the past twenty years, that is all I have been doing.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  My power, my status, my riches... All of them come second, and should the need arise, I will cast them all aside.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Or perhaps I could give them to this 'Rhodes Island.'
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  It's quite the bargain, wouldn't you agree?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  ......
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#4", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Hoh, looks like you are still not convinced, young lady. You are quite cautious. I suppose you were a soldier? From Sargon, perhaps?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  —None of your business.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#2")]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  What about you, young 'Bridge?' Or should I call you by the name you go by now, 'Sesa?'
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#2", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  ......
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  Sesa, we can't trust him.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  You're hiding something pretty important, aren't you now?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Hmm?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#6", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Oh... Yes. Right, how forgetful of me...
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  You claim to be a medical corporation that treats the Infected... Very well, it's a fairly tall tale, but I will accept it for the moment.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I am an Infected.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  My fortunes are no less impressive than the Lord Ameers' riches, and I am well-connected and hold some sway, enough for me to bring a Lord Ameer to his downfall.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I will trade all of it for a chance to be cured. What do you say?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#2", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  —You're mad.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#2", name2="avg_npc_172_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I find myself thinking the same quite often.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  But there is not a single person who walks these lands and wishes not to live. Is it not reasonable of me to want to cast all this aside just for a chance to be cured?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Nah, I don't think that's what Heavyrain's trying to say.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  You don't even seem to care that you're Infected...
[name="Sesa"]  What is it that you want at Rhodes Island?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#6", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Very well. There isn't much time left, so let us stop beating around the bush.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I'm looking for 'Kal'tsit.'
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Perhaps she will impart on me some invaluable advice, perhaps she will show me a new way forward... Yet it's even more likely that she won't lift a finger, merely passing the decision back to me.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  That too is fine.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Once I eliminate every last person involved in that incident years ago, there will be nothing more tying me to this place. I am beyond anxious to leave this forsaken land behind.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I need a fresh start.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  And who could blame me for seizing the opportunity if the shadows of the past so happen to be standing right there?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  What's your relationship with Dr. Kal'tsit?
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=2)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Hmm... It's a long story.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I owe her my life. I'm very thankful to her. This I say from the bottom of my heart.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  The decision isn't ours to make...
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Three years ago... the Lord Ameer of Ibut perished in a fire during his travels. The fire consumed an entire town, and, soon after, his son set off a rebellion, vying for the throne against his many other contenders.
[name="Sesa"]  That's your doing, eh?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Precisely, just as I said.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#4", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  All trivial matters of a bygone era. The family had a tragic, rocky relationship to start. I only played a very minor role.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Why do you want to know?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  I'm looking for clues... Thanks to you, I gotta call it quits with my investigation in the Ibut region.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Ah... clues.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Perhaps this is an opportunity for me to earn your trust. Tell me what it is you are looking for. Perhaps I will be of assistance.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  I'm looking for someone. The director of a Columbian military experiment.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  You are investigating a Columbian company. May I ask why?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Because the person I respected the most died in the most laughable accident ever...
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  And what if it was actually an accident?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Even if it was just an accident... I gotta know the truth. I mean, this couldn't have been the reason those guys rose through the ranks on top of my brother's death.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  Sesa...
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  I know. It's my own personal issue... but this chance doesn't come often. Don't you agree, 'Sand Soldier'?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Heh... Ahem, pardon me.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Where was I?
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Everyone needs a revenge of some kind. Targets can be big or small, and grudges can run deep or shallow, but revenge is an eternal motif to every living person out there.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  If you permit me to undergo treatment at Rhodes Island, I can investigate this matter for you. Of course, the deals we talked about still stand.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Even if you have ten times the cargo sitting outside, I have a way to take care of it all. There will be no trace left of it, and you will find the price very attractive. It's a bargain for a pharmaceutical company.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  Sesa... Sorry, but we can't let your personal problems be somebody else's bargaining chip.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  Of course I know that... but I...
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Right... I almost forgot. It seems I've been rather forgetful of late.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  I never thought much of Old Isin's prophecy to begin with. However, thinking back, perhaps the prophecy was itself a means of negotiation and communication.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Hmph, prophecy... Mere mortals will never find themselves on equal footing with time itself. Originium Arts may have many convenient uses, but that is one thing you can never achieve with Arts.
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#3", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  A prophecy...?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#3", focus=1)]
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Alas, Old Isin passed away long ago. I only hope that she remembers this promise.
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  Did she perhaps... give you a gold coin?
[name="'Sand Soldier'"]  An old Sargon gold coin.
[Character(name="char_304_hvrain#2", name2="avg_npc_172_1", focus=1)]
[name="Heavyrain"]  ......!

[Character(name="avg_npc_012")]
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Ugh, they're closing in quick. We can still get out of here without a fight if we make a run for it now. Take our time and we won't be so lucky.
[name="Rhodes Island Operator"]  Fifteen minutes. That's all we have. Captain, Lieutenant, hurry.

[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1#3", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=2)]
[name="Sesa"]  You even gave the townspeople the time to evacuate. Did you just want to ruin the town? Redhorn was miles away from your turf. What were you after exactly?
[Character(name="avg_npc_172_1", name2="char_379_sesa_1#5", focus=1)]
