[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1")]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  He certainly isn't a noble... Does he not worry about offending others, acting so tyrannically?
[character]
[name="Elderly Caretaker"]  They say some count's very fond of him... ah, and not just that. Coming here for his 'battlefield condition?' I heard that's hokum. Bet he hasn't stepped foot on a battlefield in his life.
[name="Elderly Caretaker"]  I heard he helped the count do some dirty work, and got sent here so he could keep his head down. With a supporter like that, and with people like us, of course he lets all hell's bells loose.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  'Louisa.' Borrowing your daughter's name. A disguise of that level is purely for humiliating the Secret Police.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  In their eyes, I am already dead. And after this incident, I'll leave Ursus, and may not be able to return for a very long time.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Nobody will know the Grand Duke's death was a murder. The next time they come to the Grand Duke's side, they will only discover that in his old age, his breathing stopped.

[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Empire's progress has already surpassed what I imagined, but these are not details we need to discuss right now.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Lillia, your hoped-for arbitration can only end in this way.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  None of you have the means to seek further revenge; it is unreasonable. Only the paramount Emperor of Ursus would be capable of erasing the Grand Duke's honor, significance, and all else.

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Yes. We have no idea what Grand Duke Vanya is chronically afflicted with.
[name="Lillia"]  But I found out from the head caretaker that every afternoon at three, Vanya will leave his own monitoring room, and come here to relax.
[name="Lillia"]  He sunbathes here until sunset. When he has the occasional guests, he'll have his dinner right here with them.
[name="Lillia"]  There's no way we can get close to the Grand Duke's room, but as for here...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  Yes.
[name="Lillia"]  But he won't be without bodyguards. The whole corridor will be sealed off when the time comes.
[name="Lillia"]  Apart from any guests cleared to be with the Grand Duke, only his medical adviser, as well as the servants, are allowed to enter this area.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even so, the Ursus nobles won't permit the workers to come to this balcony freely.

[name="Lillia"]  Sergei can't offer any further scientific assistance. Perhaps in a few years, they'll formally call a halt to the project. And then? I just sit back and watch Sergei and Boris continue to collude, to trample over everything?

[name="Lillia"]  If you won't speak up, I'll return to Chernobog. I'll settle things once and for all.
[name="Lillia"]  Vampilov's family have an escape route to Sami ready for me, but maybe, I wouldn't get the chance to hitchhike with any Messengers. And you...

[name="Lillia"]  Heh... of course.
[name="Lillia"]  I'm very well aware, I'm setting myself alight. So... Kal'tsit, no matter whether you plan to confess all the facts to me or not, at the very least there's one tiny thing I want you to agree to.
[name="Lillia"]  I know I'm doing something insane right now, and I know maybe you're the one in the right. But right now, I only have one request. Look after my daughter. Look after Louisa.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  The next generation doesn't need to inherit the hassle of hatred... Even if nobody can escape this cycle in the end, at least promise me, Kal'tsit. Look after her. If you can, please look after Lyudmila too...

[name="Lillia"]  Kal'tsit, who is he?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#4", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Viscount Islam Witte.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#2", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  You recognize him...?
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#2", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Ursus's new Minister of Finance, a fresh noble with deep favor from the Emperor.
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#6", focus=2)]
[name="Lillia"]  He...
[Character(name="char_003_kaltsn09_1", name2="avg_npc_168_1#6", focus=1)]
[name="Kal'tsit"]  It's alright, Dr. Louisa.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  I have only surface knowledge of his character, and don't know specifically how he made his fortune. But what I do know is, he's a present pillar who the Emperor of Ursus has personally assisted.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  And young elites like him can only have their sights set on the whole of Ursus. To the waves of crisis crashing against the Empire, the crises of Chernobog are mere tiny ripples.
[name="Kal'tsit"]  Even a Grand Duke of Ursus—

[name="Kal'tsit"]  The Minister of Finance came to Pine Valley, yet has no armed entourage?

[name="Lillia"]  Oh... I don't think so.
