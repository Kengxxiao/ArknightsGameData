Downtown Lungmen, Cafe Al Fresco

[Delay(time=0.4)]
[Character(name="avg_npc_035")]
[name="Yith"]   A pleasant aroma
[name="Yith"]   To enjoy such a lovely al fresco cafe, with a sandwich, by candlelight, as the people go by, with the fragrance of sweet candy,
[name="Yith"]   It would be a truly relaxing experience were it not for this young lady staring daggers into me.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   ...I just happened to be walking by. But that thing you have in your hand isn't the kind of thing that can be explained by happenstance.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=2)]
[name="Yith"]   I have explained. Mostima is acting in her capacity as an employee of Penguin Logistics, and I am helping her guard the staff in her absence.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   You think I'm going to let some freak who talks to her staff off the hook?
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1#3",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=2)]
[name="Yith"]   F- freak...? Let's just pretend you didn't see that.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   ......
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=2)]
[name="Yith"]   She will be fine.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   I'm not worried about her.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=2)]
[name="Yith"]   Nor will she make trouble.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   ...I hope you're right.
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=2)]
[name="Yith"]   ......
[Character(name="char_300_phenxi_1",name2="avg_npc_035",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   ......
[Character(name="avg_npc_035")]
[name="Yith"]   ...... (Perhaps I should just stay in the hotel.)

[name="Mostima"]   Oh, here you are. What was that back there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_034",fadetime=2,block=true)]
[Delay(time=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Just a flight of whimsy.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Your whimsy might have been a little too powerful. You knew Penguin Logistics was there, didn't you?
[name="Mostima"]   And as old as you are, you probably shouldn't exert yourself like that. You're not looking to cut it short, are you?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Just how much of my power do you think I expended?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   ...right.
[name="Mostima"]   Well how about you take your murderous aura down a notch? I've had just about all the ominous energy I can take.
[name="Mostima"]   So what happened?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   I may have underestimated the vigilance of the youth. Lungmen's young people never fail to impress me.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#5",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   It is nothing major, but a few out of control puppets have injured a remarkably dedicated finball master. That is all.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#5",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   'That is all?' I think you need to work on your expressions before you go saying things like that.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   The one who always smiles never truly smiles. Compared to you, I am very relaxed.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Isn't this something you planned for?
[name="Mostima"]   Like, in order to prevent this conflict between Penguin Logistics and the mob from turning sour, you went looking for an excuse to punish them? Something like that?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Look at you, girl. It's such a waste to have you scrounging around with that penguin.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   I'll take that as a compliment.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   ...But I did not permit them to go trampling the slums. I would never permit that.
[name="Rat King"]   I have reached the end of my patience for their constant oversteps, and yet they still continue to disregard the rules.
[name="Rat King"]   I had assumed that if they maintained even a faint connection to Siracusa, they might be of some miniscule, interesting benefit to Lungmen... I am very disappointed.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#4",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Wait a second... why are you telling me all of this? This isn't like a 'reveal your whole plan before killing me to keep your secrets' sort of thing, is it?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#4",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Old people need to complain.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Oh yeah? Then I'll just treat it like a Sauin Carnival. I didn't hear a word you just said.
[name="Mostima"]   The more trouble the mafia stirs up, the bigger the balance I'm due on the other side.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   And after you have that money?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   The first thing I'll do is buy that candy shop.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Heh. You really are attached.
[name="Rat King"]   Fine. Aside from the cellar, everything else is yours.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   There's a cellar...? Can't you try to protect my sweet memories, even a little bit?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   It's my shop.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#4",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   That's too bad. I really thought you'd retire as something more like a grocer.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#4",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Maybe. If I'm still alive by the time I retire.
[name="Rat King"]   Time grows short. The Carnival is about to begin. The players in this show are already in position.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   You're not watching from the sidelines anymore?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#9",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   ...the scenery here is lovely, isn't it?
[name="Rat King"]   Sauin is all about honoring the dead. And Lungmen is our city, after all.
[name="Rat King"]   When the living enjoy their lively carousing, only then may the souls of the dead depart without regret.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#7",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   And if we have a rat with one foot in a coffin, unless it moves, one might mistake it for a deceased soul ready to depart.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#7",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   How are we supposed to do 'lively carousing?'
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Just like this.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Oh... I see.
[name="Mostima"]   Then this Sauin's expenses must be pretty high. Wasteful, even.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Smart girl.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   Otherwise, Chief Wei would've come after you a long time ago.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Let's not speak of such matters. I certainly don't want to talk to the LGD again. So annoying.
[name="Rat King"]   But the key to a good show is when the actors foot the bill themselves.

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#4",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Definitely not. They might be some of those thugs we ran into before. There's too many of them. Don't want to think about it. Just run. We can lose them.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#4",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   But I just saw a guy running at us with a rolling pin...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   That's how these fights usually go. You don't come to the slums often?
[name="Exusiai"]   Sometimes they end up rolling some blood or teeth into the dough, and then a customer gets all pissed off when he bites into somebody else's tooth.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   I really didn't need such a detailed explanation.
[name="Bison"]   ...Have you known Mostima for a long time?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   You're getting pretty friendly with me now.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   Mostima said she was testing me...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Oh? I never heard about that.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   ...I guess I didn't either.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Why do you look up to her so much? It's really different from the way you treat the rest of us.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   She's kind of like... everything I ever hoped to be as a Messenger. She's done everything I ever hoped to do.
[name="Bison"]   ...I really envy her.
[name="Bison"]   Even though I don't really get what's going on in her head.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   That's how it goes. I chased her from Laterano to Lungmen, then I met the boss, and all the way up to today, I still don't know what's going on in her head.
[name="Exusiai"]   I've since given up. It's easier to just wait until she pops up right behind me.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_325_bison_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   Don't be so gloomy... Wait, did you say from Laterano to Lungmen?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Uh huh. You caught that, did you? Don't give me that look. I'm just as good as Mostima. Maybe she's a little bit ahead, but...
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   No, it really doesn't matter to me. We should focus on meeting up with Texas.

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   Oh. Sorry.

[name="Emperor"]   We'll bring some fire beats to Lungmen. They break down in tears, and bow down all nice and tidy.
