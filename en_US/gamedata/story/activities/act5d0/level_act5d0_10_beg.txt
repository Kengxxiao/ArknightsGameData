[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Rat King"]   Penguin Logistics is on its face a legal entity. The only thing that can protect it is the ironclad law of Lungmen.
[name="Rat King"]   But they do, from time to time, cause offense to various stakeholders. And they never take it appropriately seriously.
[name="Rat King"]   But bear in mind, Sicilians, you must never overstep your bounds.
[name="Rat King"]   An unconventional order is not the same as disorder. Siracusans should understand this more than anyone. But you must never again bring trouble to these old bones of mine. Promise me that.
