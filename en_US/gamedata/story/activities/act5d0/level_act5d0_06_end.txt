[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3")]

[name="Emperor"]   But we been on the run for a grand total of five hours today. That's double my normal work day. Double!
[name="Emperor"]   Not to mention we torched a whole year's worth of goodies! Cars, booze, and my precious vinyl!

[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   No, it doesn't. But it makes for a nice excuse to tear myself away from troublesome social interactions.
[name="???"]   Croissant has ordered a new custom accessory for her hammer. Exusiai has sought my help in caring for her beloved gun. In short, there is much to be done.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   I would love to. Socializing over drinks with colleagues is vastly more meaningful than the empty social niceties I've endured.
[name="???"]   But I'm afraid, looking at these movements, it may be a challenge to save The Ends of the Earth.
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   ...So, did you just get in to Lungmen? How much do you know about what's gone on tonight?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   Everything. The threads that make up this year's Carnival are uncomplicated. The tapestry is abundantly clear to me.

[name="Mostima"]   Are you not going to help?
[Character(name="avg_npc_035",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="???"]   I am not. I will leave the physical labor to your youthful vigor, look after your items, enjoy a cup of tea, and wait for the situation to resolve itself.
[name="???"]   Right then. The Rat King is waiting for you. Do please enjoy yourself.
