[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   You wouldn't think it from the stinkin' pile of garbage we're sittin' in, but it was great. Just thinkin' about somebody else footin' the bill for all our expenses makes me all warm inside!
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Sora"]   Texas, if you figured it out earlier, you should have told us.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#3",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   I just guessed.
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1#5",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]

[name="Bison"]   No, I'm okay.
[name="Bison"]   I just, how can I say this? I just feel like I can't accept it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   You get used to it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   If I'm used to it then it's all over.

[name="Bison"]   Mostima, you told me you would be giving me a grade for my performance at Penguin Logistics, didn't you?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I did. I've been thinking about it. And while you didn't exactly mesh with everybody, you made some great strides. That much is clear. Maybe...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   No.
[name="Bison"]   I'm not staying here.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Oh? I thought with everything that happened, you'd need Penguin Logistics to be a springboard for you to bigger and better things.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   That was the original idea. Turns out you had that all figured out...
[name="Bison"]   It's not that I think Penguin Logistics is terrible. Well, it is terrible.
[name="Bison"]   But I think, with Messengers like this, who live like this...
[name="Bison"]   Even though my common sense tells me it's ridiculously dangerous...
[name="Bison"]   I think it might be... what I actually want.
[name="Bison"]   Or maybe it's like I'll start to question reality if I don't look at it this way.
[name="Bison"]   ...like one, completely insane dream.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Yeah. Fistfights, explosions, and high altitude drops will do that to you.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Getting thrown into the deep end with Penguin Logistics isn't great for your mental health.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   But if you've made your decision, and as your fellow Messenger, I wish you luck.

[name="Mostima"]   All right, all right. I'll tell you.
[name="Mostima"]   ...But right not now. You've been digging into it on your own for a while now, so you must understand.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Um, I don't know why, but it's classified as a state secret now. Does that matter?

[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Mostima"]   I give up. Not that anyone could ever tell you what to do.

[Character(name="avg_npc_029#3",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]

[name="Suffering?"]   Which reminds me, you must've made a lot of money this time around? How about sending some my way? A little hospitality?
[name="Mostima"]   We're both from Laterano. Who's the host here?
[name="Suffering?"]   Fine. By the way, this angel's halo is blindingly bright.
[name="Mostima"]   They get in the way sometimes.
[name="Suffering?"]   Lucky you don't have that problem, fallen angel.
[name="Mostima"]   Are you jealous? I could buy you a fluorescent lamp to wear on your head.
[name="Suffering?"]   Sounds like a pain. How do you deal with it?
[name="Mostima"]   Instinct. The moment we start using language, the halo appears.
[name="Suffering?"]   Like the first time you blurt out 'mama' or 'dada?' What a beautiful image.
[name="Mostima"]   Haha. Exusiai's first word was 'sis.' Even though they're not blood related, they still...
[name="Suffering?"]   Enough. Let's not talk about her sister. Even if Laterano doesn't care, it's not a topic for casual conversation.
[name="Suffering?"]   It's because you leveled this precious gun at the captain that you fell.
[name="Suffering?"]   Do you really plan to tell her the whole story someday? The little sister of your beloved battle-sister?
[name="Mostima"]   Hm... You've followed me this long and I still haven't told you. It might be that you, also my 'beloved battle-sister...' have a really bad temper?
[name="Suffering?"]   I'm only under obligation to remind you that you must not speak even one word of what happened at Kazdel.
[name="Mostima"]   But what about my travel memoir?
[name="Suffering?"]   Sounds great. Hey, why don't you go get your staff back from that freaky guy before I write you up for it.
