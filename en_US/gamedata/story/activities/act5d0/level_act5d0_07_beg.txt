[name="Mafioso"]   Boss, Penguin Logistics is on the move.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Of course. I just gave her a few skin deep cuts...
[name="Gambino"]   But I'm more worried about Capone.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#2",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   Y- yeah, we haven't been able to reach him. Tried real hard an hour ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Where's the last place you got him? The slums?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#3",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   Er, yeah.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   That's too bad.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   What do you mean?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Tell all the crews, we're going with the original plan to get Penguin Logistics...
[name="Gambino"]   But I'm thinkin'... unless something goes wrong, we'll get two or three crews dropping off the grid.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   What do you mean... boss?
[name="Mafioso"]   Couldn't be... Capone betrayed the Family?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   I get where he's comin' from. All too well.
[name="Gambino"]   We grew up together. And dad had us deal with a traitor, with our own two hands. That was my first time takin' a life. Our first time takin' a life.
[name="Gambino"]   The Siracusa fiasco changed us. The only difference is he turned weak, and I chose the clear path.
[name="Gambino"]   He's gonna sell out the Family. Or I guess he wants to give the Family a new name.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso"]   So what should we do about it?
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Penguin Logistics is turning out trickier than I thought. And we can't fight a war on too many fronts.
[name="Gambino"]   I'm thinkin' we deal with our traitor problem first.

[name="Mafioso B"]   If we kept to Mr. Capone's plan from the start, we wouldn't be in this mess.
[name="Mafioso B"]   We've been over this with the Rat King. Why do we gotta kill anybody? This ain't Siracusa!

[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]
[name="Capone"]   Hmph. Seven years ago, when we buried the old boss, you sent me here, to Lungmen.
[name="Capone"]   I came halfway across the world to set up a business that could support the Family, like a backstop.
[name="Capone"]   But then you had to go and screw up in Siracusa. And what do you do? You hop on over here and take over everything I broke my back to build.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Come on, you ain't gettin' pissed off over some little shit like this. Or you'd've been dead a long time ago.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=2)]

[Character(name="avg_npc_028#4",name2="avg_npc_027#2",focus=1)]

[name="Capone"]   If you keep runnin' around Lungmen makin' noise like you do, sooner or later the powers that be are gonna get sick of it and wipe us out.
[Character(name="avg_npc_028#4",name2="avg_npc_027#4",focus=1)]
[name="Gambino"]   Your deep and heartfelt concern for the Family is moving me to tears, dear Capone.
