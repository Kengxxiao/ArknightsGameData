[name="Jaye"]   Your finballs.
[Character(name="avg_npc_032")]
[name="Female Tourist"]   Oooh, such springy mouthfeel. Pretty good.
[name="Female Tourist"]   This place definitely earned that recommendation in the Great Foodie Guide!
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1#3")]
[name="Jaye"]   Glad you like it.

[Character(name="avg_npc_032",name2="avg_npc_033",focus=1)]
[name="Female Tourist"]   I know what you mean. Like, you're selling finballs, why do you have a big knife on the counter there?
[Character(name="avg_npc_032",name2="avg_npc_033",focus=2)]
[name="Male Tourist"]   The Foodie Guide says the owner is an old man called 'The Godly Finball Uncle.'
[name="Male Tourist"]   He couldn't be some kind of triad or something...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1")]
[name="Jaye"]   Hm? Did you want something else?

[name="Waai Fu"]   And this is what you wear to work? Think about how this makes Uncle Tung look.

[name="Jaye"]   Welcome back. Done with work?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   You could say that. The office said you took some credit. How much?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   32.60, rounded. You want to try one?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Where'd that come from? I don't have any change on me.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   Consider it a token of my appreciation for doing so much to look after my business.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   All right. Don't mind if I do.
[name="Waai Fu"]   Hmm...
[name="Waai Fu"]   It's tasty and all, but isn't this Uncle Tung's stall? A tribute made with borrowed goods is one without meaning.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   You always have to get your digs in. This one's on me...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Okay then. You've definitely gotten better. I wish the other punks took things as seriously as you do.

[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   Must be some Sauin makeup or something.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]

[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Studying. I've got a test in two days.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   You're spending Sauin studying?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Sauin is supposed to be about shepherding spirits into the afterlife. Our society has totally corrupted it with consumerism. Respectfully, I will abstain.
[name="Waai Fu"]   Not to mention, I don't get paid that much. I need to get my grades up and nab a scholarship.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   Yeah, that sounds about right for you...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   It's their fault for being so out of touch. Don't lump me in with them.
