[name="Bison"]   By the way, you didn't happen to see a Sankta lady around here, did you?
[Character]
[name="Stranger"]   I didn't see anything. And I don't have time for this. These sweets are for the after party and are you gonna pay me if they turn up late... Oh?

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Not really. As long as we go down to the station once a month to pay our property damage fines, they pretty much let us do whatever too.

[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#3")]

[Character(name="char_101_sora_1")]

[name="Exusiai"]   Huh? Do I have something on my face?
[Character(name="char_101_sora_1")]

[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   First we get some more answers from our little buddy, then we formulate an appropriate... response.

[name="Bison"]   Wait, Exusiai, do you mean...
[name="Bison"]   I actually ran into Mostima back there. But then I lost her.
[name="Bison"]   Erm, I mean, after we shook the mobsters, she——
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   ...don't worry about her. That's just how she is. Vanishing years at a time.

[name="Bison"]   ...years?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#2")]

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   This is all very... unorthodox.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
