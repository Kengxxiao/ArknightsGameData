[name="Butler"]   Please wait here a moment,
[name="Butler"]   Mr. Rat King.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Thank you very much. You are dismissed.
[name="Rat King"]   And excellent marksmanship back there, by the way.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   The praise is much appreciated. And do forgive my rudeness, but you were not injured at all, were you?
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Of course not. However, if you ever had any genuine murderous intent towards me...
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#3",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   Then I never would have had a chance to pull the trigger. You need not be so humble, sir, the Master of the House and myself are well acquainted with your past.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#3",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Ah, time is a cruel mistress. Tonight once again reminded me of that fact.
[name="Rat King"]   When one toys with the power to terrify others, one risks seeing himself swallowed whole. Playing with those children full of piss and vinegar saw my precious coat destroyed.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   Only your coat?
[Character(name="avg_npc_029",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Needlework is awfully difficult for me.
[name="Rat King"]   You have completed your task, Messenger. Return to your master, let him feel at ease that his thing is done.
[Character(name="avg_npc_029#2",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Butler"]   Indeed. But the Master of the House may well want to see you in person. For now, I shall take my leave.

[name="Rat King"]   Would you like a drink?

[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1")]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   A bottle that the Rat King himself deigned to bend over and pick up? How could I refuse?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Listen to you, Chief Wei.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Chief. It's been a long time since I heard you call me that.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   And here you are, participating in this little game yourself. I thought you would just pawn it off on Penguin Logistics...
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   An old man should look like an old man, be kind, and join in fun with the children.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Heh heh. I still don't feel like you're truly aging. Maybe it's because your daughter looks more and more like you every day. The young you.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   I don't know how far she can go. Sometimes we need to let them go, but I think we haven't done a very good job on that front.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Even if they choose a dead end?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Even if they choose a dead end.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Hah. But then, what path truly takes you that far? And who decides? The Catastrophes?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   ...Maybe you really have gotten old, Lin.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   You know why I pay so much attention to that little Messenger? It's because I think they may have something in common.
[name="Rat King"]   ...Now that I think of it, maybe you shouldn't be here in person, Chief.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   There are some 'Lungmen citizens' who are 'casually passing by,' we are well aware.
[Character(name="avg_npc_034")]
[name="Rat King"]   *Sigh*
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Even the Rat King sighs.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   There are many things that merit a sigh. I just happened to pick one, with gusto.
[name="Rat King"]   ...Maybe it is time to retire.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   That's no good. Lungmen still needs her Rat King.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   But she can do without Lin. Neither of us are as we once were.
[name="Rat King"]   No matter. I will persevere until the day Lungmen is ready to go without the Rat King.
[name="Rat King"]   That'll be the day my daughter is truly grown.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Is that what you think?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   I am her father. And the Rat King of the slums. And once, I was your friend, Lin Gray.
[name="Rat King"]   Maybe I can't make a decision. Maybe I've already made many mistakes.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   ...You are still brooding over the past, Lin.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   When you took Lungmen back for us, I promised you I would stay in the shadow of Wei Yenwu. You need not ever again touch these filthy old alleyways.
[name="Rat King"]   ...Yes. It's been so long. I made that promise, and we have a Rat King.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   You've sacrificed much.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Spare us the crocodile tears. As if I was innocent? When were we ever innocent?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   ...You kept your promise, old friend. But you also did not hide your misery.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Is that because of your daughter?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   I could not make it clearer to you why I would use such a roundabout way of expelling those Siracusans.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   There are many troublesome foes. At least I can trust you.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Trust and exploitation are of a kind. Each have a time and place. We must be practical.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   ...You used to hate this kind of talk.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   It's remarkable. We have had so many long-awaited reunions tonight, and yet not a single one has been satisfying.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Don't talk like that. Look, we're two old friends enjoying some scintillating conversation just after Sauin. Let's just relax.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   As you wish. Phew, it's gotten cold. I don't suppose you had time to light a candle for our old comrades in arms?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   That doesn't take much time at all. As soon as you left, there I was.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   ...I just can't imagine Wei Yenwu bringing flowers to a grave all by his lonesome.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   I won't attend your funeral, but maybe I'll bring a bouquet to your grave. Then you'll know.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   ...Could you recall a person who saved your life, and for the trouble was never again able to walk?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   There are more such people than we could count. The ones who fought side by side with us, gave their lives for us.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   And I will never forget any of them, even for a second.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   ...Your eyes never change. Maybe, just maybe you will live a long time.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   There's a trick to these things.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Either way, you have to live a while longer.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   I'll take that as a Sauin blessing.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]   It was an eventful evening, Mr. Eurill. There were some twists and turns, but everyone got what they needed.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   I thought you'd be waiting in the VIP room for everything to resolve itself comfortably.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_030",focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]   To toss my son into imminent danger while I wait warm and comfy in the VIP room for Chief Wei to report back? Does that sound like me?

[Character(name="avg_npc_030")]
[name="Eurill"]   Now now. Chief Wei is present. Let's clear the air of this murderous energy.
[name="Eurill"]   In any case, the evening's total economic damages don't come anywhere near those of a single Catastrophe, so where's the problem?
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Penguin Logistics is a fine place to cut your teeth. All those young ladies, the so-called Messengers, certainly don't make an easy go of it.
[name="Rat King"]   But if I might offer one piece of advice: be careful it doesn't backfire.
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=1)]
[name="Eurill"]   Hah, of course! But this is my son we're talking about! Mountain Dash never backs down from a challenge!
[Character(name="avg_npc_034#3")]
[name="Emperor"]   You got Mostima, and all of Lungmen really, playin' tutor to your boy. You got me and this ol' stank-ass rodent as your tools. Can you really afford all this?

[name="Rat King"]   Tools? Nonsense.
[name="Rat King"]   I couldn't have foreseen those Siracusans would be so difficult to reason with. I thought they'd work with me after a good rapping on the knuckles.

[name="Wei Yenwu"]   ...Heh. How lively.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   From time to time, you take a deep breath in the outskirts and the air has a very particular taste to it.
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   As for the Siracusans, no matter how wild the game got, your particular hand was always going to see it turn into something great.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   It won't always be so. You know this better than I. But they have yet to contend with Wei Yenwu.
[name="Rat King"]   You may want to be mindful of Siracusa's movements.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Of course.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   It's too bad. The crusty old mouse couldn't bring you the goods, Wei Yenwu.
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Eurill"]   ...Mr. Emperor, such words could hurt one's feelings.
[name="Eurill"]   Now, for the offense caused to the Rat King, planned though it was, I do offer my deepest apologies.
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   Your man is a very impressive shot, or at least, he's good at portraying one. It makes a man wonder about his background.
[Character(name="char_105_emper",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=1)]
[name="Emperor"]   Real sad. Coulda been a lot more realistic.
[Character(name="char_105_emper",name2="avg_npc_034",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   ...You really just want to see the whole world burn.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_030",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Mr. Eurill, in consideration of the cooperation agreement between Lungmen and your company, it would be wise for you to keep your son away from the center, for the time being.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_030",focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]   Hah hah hah! Compared to the potential value of this little venture, that's no trouble at all.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_030",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   And Mr. Emperor, I trust you understand why it is Lungmen has always turned a blind eye toward the activities of Penguin Logistics.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Are you telling me it's not because of my outstanding business acumen and immense personal charisma?
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   ...Eheh. Indeed. And I believe you see it clearer than anyone.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   *Yawn* Leave me out of it the next time you wanna do something like this! I'ma send you all an invoice and a bill or two. And you can be sure they're comin' with lots of zeroes.
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Eurill"]   Ahahahaha! That's our Emperor. He never misses a chance to extort a dollar. Maybe I should take a page from his book.
[Character(name="char_105_emper",name2="avg_npc_034#3",focus=2)]
[name="Rat King"]   There are few who would dare to extort the whole of Lungmen. That book is a tough read.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_030",focus=2)]
[name="Eurill"]   Now then, Chief Wei.
[Character(name="char_2005_weiyw_1",name2="avg_npc_030",focus=1)]
[name="Wei Yenwu"]   Yes, it's probably time for a change of venue. Everyone has their own business to attend to.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Huh? You plannin' another elaborate, multi-layered plot with six traps, eight twists, and four turns?
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Eurill"]   Would you care to invest? Together, we could move the logistics industry up to a new level. From Lungmen, we could take on all Terra!
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Nah. Honestly, I think your company's branding is as crusty as that old rat.
[Character(name="avg_npc_030",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Eurill"]   Ahahahaha! That's the reason! How regrettable!
