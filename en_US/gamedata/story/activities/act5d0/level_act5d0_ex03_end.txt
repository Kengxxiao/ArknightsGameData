[name="???"]   So this time, he got a hole in his belly? Done in by that cool-looking old guy?
[name="???"]   That's right. I was in the front row. I saw the whole thing.
[name="???"]   What do you think it was? A body double? Special effects?
[name="???"]   No way. Couldn't be. Check out this video of it, you'll see...
[name="???"]   Woah. It's way too realistic!
[name="???"]   So was it Emperor's body double? 
[name="???"]   What about last time? I remember when he was out shopping, some thugs ran up on him with a crossbow and got him right in the brain...
[name="???"]   You can't rehearse that ahead of time.
[name="???"]   And there was that time in Siesta, during the music festival. Lots of people after him there.
[name="???"]   I was there too, and I went out of my way to book a hotel right near by for a shot at seeing him. It was real exciting.
[name="???"]   ...Isn't he a musician? I mean, he's got a bit of money, but how does he get this many people hating him?
[name="???"]   You don't know how he is. I'll say up front, I really like the guy. But when it comes to making enemies, he's got to be one of Terra's greatest experts.
[name="???"]   I heard there was some kind of accident at a Penguin Logistics warehouse last night. He came running out of the flames, completely unharmed.
[name="???"]   A while back, somebody saw him get hit dead on by like a grenade or explosive or something in the slums. He showed up totally fine in an underground bar the next day.
[name="???"]   That's nothing.
[name="???"]   Huh? His brains got blown out by an explosive shell.
[name="???"]   ...You're sure it was an explosive?
[name="???"]   Speaking of which, during the most chaotic times in the history of Columbia's music industry it's said that he got taken out in a drive-by shooting, sparking a huge controversy.
[name="???"]   Didn't he get poisoned?
[name="???"]   Oh! I was on a trip to Columbia at the time... I thought I'd never get to see my idol ever again.
[name="???"]   But he lived?
[name="???"]   He lives, and he still goes to fight on his own. He says it's to avenge those kids.
[name="???"]   So? He can't die?
[name="???"]   It's got to be some fake news, right? You can't believe everything the media says.
[name="???"]   But boy is he hard to kill.
[name="???"]   I don't know. Maybe we should just tie him down in a crater and let a Catastrophe deal with him.
[name="???"]   ...Why do I get the feeling he'd survive that one too?
[name="???"]   ...Yeah, I can imagine him bursting out of the volcanic eruption, spewing curse words at it all the way.
[name="???"]   And they'd rhyme.
[name="???"]   ......
[name="???"]   ...Never mind.
[name="???"]   Afterall he is the one and only Emperor, am I right?
