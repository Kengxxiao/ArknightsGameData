[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   I'd love to. It's been a while since I had a trip to Lungmen. But a job's a job...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   Considering how I found you, I'm guessing your deal with Penguin Logistics isn't going so well?

[name="Bison"]   ...you could say that.

[name="Mafioso A"]   Can we really just yoink him in the middle of downtown Lungmen?
[Character(name="avg_npc_031",name2="avg_npc_031",focus=2)]
[name="Mafioso B"]   Mr. Capone says as long as we do it nice and quiet-like, hold off on the guns and bombs, Lungmen won't make a fuss.
[name="Mafioso B"]   Nobody's gonna go looking in those filthy old alleyways, eh?

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="???"]   I guess I better introduce myself. I'm Mostima. A Messenger for Penguin Logistics.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I think that makes me your colleague, for now. I usually work alone though.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...Mostima. I've heard that name from my father before.
[name="Bison"]   (Not to mention a Sankta with black horns... the rumors were true. Better not ask about them though...)

[name="Bison"]   Erm... how should I say...? Just baseless rumors...
[name="Bison"]   And after you saved me like that, I have no reason to doubt you. Sorry.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Don't worry about it. You got nothing to apologize for.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Thanks... Now we should share our intelligence... although I'm still pretty confused.
[name="Bison"]   Basically, Penguin Logistics is in some kind of conflict with an arm of the Siracusan mafia.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Right. Got it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Huh? You got it already?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   I don't need any more. You need to stop thinking so much. Trust your instincts. That's the Penguin Logistics way.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Oh. So the trick is to just stop thinking, huh...?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   They're a very special bunch. Common sense doesn't really work here.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...What about you, Mostima?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Are you always this direct with people?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   I- I think so.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
