[Character(name="char_325_bison_1")]
[name="Bison"]   So this is where Penguin Logistics holes up...
[name="Bison"]   (It's like a disaster area. And so dark.)
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_325_bison_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   It's one of our bases. We haven't cleaned up in a while. Just sit wherever.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   Oh, thanks... I realize I didn't properly thank you, any of you.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_325_bison_1",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   We did our jobs. You should introduce yourself first.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#3")]
[name="Bison"]   I'm a Messenger, codenamed Bison. I'm from Lungmen, and I work for Mountain Dash Logistics. My father sent me to learn what I can from your company. And I appreciate the opportunity.
[name="Bison"]   Now about the contract between me and Mr. Emperor, I know we've already been over it, but...
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Hold up, little man, I got a question. How'd your bigass daddy raise his boy to be so...
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2")]
[name="Texas"]   ...Boss.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Yeah yeah, go ahead.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   Anyway, about that ambush, it was definitely meant to provoke a reaction from MDL and Penguin Logistics.
[name="Bison"]   We can't take this sitting down. I can contact my father and the LGD. This is a case of aggravated assault...
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Hey, Texas.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Hm?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   What's for dinner?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8")]
[name="Exusiai"]   We're throwing a welcome party, of course! But where's Sora? Didn't she stay home to hold down the fort?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_201_moeshd#3",focus=2)]
[name="Croissant"]   Ya know she'll come a-runnin' soon as Texas gets on the horn.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   Oh, sorry. You were sayin'?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   (Sora?)
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   ...Um, the first order of business is to figure out who attacked us. Does Penguin Logistics have any leads?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Leads? It's a pretty basic business dispute.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   What do you mean, business dispute...?

[name="Emperor"]   Texas! Shouldn't I have a cigar in my hand by now?!
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Boss, it's been a while since we shacked up here. I think all your smokes went bad.
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Sora came here to clean before. She might have thrown them away.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Y'all for real? You tryin' to kill me? This is wack...
[name="Emperor"]   Yeah, you keep talkin.' Don't worry.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   Our first step should be to figure out exactly what these attackers were targeting...

[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[CameraShake(duration=1, xstrength=10, ystrength=12, vibrato=30, randomness=90, fadeout=true)]
[name="Emperor"]   Hold up, we need some tunes! Get some vinyl spinnin'! We got a whole box of them here, don't we?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#4")]
[name="Croissant"]   Purdy sure I hauled one over. A box worth a couple months' salary.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Found it. What do you want to hear?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Just throw on any one of 'em. Anything I picked out's gonna be fire.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   It ain't life without music. Bless. Nice tunes, nice me.
[name="Emperor"]   Bison, what else you got?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   ...Oh. Where was I?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Their target.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Right! Well, their target was me, I guess, to try to provoke our two companies.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   That's it? I figured it'd be some revenge thing...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   So you have a lead?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Sigh. Texas! Go scout 'em out!
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Texas"]   Triple overtime.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Um, we get into scuffles like that maybe twenty times a month. Doesn't every Messenger deal with this all the time?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...Why?
[name="Bison"]   Messengers should be quieter, quicker... you shouldn't be settling everything with violence all the time.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=2)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Huh. 
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   We're a logistics company. Why are we always getting involved in gang wars?
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   cause they got no taste. They don't value their own lives.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   And the baws signs our checks. We still get the goods where they need to go, all nice an' legal-like.
[name="Croissant"]   It's just we usually end up doin' some armed transport.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#8")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Yeah. Like, what's the big deal?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4")]
[name="Bison"]   Umm...? You're really okay with that?
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#2")]
[name="Texas"]   Ugh...
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   Wait a minute.
[name="Texas"]   Here, it's the passcode Sora left.

[name="Bison"]   C- cookies?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#6",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=1)]
[name="Exusiai"]   Aww, why'd she open them and leave them here. They're no good when they get all soggy.
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#6",name2="char_102_texas_1",focus=2)]
[name="Texas"]   The chocolate side is long, and the tail is short. That's the passcode.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2")]
[name="Bison"]   (That's some weird cryptography...)
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#2")]
[name="Croissant"]   Really? She wasn't kiddin' with that? 
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   ...All I did was memorize what Sora said.
[name="Texas"]   'Suspect.' Hm. Maybe she chased them out.
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   Let her go. It's quittin' time.
[name="Emperor"]   And we got Sauin, so no overtime. Forget about capitalist oppression. We gotta pour one out for the homies.
[name="Emperor"]   Who's drinkin' with me?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Croissant"]   Ooh, you buyin', baws? I heard some new top shelf booze just came in stock~
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   S'all good. You ladies got a lotta pay to dock, after all.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#5",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Croissant"]   No thanks!
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Wait! We... we never came up with a plan.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Don't need one.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#4",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   We just let the mob get away with this?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd")]
[name="Croissant"]   Play it by ear.
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd",name2="char_325_bison_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Bison"]   ...The LGD won't butt in?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Probably not. They're used to this stuff.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_103_angel_1#7",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Ugh...
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1")]
[name="Texas"]   It is what it is. Just go with the flow.
[name="Texas"]   But last month's property damage invoice was a little longer than usual. You all need to be more careful.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1")]
[name="Bison"]   So what's your typical work like?
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#3")]
[name="Exusiai"]   We deliver the cargo in accordance with the contract, and then we fight. But if we have to fight, that kinda takes precedence. 
[name="Exusiai"]   Oh and jobs go to the boss first. Then it's first come first serve, whoever can handle them.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1")]
[name="Bison"]   ......
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   Hey, little man. Your daddy trusted you to me. So you're part of the Penguin Logistics family now, even if it's just for a bit.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Er, yeah... I get it.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_105_emper",focus=2)]
[name="Emperor"]   And you gotta remember the first rule of Penguin Logistics: 'Don't sweat the small stuff.'
[Character(name="char_103_angel_1#7")]
[name="Exusiai"]   Wasn't the first rule 'live for the party' yesterday?
[Character(name="char_201_moeshd#4")]
[name="Croissant"]   The one I heard was 'carpe diem.'
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   ...pretty much.
[name="Emperor"]   Those ain't gonna be the last soldiers who wanna scoop you up and haul you off, but we're gonna take 'em one at a time. Simple as that.
[name="Emperor"]   Hold up, why's my ass feel funny? Somebody leave something in my perfect, ergonomic recliner?
[Character]
[name="Exusiai"]   Um, I'll take a look.
[name="Exusiai"]   Oh, what an adorable little candy box! Boss, you were hiding snacks under your chair!
[Character(name="char_105_emper")]
[name="Emperor"]   That's cap. Why would I stuff snacks in my... did you say candy box?
[Character]
[name="Exusiai"]   It's a box of candies. See, it says 'Victorian Gumdrops' right here...
[Character(name="char_102_texas_1#4")]
[name="Texas"]   Get back, Exusiai, don't open the——
[stopmusic(fadetime=0.5)]
