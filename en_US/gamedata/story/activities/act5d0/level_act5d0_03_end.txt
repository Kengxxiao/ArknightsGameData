[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   It's me, it's me! Let go!
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Huh? What are you doing here?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#2",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   I just closed up. I'm on my way home.
[name="Jaye"]   You're the one who's here spacing out—— Well, I guess it's not spacing out if you can flip around and snap my neck like that...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Did you hear that car accident just now, up on the overpass?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   ...aren't you supposed to be studying?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   One must strike a balance between recreation and labor. If I spent the whole night before the exam cramming, I'd go in there with my brain totally fried.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   Yeah, sure.
[name="Jaye"]   I heard some customers talking about it. I hope nobody died.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Same... but I heard something at the office. I guess there's some real unsavory characters mixed up in this...
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   Let's get this out of the way: I have nothing to do with any killers, gangs, or anyone in that world. You know that, right?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   Everybody knows your deal—— Or maybe I should just say, with this attitude of yours, it's natural to be a little suspicious?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   ...right. I get it.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   And there was a gas explosion on a highway in the outskirts just two hours ago.
[name="Waai Fu"]   A gas explosion on a highway? That's a pretty convenient explanation.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   Hey, you're not thinking...?
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Waai Fu"]   I told you: one must strike a balance between recreation and labor.
[Character(name="char_272_strong_1",name2="char_243_waaifu_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Jaye"]   ...right. I get it.
[name="Jaye"]   So is this recreation or labor?

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   I don't see any mafia-looking guys, but... aren't we letting our guard down a bit too much?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   What are you talking about? This place is a FIVE STAR recommendation. That's way more awesome than some mobsters.
[name="Mostima"]   You been able to contact Texas and them yet?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#3",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   No, it was so fast...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   So what's to be all nervous about?

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Your ice cream's melting. You gotta calm down already.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Er, it's just... nobody could have predicted this. I should calm down.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   These mobsters came aaall the way from Siracusa to Lungmen. We can bet they're not here for Sauin, right?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   ...They definitely have some other goal. One of them is me, but beyond that, I don't know.
[name="Bison"]   We're in a good position. We managed to lose them. And with just the two of us versus however many of them, we have the advantage in scouting them out...
[name="Bison"]   But how do we proceed? Should we start hunting them? No, the better move is to reconnect with Texas...
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Heh. You seem a lot more like an ordinary Messenger than Texas and the girls.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   Oh, sorry, was I talking to myself?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   No, you're right.
[name="Mostima"]   We know the mob is up to something, we can't just go off half cocked.
[name="Mostima"]   But sometimes you gotta trust in the girls. I know they can be a little out there, but Penguin Logistics is a tough cookie.
[name="Mostima"]   It's kind of weird to call a logistics firm 'tough,' but... Forget it. It's not like I've got any room to complain.
[name="Mostima"]   Let's just take a walk, enjoy the scenery. And maybe by the time we run into Texas and the crew, they'll have this whole gang war all wrapped up?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=1)]

[Character(name="char_325_bison_1#2",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   You see that candy store?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#4",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   It's really more of a stall than a store.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   Hm, it is pretty old.
[name="Mostima"]   I came here on a trip to Lungmen years ago.
[name="Mostima"]   Back then... I didn't have any Lungmen dollars on me. Honestly, I must've looked a sight. But still, I found myself drawn to the candy.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=1)]
[name="Bison"]   O... kay.
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1",focus=2)]
[name="Mostima"]   That's what a Messenger does. We get into trouble on our long and arduous journeys.

[name="Old Man"]   Sorry, but that's a secret I'll have to keep.
[name="Little Boy"]   That's not a star! It's just a candy with some food coloring!
[name="Little Girl"]   But I've never seen such a pretty candy before... you sure you don't want one?
[name="Little Boy"]   Y- you're such a pain! Don't they have any cotton candy?
[name="Old Man"]   Of course we do. Here, give me your hand.
[name="Little Girl"]   Oh... but I don't want cotton candy. I want that one...
[name="Little Boy"]   I hate fruity candies! They're too sweet! And they turn your tongue weird colors!
[name="Old Man"]   Just take what you want. No charge. For Sauin.
[name="Old Man"]   Now it's getting late. You kids hurry home and get to bed!
[name="Little Girl"]   Thanks, mister!
[name="Little Boy"]   Hurry up! I wanna go to the toy store and check out the limited Sauin knights they got!

[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]   Hmm...
[name="Mostima"]   We're in no hurry. The night is young.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]   Ho ho. And so are you. You two must be here for the downtown Carnival.

[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1")]
[name="Mostima"]   ...you enjoy the nightlife, sir?
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]   Not with these old bones I don't. But the candy I sell tends to make its way there for me.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]   Is there something special about this year's Carnival Gala? Looks like a lot of foreign guests in town.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]   Things have been quiet in this town for too many years. The people are definitely itching for the Carnival.
[name="Old Man"]   The Carnival brings in all kinds of characters showing up getting into all kinds of trouble. And that's pretty fun, isn't it?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1")]
[name="Mostima"]   Yeah, for sure.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]   The point of Sauin was always to see off the souls of the departed. If the living are having a good time, that's a decent sacrifice.
[name="Old Man"]   You really don't want anything? Last time, you stood outside with your face stuck to the display window. I thought I was gonna have to peel you off.
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]   Wow, you remember me? That's kind of embarrassing.
[Character]
[name="Old Man"]   Hah. How could I forget?
[Character(name="char_213_mostma_1#3")]
[name="Mostima"]   I'd love to. But I really can't be eating too many sweets before work.

[name="Bison"]   Okay?
[Character(name="char_325_bison_1",name2="char_213_mostma_1#2",focus=2)]
